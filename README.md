# Final Project for CDT 30380
## Abby Gervase
### Building the Corpus
The script that makes use of the Reddit API is located in the `scraper` folder. If the proper information for a Reddit API project is given (username, password, etc) then it will scrape the responses for r/WritingPrompts and store them in `data/texts`.

### The Corpus
The corpus is located in `data/texts`. The naming convention for the text files is `prompt{prompt number}_{response number}_{final score}.txt`.

### Text Analysis
The Jupyter Notebooks in which I performed the actual text analysis are in the `exercises` folder.
