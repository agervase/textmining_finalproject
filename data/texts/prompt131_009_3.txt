A salty taste rejoiced my lips and awoke me, I rubbed my forehead with the back of my burning hand and left a tasty lagoon on it. Slowly but surely I felt the unusual, scorching sun cooking me alive -- my sweat bubbling like oil. Suddenly, I realized that this dusty desert wasn't my bed and the panic kicked in, I was in god-knows-where getting calcinated and wearing nothing but my impure underwear.

I got up in a hurry, pantsing when a roll of white paper fell from the right side of my underwear, I desperately threw myself over it and opened it: "este es el examen final," it said, written in jet-black ink, $1000 pesos appeared as I unwrapped it. 

*"Im fucked,"* I thought to myself, I didn't understand a single bit of spanish and there was no man or car to be seen, not even in the horizon. The boiling hardpan casually melted the sole of my feet, forcing me to run in my tip toes. *"Oh God, Oh God, a three, something, I need shadow!"* I screamed internally, I had never seen such a vast space.

I frantically ran aimlessly through the empty inferno, my situation was hopeless or so I thought. A rock, a shinny enormous, miraculous rock popped out of nowhere 200 ft away from me. My feverish, light-blue eyes gave it a pained stare while my shrimp-coloured body ran fixed on it's tiptoes towards it -- God knows why I thought a gigant rock would save me. 

Only 100 ft separated me from my goal but the exhaustion was overwhelming, I couldn't run anymore so I strode the next 50 ft until my body gave up completely collapsing against the floor. The soreness of my throat, the dryness of my mouth and the hellfire in my skin intensified once I hit the hardpan. I had to choose: close my eyes and die slowly or crawl the last 50 ft gathering unhuman forces and torturing my body without certainty that the shadow of the rock would save me at this critical point.

I crawled, I crawled like a lizard, I gave my everything with each armful, the skin in my elbows and forearms were left behind like a trace in the hardpan, I could feel the bone limping against the aridity of the surface. I was almost there, only 10ft left, only 9ft left, 8ft left, 7ft left, 6, 5, 4, 3, only 2ft lef-.

*"He failed."* Said a misterious man sitting on top of the rock.
