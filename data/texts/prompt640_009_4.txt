Act I

"Am I the only one here seeing *this*?"

Anger was piloting Angela again. Nobody saw when he took control and it was always tiresome to get him out of the chair. 

"Cindy is dressed like a whore! This is a business environment! There are rules! Who she think she is?"

Joy approached him carefully and spoke in a soft voice:

"There, there, Anger. Where are the pills Dr. Chase gave us, huh? I think this is a good moment to take them". 

Anger turned his back to confront her and raised one eyebrow in disbelief:

"That's preposterous, Joy! How can you even suggest this? You know these things do to me!"

The discussion was getting hot (literally, as he head was already on fire) when Disgust intervened:

"Guys, people are looking at Angela now... I sense several judgemental looks. Angela should go to the bathroom". 

This was the last drop for Fear.

"Oh my god! Oh my god! They might suspect something is *wrong*. Soon they will lock us up in a hospice, Anger! We must take the pills! We *must* take the pills!"

Angela left her desk and headed toward the bathroom. Outside everything seemed normal, but inside it was a rollercoaster. 

"That's outrageous! We shan't do what others tells us to do! *We* give the orders! Not them!" Anger yelled "For Christ's sake, back me up here, Sadness! These *things* do more harm to you than they do to me!"

The rest of the gang were genuinely surprised when Sadness spoke up. She's had been quieter and quieter these days...

"You know, Anger? Sometimes we must do things we dislike. But that's okay..."

Sadness gradually approached Anger, but he wouldn't be swayed so easily:

"NO! That's not okay! Look what they're doing to you! Look what they're doing to me! To us!"

Meanwhile Angela finally took her pills. The crippling Fear took action before Anger could stop him.

Joy cheerfully hugged Fear. Everything would be okay in a couple of minutes.

That was the cue Anger needed to bust out of the room. Fear and Joy decided to share the panel control for the afternoon.

As Sadness retreated to the background as she always did, Disgust decided to check upon Anger.

It wouldn't be easy to talk to him right now, so she decided to bring some Yellow Memories along.
