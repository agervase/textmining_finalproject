What stuck me at first was the distinct lack of light. As I walked through the supposed pearly gates , I noticed that it had rusted at the edges and one of the gates was actually hanging oddly at the hinges , I wondered what the hell happened.


I thought logically for a few moments , but the existence of heaven was not something I was expecting to logically see , I actually was looking forward to a post physical existence but alas ! It was not to be.


The air was heavy and reeked of blood and flew in the face of the many descriptions of heaven in scriptures , I was not sure what was going on till I reached what seemed to be a church , only the top half was cleanly sheared off , like there was nothing there to begin with.


Ok now things were getting a bit unsettling , was this all some kind of weird acid trip ? Did I actually die ? Where the fuck was everyone ? Why was there an deficit of light around every structure I saw in this place ? These were just a few questions buzzing around in my head when I frigging tripped (good going clumsy ass ) as I slowly got up and adjusted my glasses ( what...) I saw what I had tripped over.


It was a kindly looking old man with a lush beard and hair combo , wreathed in an white robe stained liberally with shades of red everywhere he had inscriptions on his arms and was carrying a book which seemed to have a massive smoking hole in between , it took me a second to realise that I was actually looking at my conception of God ... No no no no this couldn't be happening to me no no no oh cra ....... I heard what seemed to be a roar from the darkness , a very guttural roar which seemed to have awakened some kind of primal fear inside me , I instinctively reached to my pocket to hopefully find a weapon of some sort 


I took the thing that came out and stared in disbelief. It was a goddamn pen ! Not again !!!!!
