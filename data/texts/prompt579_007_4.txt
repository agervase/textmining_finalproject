“Oy, Rupen, ya fancy yourself a minstrel now? Stow the theatrics,” Albrek demaned, inspecting the sword. The blade was surprisingly sharp despite being plunged in stone for Lord knows how long, and the hilt had an eye-catching design. Albrek knew a blacksmith in Yewhaven that could appraise the sword for him, no questions asked. 

Rupen, who was resting against a tree, perked up upon hearing his name. “You say somethin’, boss?”

“’Twas I who called to thee, adventurer!”  This time, Albrek saw that his right-hand man’s mouth didn’t move in the slightest. “I am the Sword of Legend, Dawnbreaker, and by releasing from my prison of stone thou have taken the first step toward destiny!”

Oh, great. *This* nonsense again.

“Listen here, Donny,” Albrek began. “If I had a gold coin for every cursed artifact, weapon of prophecy or wise ol’ hermit I’ve come across in my travels I’d be livin’ real pretty by now. First there was the Chalice of Youth, then the Bow of Gallowmere…”

“Alright, point made. You’re not impressed,” the disembodied voice sighed, dropping his previous mannerisms. “Listen, just go on this quest for me and you’ll be up to your eyeballs in gold. Sound like a deal?”

“Like hell I’m riskin’ my neck fightin’ demons or dragons when I can just sell ya to the highest bidder. C’mon, Rupen, we’re leavin’!”

Rupen, who had gotten used to seeing his boss converse with inanimate objects, followed Albrek out of the forest.

“Hold on, don’t just sell me! Take me to the boy mentioned in the prophecy, Barth! Hell, I’ll settle for any bland, idealistic teenager looking for adventure! I’ll make it worth your while! Please!”

Dawnbreaker goes ignored until the duo of bandits reach Yewhaven, where Fredrick the Blacksmith took the sword off their hands for a modest sum. As the pair left, Frederick called out to his son.

“Oy, Barth! Put this sword with all the others!”
