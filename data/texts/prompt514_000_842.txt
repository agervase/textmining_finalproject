*What's the point of panicking?* Jeff thought, as he watched the chaos unfold from the comfort of first class. His legs were stretched out fully, and the raucous turmoil around him was pleasantly muted by his noise canceling headphones. People rushed by him like clockwork, some probably screaming, others crying, though he didn't see what good it was doing any of them. 

*We’re all going to die anyways, so might as make the best out of it.*

Jeff hadn't started the voyage out in first class, but instead had slipped up a few rows once people started leaving their seats to start milling around the aisles like rabid lunatics. Finally, after 15 years of flying coach, he had attained the near mythical first class upgrade, and it only took a crisis which would almost certainly result in his doom to make it happen. 

*It's pleasant enough,* he thought vacantly, *but still, not anywhere near the price tag.*

The plane hit a patch of turbulence and everything shook. The lights flickered and streaks of sunlight flashed through the panes of the window. Jeff closed his eyes. *There's nothing you can do about this, so Just relax. Relax. Breathe in. Breathe out. Relax.*

There was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned to his right. Sitting next to him was a well dressed man, kicking up his feet next to him. His head was shaved and he wore a pair of dark glasses.

Jeff took off his headphones. “Yes?”

“You're in my seat,” he said. 

“Oh, sorry.” Jeff started to stand up, his polite reflexes taking control. Even in moments of mortal peril his manners stubbornly refused to desert him, which he found quite amusing. As he made to sidle by, the man shook his head and motioned for him sit back down. 

“It's okay, stay put. I enjoy the company.” He crossed his legs, apparently enjoying the extra leg room as much as Jeff. “Besides, every seat on this plane is mine.”

Jeff looked at the man, now confused. The man had a small bag of free peanuts in his hands, and began to fumble with the plastic. “Hate these things,” he muttered. “They seal 'em up tighter'n than my – ”

The bag burst open, showering the pair with peanuts. “Sorry about that,” the man said. “God, what a nightmare. I hate delayed flights.”

Jeff reached for his headphones again, but stopped, realizing that the strange man had traded him a nice seat for a conversation partner. “Well technically, this plane isn't delayed. It's just taking, you know, hours longer than usual and eventually going to run out of fuel and crash, which in my opinion is quite a bit more worrying.”

“Ha.” The man crunched down on a peanut. “There's nothing to worry about.” He glanced down at an expensive looking watch. “Actually, we're ahead of schedule. Should be beginning our descent within the next hour or so. No, it was getting the board to approve this type of flight in the first place that was the real problem. You think a two hour flight delay is bad? Try a *two year* delay.”

Jeff frowned. He often felt uncomfortable when people talked nonsense, though this man seemed pleasant enough. “I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I have no idea what you are talking about.”

The man took off his glasses and smiled. His eyes were pale blue, circled by worn laugh lines. “Well of course you don't. You're supposed to be flying coach, after all. That's the whole point.” Just then the clouds broke away, and brilliant white and green light flooded the window panes. 

Jeff turned his head to look out his window and gasped. The scene before him looked like something out of  a surreal painting. A series of what appeared to be floating isles dotted the skies, each a bright emerald green. Some held mountains, others hills and valleys, tiny villages popping on some, their rooftops no bigger than toys from this perspective. Far off in the distance he could see the skyline of a  massive city, the tops of the skyscrapers faded behind a curtain of fog. What appeared to be tiny vehicles zipped back and forth from isle to isle endlessly like insects.

Jeff's mouth fell open. He turned back to the man. “Where are we? Have I...have I gone mad?”

The man smiled. “Two years,” he said. “Two years, and now, finally, I'm going home.” A hush had fallen over the entire plane, as the other passengers crowded around the windows, everyone sharing in expressions of varied disbelief.

“Your...home?” 

"That's what I said." He stretched in his seat. "God I'm thirsty. What's a man have to do to get some first class service here?" The strange man seemed to have lost interest in Jeff's bewilderment, and took to trying to wave down one of the hostesses to order a whiskey and coke, to little success. 

Jeff grabbed him by the shoulder and jerked him back around. “Hey! Did you...did you have something to do with this?”

He shrugged. “It was the board that approved it. Take it up with them.”

“The board? What in the hell are you talking about? And where are we?”

The man opened his mouth to respond, but jut then a new hostess that Jeff did not recognize appeared before them. She was dressed in bright blue uniform that was different than the ones that had started his flight, though maybe that was just what they wore in first class. 

“We should be arriving at our destination shortly,” she said, with a pleasant smile, as if they were about to finish a normal flight and the floating isles outside the window were a normal part of Korean Air's flight experience. “Something to drink for you gentleman?”

“Whiskey coke double,” the man said, then added, “took you long enough.”

Jeff looked up at her and smiled reflexively.  “Coffee with two – hey. Wait. We're going to be *arriving* shortly?”

The hostess held her smile. “Yes, of course sir. You didn't think we would keep you up here all day, did you?”

“I don't know what to believe anymore.” He pointed out the window. “And where exactly, will we be landing?”

The smile never wavered, and without breaking character she handed them both their drinks, along with a pair of parachutes. “Who said anything about landing?”

Jeff looked over at his seat partner, his mind refusing to process the last interaction.

“Dammit, mine's too small,” the strange man complained, sloshing soda-whiskey everywhere as he fumbled to undo the straps of his parachute. “Switch with me.”
