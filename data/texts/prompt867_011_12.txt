"I'm also a drug user. Copious amounts!" I can hear my own disbelief. 

The interviewer shrugs. "You're in your prime, Mr. Johnson. Not many men can run the football quite as well as you."

"I have an arrest record."

"Yes, and a rushing record. That's why you're here."

"Wh...what? I'm saying I have a real problem, man. I'm a kid, mid to early 20's. I come from nothing. And now I've been given tens of millions of dollars. I don't know how to handle that kind of money or the attention that comes with it. I spent three years in a college that encouraged me to take the easiest fucking classes so I can pass and play. Most of my teammates read at a 5th grade level, some were illiterate. And now I'm... I'm in too deep, man. For fucks sake, I see my face on fucking billboards, I'm on tv! I'm a brand! My ego walks into the room before I do and it's palpable. Women throw themselves at me. And for what? It's no surprise I turn to drugs to cope. But that's what I'm saying, man. I need help... I got a problem."

"How's your knee holding up?"

"Excuse me?"

"Your knees, Mr. Johnson. They checked out in your physical but we want to hear it from you. How are your knees?"

"....They're fine, man."

"Fantastic! Sign here."

"Okay, okay. Wait... I've hit women in the past. I mean... I mean, I'm not proud of it. Not at all. I hate myself for it. Can you understand me though? My professional working life is spent pummeling others and getting pummeled on a weekly basis and tens of thousands of mongoloids watch and celebrate. Even since I was a fucking child, I have been praised by my ability to physically brutalize others.  I'm not proud of it. No. But I just don't know how to handle my anger, my problems. I've never learned another way. Why? Because I've never needed to. I think I deserve something, I have an inflated sense of who I am. The truth is, I'm a barbarian. Its what people pay me to do, people like you." 

"Just sign here, Mr. Johnson. Welcome to the team."
