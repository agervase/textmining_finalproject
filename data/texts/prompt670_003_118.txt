Humanity had spent centuries looking to the stars for some signs of life.  The most hopeful - and painful - stretch of recorded human history, at least to date.  We'd seen nothing.  Heard nothing.  Knew nothing of the wars that raged between the stars, the vast fortunes of conquerors and conquered turning over and over in the black.  Not the slightest inkling that our own solar system had been known since the time of the pyramids by three different names to three different species quite unlike our own, the second having eradicated the first around the time of the Renaissance, and the third having having wreaked such economic devastation on the second that ours and two dozen other systems had been traded away in a bid for peace as our first artificial satellites settled into high orbit around Earth.  Those most recent claimants had established colonies on the bones of their predecessors, sprawling across the plains of Pluto and Charon and spreading among the sparse halo of rocky detritus making up the Kuiper belt beyond.

Our first meeting was one of almost startling coincidence; we and they, both testing the limits of our technological means in an unintentionally synchronous push to the asteroid Ceres.  It was an exercise in existential dread for the both of us.  Neither armed, neither prepared.  Though no strangers to unfamiliar sapient life, they'd never seen our like.  It gave us common ground.  It gave us something to talk about, once the means of doing so was puzzled through.

We learned much from them; that the galaxy was full of life at least as advanced as ourselves, and that it always seemed to develop along one of two very distinct evolutionary pathways.  Genes of silicon and sluggish hydrocarbons were the norm, representing the vast majority of catalogued life.  Our new neighbors - their initial claims of ownership quickly discarded in favor of the far greater intellectual bounty that peace offered - were of this type.  Clusters of crystalline organs tumbling across each other beneath a clear amoeboid skin, pressed tight within a second and equally clear artificial skin that served the same purpose as our own bulky space suits.  The others, the rarer breed, were bipedal and somewhat humanoid in form.  Their genes were things of sulfur and beryllium, and though known to our new friends no member of any such species had ever been encountered by them.  Not personally, at least - they commanded a significant presence in scientific and commercial circles.  Just not a physical one.  We fit neither mould.  It explained much.  We'd been looking for life as we knew it, and so had everyone else.  They'd found what they were looking for.  We hadn't.

It was disheartening at first - by all external measures our Earth was both uninhabitable and without economic value.  Too hot for our new friends, too close to its parent star, too saturated with iron and oxygen compounds to be of any real value.  For the others - the ones so unlike them, and us - the entire solar system was a write-off.  Even the crushing pressure and heat on Venus' surface were too mild an environment for them to consider making even a temporary home of it.

Our vaunted adaptability was objectively lesser than either of the extremes occupied by life as they knew it, but as we shared our knowledge it became apparent that this was a greater gift than we could have possibly imagined.  There was a vast middle ground between those two poles, and it was all ours.  Over a quarter of the galaxy had been meticulously catalogued - filled almost beyond counting with little atmosphere-bearing rocks that they could neither colonize nor make meaningful use of.  Our Goldilocks Zone was their No Man's Land.  As our relationship strengthened we found a great deal of cultural similarities between our peoples, even allowing for our vastly divergent physical forms.  The standout exception was buried in our creation myths.  The persistent echoing across cultural epochs of their allegorical stories of origin seemed to forecast our own distant future, but with one notable absence.  They had no Prometheus, no Icarus.  *No written word for fire.*  For us, though - for humanity - it is the very soul of our being.  The free-standing flame.  Controlled and controlling, all-consumimg essence of Man.  We are Icarus.  We are Prometheus.  Thieves and porters and lovers of flame.  In our oldest myths we'd stolen it away from the gods.

We make preparations now to give it back.
