"What the hell is this?"

/u/Shower_Expert scrolled through the top 25 furiously. He had a shower thought hit the front page almost daily, and was unquestionably one of the subreddit's most popular users.

He muttered to himself as he read the titles in his head.

*A goblin has decided to run for mayor of the peasant village.*

*Time travel is possible, but you can only go back a maximum of five years.*

*Space monkeys have invaded Earth, and you're the only zookeeper left.*

/u/Shower_Expert shook his head and leaned back in his chair. This glitch didn't seem likely to disappear anytime soon. In order to regain his glory and prove the merit of his very username, it was time to take matters into his own hands.

/u/The_Writer_Fellow scrolled merrily through the front page of /r/writingprompts, diving in for his sixth story of the day.

*If I toast bread, why can't I bread toast?*

*Damn, that's brilliant,* Writer_Fellow thought. *I've gotta jump on this one.*

The recent prompts had been a bit more philosophical in nature, but that was perfectly fine. It allowed him to dive deeper into the very core of his psyche, and pour his heart out into his work.

*Chef Andrews was about to make the most daring leap the restaurant industry had ever seen,* Writer_Fellow typed. *He removed the piece of toast delicately from the toaster, coated it in butter, and set it atop a bed of bread crumbs. Then, with a deft touch only provided by the experts of any given craft, he began to roll the toast in the crumbs. It was a culinary rebirth, and the world of fine foods would never be the same.*

/u/The_Writer_Fellow leaned back and re-read his work, then proudly hit submit. *Fucking masterpiece,* he thought.

/u/Shower_Expert had successfully hacked into the /r/showerthoughts moderation panel, but something had gone terribly wrong.

Instead of plugging in Shower Thoughts, he'd pasted in the URL for /r/all. He hadn't noticed until it was too late.

Now, the subreddit was pulling in posts from every corner of the site. Videos, NSFW pictures, an obscure page devoted solely to nectarine farming. It was chaos.

Shower_Expert checked his mail and noticed a message from a Reddit administrator. A ban, effective immediately. 

He had brought doom upon The Front Page of the Internet, and the faulty code was spreading like a virus to every other page.

/u/The_Writer_Fellow sighed. The prompt submissions were just getting stranger and stranger.

*Deadpool tops the box office for the third week in a row.*

*Here's my baby husky buddy!*

*I grew my biggest nectarine yet! Check it out!*

Writer_Fellow cracked his knuckles and shrugged. Over the next two hours, he wrote an epic saga chronicling the life of a nectarine farmer in the Midwest. It wasn't easy, but sometimes you have to make sacrifices in pursuit of the Great American Novel.
