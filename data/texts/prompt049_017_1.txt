My own truck was stuttering across the interstate. The vehicle had been aging about as well as milk. The blue paint on its sides peeled up to reveal the primary stages of rust. A few layers of bumper stickers on the back spouted views I really didn't care for, those I spray painted over. But for all of the aesthetical shortcomings the car retained two real pieces of value, it works and it was cheap. Bought off some dingy looking lot next to an Arby's. The dealer was friendly at least, gave me an "Off-the-books" discount. Every time he said the words he talked a mile a minute, the straight lace side of him clashing with the compassion. Maybe once the clunker gave its last wheezing breath I'd go back, but not till then. No, this car was mine and goddammit did it work. 

Maybe the best part about it was the radio. A dinosaur in comparison to any other on the road, yet the thin muffled static made each song feel a little more real. Each tune off of *William White's Western Whistlers* was almost haunting through the dusted speakers. The age of the tune was only matched by my leather jacket. The black material warmed to a great extent by the sun. Whoever stole a glance at my rustic truck and I would swear we had come straight off an album cover. 

I kept rolling across the cross country stretch of asphalt. Watching the iron railing appear and disappear with the hills and tree lines. A cascade of cars went around me through the fast lane. I'd take a glance at each one, getting any scrap of personality I could about the people who passed me. It was almost a game at this point. Turns out the most impatient people are the ones with the little metal fish, *weird*. I watched as a white sedan began to drive past. For a moment our cars were neck and neck, two-ton racehorses steaming across the track. My curiosity got the best of me. I took a glance to the left. A red-haired woman sat behind the wheel, hands gripped firmly on it. I looked back into my own lane. Her car swerved as if it were a toy being flicked. It hit my rear, hard. I was horizontal to the road. The deafening horn of a truck. My neck jerked. The floor shifted. Through the raining glass, I saw the road, no railing. The car floated for a moment. The truck smashed through the hill. My torso wedged halfway out of the seatbelt. Warm blood dripped across my forehead. I felt the car give one final rock and opened my eyes. The grass was above me. The seatbelt dug hard into my leg and stomach. It snapped. My back hit the roof of the car, shattered glass scratching through my jacket. Smoke drifted through the open windows, the clunker gave out. I put one arm forward, shards of glass shifted with me. I gripped hard on the frame and pulled. My stomach stung with each inch until my torso hit the grass. My head was spinning. The forest seemed to get darker.

*Play the guitar; Play it again, my Johnny*

I opened my eyes. My legs were pulsing. I was awake, but the forest was getting darker. I could hardly see the tree line twenty feet ahead. The blue sky was a murky veil of ink. I kept pulling myself across the grass. The blindness continued approaching me. Shadow blanketed me for a brief moment. A spotlight blared upon me. The light was not warm, almost stale. The same kind of light flashed into your eyes in the dentist chair. akin to the middle school play auditions, blinding light, and a freezing, painful sweat. I tried to look up, to find the source. A creaking sound echoed just beyond the light's radius. A stench rolled upon the dirt, a horrifying smell that dared not lift to the sky. The smell of rot. I tried to look back to the clunker, only the faint sound of the radio could be heard. 

*What if you go, What if you stay, I love you*

The creaking persisted. I looked ahead but it came from each angle. The sound of ancient trees splintering. The tip of a bone planted itself ahead of me. A face came into light, a paper-thin layer of rotting skin clung to the sharp skull. Its head was the size of the truck's cab. Hollow cave-like eyes stared through me. An animal tilting it's head in curiosity. The skeletal hand slid closer through the earth. 

"Please no," I croaked, my throat was dry.

*What if you're cruel, you can be kind I know*

It crept closer. The hand was the size of the truck bed. Massive fingers ready to prod. The top of the torso peered through the darkness, rusting iron armor hung upon its chest. It raised the hand and opened its mouth. Blackened teeth were set deep into the jaw. The stench was unbearable. 

*There was never a man like my Johnny,*

*Like the one they call Johnny Guitar.*

I felt the hot breath trickle out of its open nose. I almost invited the warmth. The light was unrelenting. A heavy hand was lifted into the air. The still grass below waved gently with it. A shadow fell across me. Another faint sound filled the clearing, just muffled by the radio. A woman. Her voice from just beyond the darkness. The skull slowly turned. Hollow eyes searching into nothing. I heard the voice again, a woman.

*Play it again*

I saw the sky.

*Johnny Guitar*
