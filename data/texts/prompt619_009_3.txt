I wasn't as excited for Christmas as most kids. See, I've never actually gotten to open presents. No, every year I make my way downstairs defeated knowing what I'll see. Not perfectly wrapped presents, not a giant pile of toys waiting for me to dive into. No, I know what I'll see on Christmas morning. 

I sighed as I stood up and shook off my grogginess. I started my way down stairs with a short pit stop in the bathroom. At the top of the stairs I heard the familiar sound of wrapping paper crinkling. 

"Hi Jesus." I say without even seeing him yet. I was halfway down the stairs before I could see the top of his head. The long flowing locks rested on his shoulders and was the color of sand. 

"It's my birthday Michael not yours! These presents should be for me not you." Jesus said without even turning to look at me as I reached the bottom step. 

"Do we have to do this every year? Can't you just take the gifts and leave without rubbing it in?"

"No, you were chosen for a reason Michael. You are the best kid in the whole world. That's why I get your gifts. One day this will all pay off. I need to see you and tell you every year that this will pay off, I promise." Jesus talked as he walked towards me with presents in his arms. 

"I know all that, but can't I just have one present? I mean how is it fair that you get ALL gifts?" I didn't care that I sounded a little whiny. How would you have sounded at 9 if someone took your presents every year?

"No, these are mine. Keep being the amazing child you are and this will all payoff. I'll see you next year." Jesus looked at the door and at me. I opened the door and he walked down the street presents overflowing in his arms. 

"Did Jesus take your presents again?!" My dad said annoyed from the top of the stairs.
