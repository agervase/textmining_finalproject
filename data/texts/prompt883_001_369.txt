Bobby ticked off the boxes one by one. Intelligence? 0. Strength? 0. Charisma? Bobby hesitated. Maybe a few points here and there couldn't hut. But no. It was all or nothing. Bobby finished penciling in zeros, and came to the bottom of the list. Luck. Grinning, he wrote in "20" and handed the form to the secretary.

"You sure, kid?" She eyed him almost sympathetically.

"Yes ma'am." Bobby nodded.

"Alright, take a seat."

Bobby sat back down. A few minutes later, a man in a lab coat appeared and called him into another room.

"My name is Dr. Sanderson." The man said. "10 intelligence. What are you getting done?"

"Luck." Bobby replied.

"Oh my." Dr. Sanderson looked at Bobby's sheet. "If you really think that's best."

"I'm sure." Bobby scowled. He was sick of everyone questioning him.

"Well, just lie down here." Dr. Sanderson said, gesturing to a white cot. Bobby complied as Dr. Sanderson strapped various machines to Bobby's body. Bobby had no idea what they were, but he knew what they were there for. To make him lucky.

"You may feel some slight pain. That's fine." Dr. Sanderson continued as he poked an IV into Bobby's arm. "The procedure will begin here. Once this part is done, we'll send you and your form downstairs for the finalization. Ok?"

"Ok."

"Well then. Away we go." Dr. Sanderson pressed a large green button on the wall. Bobby felt a tingling sensation across his entire body. He closed his eyes and felt himself change.

"Even before finalization, the effects should manifest. In fact, you may already be lucky right now! I once had a man put 16 into intelligence. He figured out how to perform the finalization before I even unstrapped him. He was a real asshole."

The machines whirred with activity. Bobby smiled. He was going to be lucky. He would have...what was the word...why couldn't he remember...wealth! That was it! Money! Power! Love! His friends would be jealous, especially...uh...what was his name? Juke? Juice? Jub-jub? No, that wasn't it. Bobby's arms hung like limp noodles off the side of the cot. His head was heavy.

"Should be just about finished!" Dr. Sanderson said. He slipped Bobby's form through a slot in the wall. "Hope you feel ok."

Bobby' form was sucked into a pneumatic tube and launched into the hands of Dr. Garret (9 Intelligence) a floor below.

"Aw geez. Look at this." He called to his colleague, Dr. Wilson (10 Intelligence).

"Another fortune seeker?"

"Looks like it. Put all 20 in luck."

"What an idiot. I tell every teenager I know: you need a spread. You need to be versatile. But they all want to go all in on something."

"It's not the worst thing in the world. Jonathan McElroy went all in on intelligence."

"Yeah, god bless him. Can't even get out of bed, but his ideas are powering the whole country. And with his exoskeleton project, they say strength will be a dump stat soon. No more brainless meatheads wrecking the office. But remember Ryan Porter?" Dr. Wilson stamped Bobby's form and placed it into another tray.

"Your neighbor's kid?"

"Yeah. Sank all his points into luck last year."

"How'd that turn out?" Dr. Garret punched a code into his console. Bobby's form was sucked back into another tube.

"Same as everyone else. It's luck, not divine intervention. He won the lottery--and split it with the other 40,672 winners, as usual, bumped into his soul mate, and landed a dream job just by showing up."

"Sounds good. Maybe I should have gone with luck."

Dr. Wilson scoffed. "But then it turned sour. There wasn't much lottery money after it was all split up. His soulmate was a perfect woman--which meant she didn't have to settle for a barely coherent sack of bones. He managed to coast by on sheer luck for a while at work, but eventually he couldn't hid his incompetence. So now he's homeless and single. It could be worse. People always happen to have enough money to give him some, and restaurant owners always feel generous when he's hanging around. But come on. That's not a life. He can hardly form a complete sentence, and he has to crawl because his legs are so weak."

"Alright. I see your point."

"Never max out one stat. That's words to live by."

Within the workings of the office, something was going wrong. Bobby's form was supposed to be scanned and copied. The original would go to the public records in the basement. The copy would go to the finalization room. But something was screwy. It's hard to say what or why. But somehow, in the copying, Bobby's form got all messed up.

Bobby walked into the finalization room, supported by two orderlies.

"Final me, peas, duck!" He announced to Dr. Horace (9 intelligence).

"Of course." Dr. Horace responded, rolling his eyes. He grabbed the copy of Bobby's form from where it shot out of the wall and placed it into the nearby machine. He sat Bobby in a chair beneath a dome and casually flipped a switch on the wall.

Nothing happened.

Dr. Horace watched Bobby expectantly. The machine did not hum to life. Dr. Horace frowned. He pulled Bobby's form out from the machine and called up the original on the computer.

"Oh my." He raised an eyebrow.

"Whassss rong, duck?" Bobby asked.

"These forms don't match. Take a look. Is this what you wanted?"

Dr. Horace handed Bobby a form. Bobby concentrated, trying to read the symbols on the paper.

**Intelligence: 6. Strength: 3. Charisma: 4. Dexterity: 3. Luck: 4.**

"N-no...I wan luck. Alllllllll luuuuuuck."

"Oh boy." Dr. Horace grimaced. "You'll have to go back upstairs and tell them what happened. They'll reverse the procedure. Then you need to start over."

"Noooooooo." Bobby mumbled.

"I would be happy if I were you, young man. 20 points in luck? Absurd. Honestly, this glitched copy is a very good spread. It wouldn't be a bad idea to just use this distribution. Off you go now."

"Urrrrrgh." Bobby muttered as the orderlies dragged him out.

"Honestly, it's in your best interest! You have a chance to fix your mistake!" Dr. Horace called after him. "This was quite the lucky break!"
