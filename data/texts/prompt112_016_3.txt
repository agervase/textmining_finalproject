It was 20th April. The short man stood at the memorial that was made in his honor on the same day, around 500 years ago. It was his birthday. Every year they resurrected his statue in his name on this day to remember his life. He did not bother keeping track of the date and which year it was, but he had seen enough to wish death upon himself. 

But can the dead really die again? 

It had all started with the girl. She had rejected him publicly and her kind ridiculed him for it. Her kind, the outsiders. He had always wished good things for his people and felt that his country was plundered by theses wretched ones. Everything he said in public created a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria, which further propagated his belief that the outsiders were to be exterminated. 

So he became the FÃ¼hrer and dealt a blow to their kind. 

But the next few decades saw the rise of the outsiders in the free world and they controlled most of the economy. A small group of  these 'Untermensch' had vowed to never forget him and take over the world as revenge, taking apart and undoing everything he had worked for. 

Now, thousands of years later, he was regarded as the true Evil one. Just when he thought he could rest in peace forever, the small population that survived the 5 nuclear wars had come together and decided that he was the reason why Nuclear weapons had come into existence. 
They erected a statue in Germany and desecrated it by any means possible. Every year on this day they came together and violated his effigy as some sort of a sick festival. 

The only way he could console himself was that he brought humanity back together for a single cause albeit a cause he did not care for.
