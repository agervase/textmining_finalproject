Ah, Shannon. She was a beautiful gal. Long brown hair, and bright green eyes that Carl so adored. 

"Today's the day," he thought. 

He hoisted himself off of the park bench, slinging his backpack over his shoulder. It was difficult for him to carry, containing *one whole book*, along with a few pages he had torn out of a picture book in the library. He walked over to Shannon, who was eating a banana and looking fine as ever. 

"Shannon," he said, "I've been meaning to tell you something for a while now. You - you smell like a month-old bag of assorted murder victims that got shat on by a rhinoceros, then tossed into the Hudson river and left to ferment for a millennia, then, when the fermentation process was complete, left out in the smoldering July sun."

Shannon reached out to slap him, but slipped and fell, landing face-first in a pile of mud. She got up, shouted a plethora of profanities, then wiped herself off and trotted away furiously. 

"Damn you, Charisma stat!" he muttered to himself.

After stopping for a rest multiple times on his way to class, desperately regretting his choice of putting no points into Endurance, he stepped in to Ms. Briggs' classroom, only fifteen minutes late for his final exam. Looking quite perturbed, she handed him a sheet of paper and urged him to sit down in his seat. He did, but when he looked at the exam, he quickly realized that he hadn't retained any information over the entire semester. 

"Damn you, Intelligence stat," he whispered, or rather, tried to whisper. In reality, she shouted it loud enough to attract the attention of the entire classroom, and get a passerby in the hall to look through the door's window. 

"**DAMN YOU SNEAK STAT!**" he shouted, this time intentionally.

Carl shuffled through his mail, finding primarily scholarship forms and college acceptance letters addressed to the wrong people. Just when he had given up hope of finding anything worth his time, he noticed a hefty wad of $100 bills sitting at the bottom of the mailbox.

"Worth it!" he shouted.
