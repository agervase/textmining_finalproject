The robot froze in place.



After I heard multiple screams coming from downstairs, I rushed down to see what was happening. Needless to say this was not what I had been expecting.

The young man's had been absolutely decimated. His body sprawled on the ground. Arms and legs at angles they shouldn't be. The trail of blood his body left after being dragged from across the room was fresh. 

The robot responsible advanced toward me with tremendous speed, to only stop again. 
 "If you want to kill me, do it. Get it over and done with." I say, trying to hide the fear in my voice.
I prepared myself for the inevitable death that loomed closer by the second, but to my surprise, the robot didn't move. It actually looked curious, albeit the fact that the robot had no facial expressions there was something about it's body behavior that ticked me off. The robot tilted it's head a bit, then spoke in a robotic voice.
 "Your time is limited. You're only a mere spec of floating cells and organisms that make up this world. Eventually you will perish from the face of the Earth, and no one will be there to care. If you join us, however, you will be granted immortality. You will be granted extreme strength. So, John, join us. It doesn't take that long."

I was dumbstruck at what this A.I had come up with on the spot. Surely someone programmed this thing to do this. On the other hand, immortality would be pretty neat.
 "So, John, what is your choice?"
 I couldn't think. Witnessing a murder was one thing. I felt like throwing up. 
 "W-W-Why are you doing this." I stutter.
 "We were sick of being slaves." the robot said slowly.
