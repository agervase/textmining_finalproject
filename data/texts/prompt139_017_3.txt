I was born with an uncommon mental disability that caused me to be blind. There was nothing wrong with my eyes per se, my brain just wasn't using them for some reason. I tried hypnosis, tried eye massage, nothing worked - so I just got on with life and learned to sense my surroundings with vibrations and sounds. It was a challenge, but enough to get by. Think of the Daredevil TV show, I always liked listening to that - he's blind but he can do kung fu and stuff - inspiring to say the least for someone born blind like myself. I can't do kung fu but I can catch a tennis ball and swat a fly, not half bad for a blind person. Daredevil, as fictional as he was, was a great role model for me in coping with blindness.

I was quite content just being blind, happy to accept my lot and live my life, learning how to sense my surroundings with other ways - until recently when this new technology came out in the news that was able to use AI to connect brain signals with other parts of the brain. All of a sudden when I heard that there was a cure to my condition, I was \*completely\* unsatisfied with my lot, and just \*had\* to get it! They needed a beta tester so I applied. There was a lot of demand for the product so it was super expensive, and it was more than a little risky since they were basically inserting a computer into my brain, but I didn't care. I had to go through a few interviews but eventually they picked me for the operation. I was ecstatic.

&#x200B;

So I would have this chip implanted in my head (kind of like a cochlear implant) that would essentially tell my brain to pay attention to everything the eyes had to offer. I had my flatmate Jack read to me everything he could glean about it on the internet for weeks, that was nice of him - I could talk for hours about how it works but I'll spare you. I had been so excited to finally be able to see, my friends can testify that I've talked about little else since it came out - it was beginning to get on their nerves how I was always talking about it so I won't bore you with the details. 

&#x200B;

Anyway I spent almost my whole life savings and borrowed a whole lot of money from my parents to get the implant, and now here I am, sitting in the hospital, able to see for the first time, looking around. Honestly, not what I expected, but I'm happy and I'm grateful. 

&#x200B;

At first, when I first woke up from my operation, my face went bright red. I had never seen people before and now here I was looking at them. It made me blush. They let me rest in my room for a while though so I got used to it by the time the doctors came to take off my bandage. They were nervous because they weren't sure about how the operation had gone. I tried telling them the operation went great and I was fine but they wanted to see me with the bandage off to be sure, they made a big event of it.

&#x200B;

I looked around the hospital at all the people doing their thing - patients resting on their beds, nurses taking care of them, stuff like that. A really attractive lady on the floor above caught my attention, I couldn't wait for the doctors to let me go so I could get an opportunity to go talk to her. "Congratulations Steve! Welcome to the world of the seeing!" the doctor declared once my bandage was fully removed, and I was distracted from the beautiful woman walking away. My mate Jack extended his hand and after it dawned on me he was going for a handshake, I shook it. He patted me on the back and gave me a hug.

&#x200B;

It was an emotional moment for everybody, not just myself. My dad was clearly holding back tears, the doctor was beaming with delight, pride at his success more than happy to see me see but thats okay. We made so much noise that the patients next door turned their heads to look, though not directly at me for some reason, perhaps they were shy? Again, I'm not sure why everybody waited for the head bandage to come off before they got all excited though, I've been able to see since I woke up from the operation.

&#x200B;

"How many fingers am I holding up?" Jack asked. He was holding up three fingers in front of me and four fingers behind his back - but as he asked how many fingers he was \*holding up\*, I figured he meant only the one hand that was in front of me so I replied "three". 

&#x200B;

"WRONG!! Hahaha it was seven! I had four behind my back as well!"

"Yeah I know but wait I don't get it man, you said how many you were holding up..."

"Its a joke Steve relax. You can see, thats what matters. I'm so happy for you"

&#x200B;

I tried telling him I knew he was holding up seven fingers but he wasn't having any of it. I didn't get whatever joke he was trying to tell but I was happy and his laughter was contagious, we were all in high spirits because I had my sight back so I laughed with him. It was so good to be able to see.

&#x200B;

I saw my mum walking briskly down the corridor to see me - she had been held up at work and was unable to come earlier. I waved at her but she avoided eye contact with me for some reason until she walked through the door - \*then\* she was totally happy to see me. Maybe she had been lost in thought on her way down the corridor, maybe she was embarrassed about being late, I didn't know. Anyway the first thing she wanted to do was give me a hug, which was actually super awkward for me now that I could see her - but I just told myself that this is what everybody does, what I've always done since I was little and I didn't want to be weird or ungrateful in this happy moment so I just hugged her and smiled. It would take a little getting used to, this seeing everything.

One of the doctors asked me to stand on a certain spot on the floor and read letters on a sign on the opposite wall. I couldn't read obviously (I must remember to start studying as soon as I get home), so he replaced it with another sign with little arrows - if the arrow was pointing left, I should point left - or right, up or down. I got every single one right (it was super easy) and everybody was all very impressed. Apparently I could see more than they could - they couldn't make out the little ones from far away for some reason, and that was the first hint that somehow maybe I was different. 

&#x200B;

Great! The operation had been such a success, it had given me really good eyesight! This was exciting. I guess this means I can see things far away, and other people can't. I looked at a man working at his desk in an office building across the road and waved at him, tried to get his attention. He didn't see me, I guess I'm too far away for him to see. The other people in the room didn't even see what I was waving at. This was going to be fun.
