I'm a bit late and Kinda broke the promt. Stuck with the reaper theme and suddenly lost track.

 But here goes

**Deaths’s true friend**

&#x200B;

“I could have been at home, watching Rush Hour again, had it not been for your stupid negligent attitude. Do you think I WANTED TO carry you to the after-life. You don’t get to take that tone with me”, I said as I recklessly turned every turn in the cosmos en route to Death, my boss. 

“Oh for crying out loud, I wasn’t dead and I was totally alright. I didn’t need you. I could be alive now had it not been for you meddling.”

“Meddling? You drove drunk, at 90 miles an hour, straight into a barricade. That sounds dead to me. And for the record, I work here. I don’t make the call.”

“Well you could grow a spine and tell your boss I wasn’t his to claim,” screamed the still intoxicated soul. Terrible enough alive, they're worse outside the bodies.

“Spine! I didn’t come there till my buddy from the coroner’s office gave me a green light. Besides,if I didn’t show up one of my colleagues would have.

Oh save your wide eyed stare, you think one person can handle every drunk driver cancer patient and god knows what else. You know how many souls are harvested in a day? Anyway I'm done with you, you are now Tyrone's problem. You know what to do right Tyrone?" I asked Death's registrar. He would sift through records to determine whether this man would ascend, into heaven or descend into hell.

A delivery complete, that should give me another twenty minutes on Rush Hour, they say re-watches with friends are fun, but I wouldn’t know. It’s really hard when you’re only interaction is with dead souls. They’re always too bitter to talk to you, and they head to heaven or hell never to meet again. Work buddies don’t exist, Death insists we don’t interact with each other. For fear of us going "soft". I should have just accepted hell when I passed, it couldn’t be worse than this. I heard rumours from Tyrone that torture buddies tend to form strong bonds of bonhomie. That’s what the Cosmopolitan: Hell Division says anyway. "When was the last time I had a friend" I muttered to myself

&#x200B;

Back to the grind, another suicide attempt. As a reaper, these are the hardest transfers to make. These souls are “different” neither morose nor angry. Not even relieved or calm. Just turbulent. They all put up their facades, but they are pierced through in an instant.

&#x200B;

“Hey, I was here to pick you up. I’m really sorry you didn’t enjoy your chance at Earth. I’ll shut up now. But I’m ready to listen,” I said, as per routine. Picking up trembling, volatile souls like these always put us reapers in a grim state. In their turmoil they lash at us leaving bruises. I don’t mind getting lashed out by souls in turmoil, but these souls, they hurt to carry.  Premature death always leaves me in a terrible state.

“I’m fine sweetie, there's no need to worry about me.” A trembling, frail voice responded. Shocked, I looked down and my eyes went wider nearly crashing into Mars. You do not want to crash into a planet. The paperwork is not friendly.

The vibrations from this soul really started to grow in bursts but the darkness began to fade.

“I lived a content life and a long life. But at 80 on life support, it was time for me to go. I just hope my loved ones live on well without me. You see, grandmas are cherished so much.”

I was more than happy to listen and slowed down to prolong this conversation.

“My grandson would miss me the most, He really looked up to me and would hate walking into the hospital to not see me. He would always sit on my lap look at me, rapt as I told him stories from the holy books to fables and childhood stories. He tells me he wants to become a writer so he can share stories, just like I did for him. He’s a gem of a kid and I’ll miss him even from heaven.”

“You know, if you want I can take you back. It won’t be any trouble. It’s hardly been any earth seconds and the doctors can still save your body.” Now I know that’s not the ethical thing for a grim reaper to do, but it’s what I wanted.

&#x200B;

"I've made my mind up and I truly want to go. I'm frail and on medications. It's not a life I enjoy living. My grandson and family will be in my heart forever. But I've made my call."

&#x200B;

"But did you ever get a chance to say goodbye Grannie? Surely another week, just for closure? One final good-bye."

&#x200B;

"Oh my sweet summer child, there is no final good-bye. If they had it their way I'd never leave. I'm old and frail and they were all expecting it. Hoping for later rather than sooner."

&#x200B;

"But surely another week. Another morsel of your wisdom and compassion. Final words and a final goodbye. Wouldn't they want that."

&#x200B;

"Oh I'm sure they would. But the deed is done. My place is here in the heavens. In eternity. I have a husband I've not met in a long time. They know to look into their hearts to find me."

&#x200B;

"If that's what you want, I'll bid you adieu. Here's Tyrone who will now guide you."

&#x200B;

For the first time in a long time, I was unwilling to make a delivery. But I had no choice. Bargaining never helps and this I know to be true. Granny, here's to true. I hope you find solace and meet your Husband soon. I'll put in a word with Tyrone too. Just so you know, little Timmy will forever miss you.
