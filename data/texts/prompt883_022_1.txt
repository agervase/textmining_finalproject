"Well, son, it seems the cancer, AIDS, Ebola, and Rickets have somehow cancelled each other out. It's a miracle of science. You have a clean bill of health."

I nodded.

"Thanks Doc!"

On my way out of the hospital, I spotted a $50 note lying on the ground. As I bent over to pick it up I heard a whistle and a crash of breaking glass behind me. Holding the note, I turned around to discover a bullet hole in the door. No one else seemed to have noticed and I was going to be late for work if I stayed.

I stepped onto the sidewalk and was looking for a taxi to hail when someone beeped at me. I stared quizzically at the attractive stranger behind the wheel of a very nice luxury car. He waved me over. When I got closer I recognized him. It was Donny, my fifth grade crush. You know how some kids look good with little kid features, but when they grow into their face they get all Hailey Joel Osmond? That's not what had happened to Donny. I got in the car.

It turned out I was Donny's fifth grade crush too. And his car had windows that would darken their tint on voice command. He set the autopilot to take the long way to my work.

We were doing some hot and sweaty catching up when I saw the tanker truck out of the corner of my eye. It was barreling towards us full speed in the wrong lane. I gasped, which Donny interpreted as a sign he should keep doing what he was doing. Before I could react further, a giant chunk of flaming metal fell out of the sky and slammed into the truck, stopping it dead. I just barely made out a TV network logo as Donny's car turned off onto the exit ramp.

I got to work with five minutes to spare.
