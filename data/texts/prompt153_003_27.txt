Ninety-seven years, four months, twelve days: not a bad record to go out on. I can't see anymore; there's no enough strength left to open my eyes. I know my family is here, though, I can hear them. My kids, their kids, their kids' kids. I know all their names. I remember being there to welcome each and every one of them into the world. Even if there is no heaven or hell, so long as a man leaves a family behind there is life after death. 

That's a good line to go out on.

I let out one final breath and let go...

I was never very religious; that was my wife. I didn't know if I'd ever see anything again, but even if I did I didn't expect this. I'm sitting in a big red armchair on a stage. There's a big-screen TV in front of me and a studio audience full of people watching me. The stage lights are so bright I can't see their faces. A man walks on the stage and approaches me.

"Are you Steve Thompson?" he asks.

I nod.

"Born November 2nd, 1920; died February 15th, 2018?"

I nod again.

The man gives me a warm smile and pats me on the shoulder. "I know you're probably confused, but don't worry, there's nothing here to be afraid of." He turns to face the audience. "Hello, viewers, I'm your host, Bob Saget, and this is *Steve Thompson's Funniest Deaths!*"

The TV turns on. I see my mother. She's lying on a bed in a hospital, breathing heavily while a doctor and nurse attend to her. I haven't seen my mother in almost fifty years. I don't think I've ever seen her looking so young. She's sweating and obviously in pain, but she looks so beautiful I want to cry.

That's when the narration begins.

*"Gee, Dr. Butterfingers, I hope you know what you're doing!"*

It's the host. I can't see him - I can't physically turn away from the TV, no matter how hard I try. I know it's him, though. I can hear him right next to me, speaking in a comically high-pitched voice.

*"I know exactly what I'm doing, Nurse Brenda. Now just let me stand on this banana peel."*

My mother screams in pain. The doctor kneels down between her legs and pulls a wailing infant out of her. I know immediately that it's me. The doctor tries to stand up but he slips and I fall out of his arms. There's a cartoonish "SPLAT!" sound followed by the sad trombone sound that used to play when a contestant lost on that game show my wife used to love.

*"Darn it, that's the third time this week!"*

The audience roars in laughter.

---

It's been hours now. I sit here, unable to turn away from the screen as I watch myself die as a baby over and over and over again. Right now I'm looking at myself sleeping.

*"I sure do love my new crib! I sure do hope I don't get Sudden Infant Death Syndrome!"*

My infant self stops moving. The sad trombone plays. The audience laughs. This is the eighty-fifth time the host has told the same joke.

---

It's been weeks now. Maybe months. On the TV I'm a little boy, barely three years old. 

*"Oh boy, I love my new tricycle!"*

The host never stops. Every time a new scene starts he begins narrating.

*"I'm going to show the man driving that car my new tricycle! I hope he's paying attention!"*

Cartoon splat. Sad trombone. Audience laughs. The next clip starts.

Hell is real and I am there.

*"Oh boy, a hot dog! I sure hope a piece doesn't get lodged in my windpipe!"*
