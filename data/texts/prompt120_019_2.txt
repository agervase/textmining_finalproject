I was seven when my father left. I really don't like thinking about it. I've shoved the memory so deep into it's own box that some days I forget I even had a father. And yet, the details are as fresh as the day it happened when I do let myself remember. 
Mother and Father had been arguing behind their closed bedroom door. My sister Amelia and I tried to hear what about but their low tones didn't quite make it through. 
When the door suddenly opened we both scrambled to look nonchalant. Had our parents not been so preoccupied we would have failed miserably. As it was they barely noticed us  waiting for them. 
"I'm going to get some milk." My father pulled me into the tightest hug he had ever given me. "Watch over your sister and mother, James. Keep them safe and remember that I love you."
As he hugged my sister I was confused. The store was two blocks away. I could, and often did, walk there and back in very little time. Why did my mother look as though she was losing her best friend? 
But that was 50 years ago today and the anniversary always stirs the memory. I've often wondered if my mother knew he wasn't coming back and why she staunchly defends him to this day. She refuses to accept that he abandoned us, though I'd learned not to suggest it long ago. For her, this is a day of mourning.
Amelia and I returned to our childhood home to be with our mother as we do in this day every year. As we entered the kitchen I noticed two things immediately; 1) Father was sitting in his chair at the head of the table holding hands with Mother and 2) he hadn't aged a day. 
"Hello children."
