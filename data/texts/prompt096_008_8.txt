Guys, priests, supernatural experts, quantum physicists, anyone, please help. I don't even know who the fuck I'm supposed to ask, what ancient primordial forces I may have invoked or offended, or how my actions will affect humanity for millennia to come.

But, I'm pretty sure I just killed Blood Mary.

It's late at night, and we're a couple of miles down the road from Peggy Sue's Classic Diner. After having just murdered a supernatural entity I'm strangely hungry. I am also freaking the hell out. My friends are all texting furiously, likely trying to reach out in vain to their co-workers and relatives. Most of them are drunk. I wish I was too. My other friend, a light drinker, is sitting on the hood, poking her pale, unhinged jaw. She's stiff as a board and rocking back and forth with each poke. A bit of black fluid is dribbling onto the pavement from where her eyes should be. She's definitely not human. She has what look like reverse-articulated legs, and long, scaly claws for hands. Her hair is silky smooth and black, because even ghouls appreciate L'oreal apparently.

Sorry, as I was describing her I realized we should probably conceal the body until we're ready to figure out what the hell we should do. She is now lying behind the SUV which is parked on the side of the road. We're mostly surrounded by desert, but a car does pass by every few minutes or so. We are on route 15, the path between the bastions of civilization that are SoCal and Las Vegas. This place is, un-ironically, a good place to ditch a body. Moving her was a bitch and a half. In addition to being surprisingly heavy, her body is ice cold. My fingers are feeling better now though.

Uh, so anyways, how did this happen? Well, it's not a long story actually. We were driving back from Las Vegas. Spring break isn't over yet, but we decided to save a day for some down time from all the drunken gambling and shows. One of us mentioned some kind of psychic-busting live show thing he saw on Youtube once but that we couldn't find in Las Vegas. The conversation kinda snowballed into a frenzy about supernatural bullshit, and culminated with someone repeating Bloody Mary to the side mirror as a joke. He was especially drunk, so when he started laughing maniacally and urging us to drive faster, we naturally took it in stride. I even put the pedal to the medal at one point just so we could push "Blood Mary" to the limits. We were all laughing.

As my friend keeps gibbering to himself, even he thought he was hallucinating. So when a desert wildcat darted in front of my high beams and forced me to slam the breaks, the last thing I expected was to hear a thud *behind* the car.   We stopped, and I was going to check outside, but then our pursuer just appeared in front of the car in a flash. We saw the atypical face that was typical of the Bloody Mary phenomenon, and for whatever reason I decided to slam the gas again, just out of panic. Basically she hit us and, well, I hit her back.

So here we are, all congregated around the SUV, still stealing glances at the dead creature. We tried taking pictures, but they all come out blurry and distorted. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't relieved that my first pedestrian run-over wasn't an old lady, but rather a fabled horror. But, I still feel pretty bad.

Hey, so, good news! We don't have to anything anymore! :D

Her body is gone.

We had arrived at the conclusion that the best thing to do was bury her and then leave an anonymous tip so that some scientists can come pick her up. But just as we started looking for something we could use as a shovel, someone pointed out that Bloody Mary was gone. There is no trace of her, though there is still a very small dent in the back bumper. But quite frankly I don't give a fuck anymore. The problem solved itself, and I am relieved. We are going to head back to SoCal, and we're just gonna try to forget this whole thing happened. Bloody Mary? More like Bloody Bitch! Hah!

I'm gonna sleep all day tomorrow.

Anyways, thanks for listening to my tale. This was honestly a relief, even if we didn't need the help of the Ghostbusters. But yah, that'll teach Bloody Mary not to chase after cars. Peace!
