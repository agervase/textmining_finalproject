Frank blew out the candles with a melancholy smile. The family laughed at his joke, but he felt a twinge of sadness as he looked at the smoking 39. He remembered seeing the same sight 54 years ago. The only difference is that he no longer walked, he rolled; and he couldn’t wipe his own ass. He was grateful to be surrounded by people he loved and who loved him, but that didn’t stop him from wishing that he could rewind the clock a bit. Life’s just not as great when your kid has to lift you onto the toilet seat.  
	
“Grandpa Frank, did you make a wish?” His great-granddaughter asked.

“I sure did, Baby. I sure did.” 

He cut into the cake and took a piece that had *py 93rd* scrawled in green frosting. 

The next morning a blaring alarm woke Frank. He mechanically reached over and hit the off switch before it struck him that he hadn’t set an alarm since he retired. *What the fuck is going on?* he thought. He wanted to pinch himself to see if he was in a dream but couldn’t bring himself to do it. 

The next moment he found himself rolling over and kissing the back of his wife’s head. He thought he was going to scream; his wife had been dead for 20 years. Instead, he found himself standing up and tucking the covers under the pillows. He could walk, his wife was alive. Was the last half century just some vivid dream? He tried walking to the bathroom to look at himself, but instead his legs carried him over to his closet and he began putting on clothes.

He began to panic. He wasn’t in control of his body. It was like watching himself through a movie shot in first person while snugged up in a straitjacket. When his body walked down to the kitchen, it pulled out a slice of cake left over from the night before. Scrawled in green frosting was *py 39th*. 

*Well, this is gonna be a long movie*, he thought. *Better get used to it*. 

He wondered what would happen on his next 93rd birthday.
