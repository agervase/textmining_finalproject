Part 1,

A table of people is sitting in a dark room,

"This woman has no powers, no special abilities, not intuition towards anything, why is she of interest?", 

"Sir, she has survived death two hundred and seventy eight times, there is something in her that we need, if we put her against a battery of tests, if we channel whatever is in her, this could have significant impacts for us and better all of society." 

"278 times, that must be a joke!"

"I have been following her for nearly 10 years, she has survived things that would kill any normal person."

"We do not just kidnap people off of the street, we were established for the betterment of society, if it were not for us, if it were not for this organization, all of society would have crumbled dozens of times over."

"All the more reason to go forward, she has no family, she has no friends, provided she survives the test, we already have number 181, but this is unlike anything else, we can mold her, we can shape her, she is of too much interest of this organization." 

"Okay, okay, you have convinced me, but what do you propose?" 

"We will send a strike team to her apartment, no one will even know we were there." 

"Are you sure he has no one, I do not want to have to deal with the paperwork, with having to deal with any family members or friends looking for her?" 

"Our research indicates that she was the sole survivor of a home invasion as a child and she went to live with his grandparents who have since passed away, she has no boyfriend or living family, not even a cousin, no social media, not anything."   
"Before we go in guns blazing, before we go taking someone we will give her an opportunity, a fire team is of last resort."

"I will authorize this, but if something gets screwed up, if we are compromised, it is your head"

If it is liked I'll write more, but this is my first WP, so don't be too harsh.
