*Adjusting to the light, I was in disbelief. There was the same tan speckled carpeting. In th corner was a barrel of actions figures, hot wheels, Legos. Along th left was was the same cement block shelving. It was filled with the Disney VHS tapes I grew up with. In the center of the room, around the CRT TV, was the two floral print couches that every week, my family sat down enjoyed movie night on. STAR WARS V: The Empire Strikes Back was playing. On the couch I could make out the back of a small kid's head. The shaggy brown hair was sticking up in random directions. Stepping through the door, my hair ran across the popcorn ceiling that seemed so tall back then. Taking my second favorite seat, my father's usual spot, on the couch I watched the duel in cloud city unfold. On the small wooden coffee table in front of us was the VHS set for Star Wars.( 4,5,6). I felt heavy, my chest tighten, and the picture became clouded with the tears that welled up in my eyes. I knew what was coming, but it wasn't going to be any easier. The iconic scene unfolded, where Luke is fitted with a new hand. The seven year old turned to me and asked the same question I asked my father all those years ago.* 


"Is that real? Can we do that?" *Asked the child, his bright brown eyes full of wonder. It's strange that I could see the moment where my life dream was planted into my head. Taking a deep breath, I tried to steady my voice.*


"Not yet, it's only a movie" *I managed to get out before my throat closed up.*


"You were suppose to. You promised." *whined the 7 year old.* 


*I didn't have an answer. How do I tell a child that we had to give up? That life got in the way. I did promise, and I tried but in the end I couldn't keep it. I stayed silent for a very long time. Content to watch watch the rest of the series. Return of the Jedi came to a close, finally spoke.*


"You want to watch the seventh one?"
