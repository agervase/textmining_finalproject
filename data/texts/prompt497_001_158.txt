"Gosh dangit....." Mark's voice crackled over the earpiece. It had that sort of cadence that also told me that he was very likely stroking his head in frustration. His large, bald, likely glistening head. It was a hot day at Buckingham Palace, and he was holed up in a building opposite, likely in a room that was way too small with A/C that didn't work.

And I knew what the problem was. Weeks ago, he had contacted me with a special assignment. Having just gotten fired from The Laughing Donkey, I was at the end of my rope, so I had no choice but to accept. The concept was utterly ridiculous, but the money was great, so I had to take it. Essentially, he(or some other knob higher up in management) had theory that mindreaders were roaming around London, stealing credit card information from citizens and then buying all sorts of stupid shit. Mostly, I thought it was stupid, because who walks around just thinking of their credit card numbers like that? It seemed completely implausible.

Until his idea worked. I walked around the most heavily populated streets of London, thinking of jokes. It'll make them laugh, and then we'll get them, Mark explained. There was only one minor hitch - There was a reason I got fired from The Laughing Donkey in the first place. My jokes were terrible. Initially, Mark had thought there was some sort of critical flaw in his plan because nobody was chuckling, or sniggering, or even smiling. This was until I realised the reactions of people around me as I told the story of the pickup lines and the bar at the truck stop. Then Mark realised what he should have been looking for - People burying their faces in their hands and walking away as fast as they could. This even worked because exasperation was much, much easier to spot.

On this day, I had gone out, with my best/worst toilet humour in tow. They'd gotten smarter by then. They called themselves the Hood, and we were having some trouble tracking their remaining members down. They knew the rough details of our operation by now, and were working hard to keep their reactions to themselves. This meant that my material had to get increasingly provocative. Today, as I usually did, I pretended to read a newspaper while sitting on the porch of the Monocle Cafe. Always important to keep my face concealed, in case they recognise me. Then, I got down to work. It helped that I visualised my thoughts in block letters. I had no idea if it helped me project further or not, but it certainly felt better.

"Let's go, Fred."

First time trying this thing out! I know this one's pretty linear, but I'd appreciate any feedback :)
