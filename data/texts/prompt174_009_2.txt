"Libby!" he hissed under his breath. "Your glamour is slipping."

Her eyes flickered towards him and he could see the faintest of pouts. Oh boy. Judging from that mischievous twinkle in her eye, he was going to pay for that later when they were alone.

Nevertheless, she spared a thought to readjust her outer appearance to relatively match what her expected age was - give or take a few decades. Not that anyone really noticed. Beyond 90 was the new frontier when it came to women's looks.

The dinner was a bit dull and, as a result of Phillip having taken care over the years to establish that he was withdrawing more as the years went on, he moved his attention inwards, thinking of strategies and future plans to improve the monarchy as well as holidays with the family.

Ah, family. It had been a long time since he had seen his. Libby, being the Queen and reigning monarch, was constantly surrounded by hers, but his had been more or less left to fend for themselves. Not that they minded. It was much easier to disappear for long periods of time without anyone noticing when one wasn't in the public spotlight.

*'Phillip.'*

Her harsh telepathic rebuke snapped him out of his inner reflection, causing him to reaction with the motions of an elderly man having abruptly woken up from his nap. He got himself mid-reaction and did his best to seem less startled. It wasn't very successful.

He could hear her chuckle telepathically and he scowled.

*'Godsdammit, woman. I was thinking about world domination.'*

*'No, you weren't, darling,'* she replied teasingly. *'That wasn't your "planning world domination" face. That was your "I can't wait to get to the bedroom and try all these naughty fantasies" face.'*

Phillip scowled again. *'Woman, you are going to be the death of me.'*

*'I don't doubt that,'* she chuckled again. *'After all, as you've pointed out many times, that is my goal in life.'*
