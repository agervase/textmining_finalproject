God if I have to make another trip up these stairs. It's easy for her, she's still so young, but every time she yells I've got to make this damn walk and tell her everything is fine. 

It's hard enough to even hear her bellowing. I worked the best part of my life in a factory, with the clang of machinery. Don't even think of asking how many decades, but it was more than most of you lot have been around. I've lost my upper registers of hearing. Some of the middle too. All of the lower. 

Coming down. Jesus, walking down these fucking things is probably harder than walking up them, and I'm taking my time because... well, stopping at every goddamn step is easier than prancing down them like the gazelle I used to be.

It gives me some time to think, and makes me wonder. Why? Susan isn't the scared type. She's normally so mature, so controlled. But I can't seem to settle her tonight, she's all panicky. So why is she making up such ridiculous stories? She keeps saying it's there, it's under the bed. I don't understand what could have prompted it. I'll tell you what I'm **not** going to do, and that's check. Not least because bending over is a one way trip, but officially because I don't want to encourage this sort of behaviour. 

She's not a scaredy cat, she knows the difference between reality and fantasy. And it's not like she has allergies. I told her it couldn't possibly be here. They're just not found around here. How the hell would one even be under her bed?! It's just silly. I told her she's too old for this nonsense. I told her that everything was fine. But she just keeps saying it. Keeps telling me what's there, under her bed. I get it, I get it, you don't have to keep saying it.

Honestly, why would a 25 year old woman be afraid of a lobster anyway?
