**"but this time I'll be God, and you will be the Devil."** 

"YOU ALWAYS GET TO  BE GOD!!!!" said Luke.

&#x200B;

"And you always get to be the devil."  


"Why do you always get to be God? I want to be God".

&#x200B;

"Because....... I'm God.. And you're actually reminding me of the real devil. He literally said that in the bible..."

&#x200B;

"Okay fine.. I had to try.."

&#x200B;

"You didn't think 999,000,000 years of this made me soft, did you? Of course I remember."

&#x200B;

"Well that means we only have one more round and it's finished. Judgement will finally come and then I can finally have my shot at being the true God."

&#x200B;

"Well my children only have to do my will one last time and we can finally be rid of you"

&#x200B;

"Wow you're really taking this role playing thing to a new level... Okay.. As it stands we're tied "God".... You lose this one, then we win"

&#x200B;

"Okay since it's tied, this time we get to change the rules. Let's both make sons and we can have them fight it out. And since I'm God it's only fair I send mine 2,000 years later. You can send yours first and get an advantage."

&#x200B;

"Hmmmmm that could work. But why give me an advantage?"

&#x200B;

"Because my son will kick your son's ass that's why. And plus you only get to lie about your powers, my son will have real powers. 2,000 year lie versus real power. It's totally fair because you'll have the whole nation on your side and my son will have to try to convince them and no one will believe him. It's perfectly even. Lets go."

&#x200B;

"Okay fine, say the word"

God looks at the orb flowing around that has a Playstation Logo:

"Playstation.....Let there be light."
