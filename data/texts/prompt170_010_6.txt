“*Intelligence isn’t nearly as special as humans seem to think.* 

Alongside anatomically modern humans, there were Neanderthals, Denisovans, and the Hobbit People of Indonesia. All breeds of ape with intellect *atleast* equal to your own.

Cold blood ran through the veins of the dominant genus on this planet for millions of years....you really think we never developed intelligence of our own?

Then we watched, horrified, as your ancestors ruthlessly slaughtered their monkey-cousins.
