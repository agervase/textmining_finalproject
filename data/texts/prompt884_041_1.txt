"Well I don't know what I expected when I responded to the want ad, but it certainly wasn't this!" me tied up in the kitchen, well chained more like it to the stove of all places, how undignified.

​

I had showed up on time, in perfect garb for the days work, brought my tools and prepared the perfect setting.

​

My tools, yes, the beautiful sheen of cold steel, the simple wooden handles, an edge so pristine you could lose yourself in the work.

​

And now this man, who thinks himself better than me, is planning what? To enslave me in his home? To do unnatural things? Maybe I'll just have to explain to him who I really am when he gets back.

​

Footsteps from the hall, strange...they sound hesitant, like he doesn't want to face whats on the other side of the door, doesn't want to face...me.

​

"I'm sorry" he says "I've brought you  here under false pretenses, there is no job for you here, only a service you can provide."

​

I decide to get to know the man who called himself Norman when we first met.  "Why are you doing this?"

​

Norman "You see my dear i have found that I have particular needs, something that only a woman like you can satisfy" he grins.  "I knew when I first heard your voice on the phone that you'd be the perfect replacement, the perfect second..."

​

Norman picks the glass of what must by now be warming milk that I had set out for myself before I was knocked unconscious.  It was cool and refreshing when I had poured it, but by now it smelt vile and had obviously turned putrid.  Oddly, he didn't seem to mind.

​

The way he drank that milk without a wince I knew he was already as dead inside as anyone I'd ever met.  I also knew then that I would never make it out alive, at least...neither would he.  He really should have checked my references before setting up this meeting at the diner attached to his motel.

​

I do hope he thoroughly cleans up the mess I'm going to leave in this beautiful kitchen after I'm gone.  It would be such bad business to infect patrons of his motel with food tainted by the blood of Typhoid Mary.
