“Fuckkkk today.” I mumbled, walking to Section 7 Pod D, my placement for Shutdown day. I had just left from an argument with my partner and honestly couldn’t believe today was the day. We had both been stressed for days leading up to today. It only made sense today was the day it would finally boil over. Although, I still don’t know how they could have said what they did right before we separated to go off to our pod placements and sleep for the next century.

When I stepped in my pod I just stood and thought, “At least I’ll have a hundred years to think of a comeback.” 

I look around, seeing others eyes slowly shutting, reopening only after a hundred more years. I start to close mine, but then see something dart out of the corner of my eye.

That’s when I saw them. My two best friends. 

For the last few weeks they had been on conspiracy forums online that led them to the conclusion that Shutdown Day was actually “Extermination Day.” I didn’t believe them considering for the last few years every conspiracy theory they had, & I had been a part of, ended up with all three of us looking like fools and our weekends spent in Detention Holding Cell Block 3.

My Pod started counting down... “Section 7 Pod D sleep cycle commencing, 10... 9... 8...” 

I see my two friends at my Pod’s control panel. I’m mouthing words they’ve heard me share far more than once from our past history of countless stupid endeavors. 

“7.... 6.... 5... 4...” 

A flash of sparks lights up my pod. “Error! Error!” My Pod hatch shoots off and my friends grab me. 

“Hurry!” “We don’t have a lot of time and we still need to get Sam!” They look horrified. I know something is not right.

I’m trying to keep up pace and start to ask questions but they say there’s no time.

As we’re running to Sam’s Pod I start to look into other pods that have started the sleep cycle. Something seems off. 

We reach Sam’s Pod. Now is when I really start to panic. I still haven’t thought of a come back...
