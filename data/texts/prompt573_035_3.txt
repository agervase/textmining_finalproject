There’s a glitch in the matrix. No, no not that movie. I’m just using the saying. Everyone gets a chance at a flip. They win the toss, they get to keep living at whatever age they choose; They lose, they go on to the afterlife.   

&nbsp;

And I’ve seen some lucky cusses, one girl actually won 12 in a row. This isn’t about her. No, I’m talking about the Glitch, Mr. Connors. He’s here every day, for over 25 years and he ALWAYS wins the toss. ALWAYS. I know it’s obvious since he gets a new toss every day.  That’s the next thing, every day, every SINGLE day, he’s back here, waiting for his toss. At some point he asked if he had to flip, seemed pointless, I said, “Of course, deem da rules.”  Around the 10th day I spoke with my boss and he spoke with his boss, who then spoke to his boss. I guess it eventually reached THE Boss. Word I got back, business as usual, if he keeps coming in, then keep flipping the coin and don’t stress about, it’s fine.  

&nbsp;

The last thing, the last bug is a dozy. He doesn’t just return and continue his timeline, no, he just vanishes and then, poof, back again the next day. Never seen it before, in all my time and it’s been a long time. So, I included this anomaly in my follow-up inquiry. This one didn’t even get up the chain. My boss just said, “The Boss spoke. So, The Boss knows. Just do what he says.”  So that’s that. He keeps coming in, usually muttering about an accursed rodent or something, and he keeps winning and I just do my job.
