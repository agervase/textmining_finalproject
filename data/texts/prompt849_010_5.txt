I stood engulfed in darkness. The only light came from a small machine in front of me that read ‘$1= 1 more day’. My heart was racing as I realised I could see my family again, I wouldn’t have to miss my child’s graduation and my wife would not be lonely. I shoved my hands into my pockets and dug out a handful of change. I hurriedly fed the coins into the slot at a pace that suggested I feared the machine would vanish if I wasn’t quick enough. ‘Thank You’ the screen read, and the darkness took over. 

I woke up in my bed, sweating and panicked. I heard my wife downstairs chatting to my son, cooking what smelled like french toast. I threw my legs over the edge of the bed and rushed downstairs. We weren’t a rich family and we lacked a lot of the comforts of financial stability, but we were happy. My wife greeted me with a smile as if she hadn’t seen me laying dead and blue on the bathroom floor  the morning previous due to a heart attack. My son barely looked up from his phone. My heart was full as I realised that all it would take is a dollar a day to stay with my family. 

We had a wonderful day, my wife and I went for a walk on the pier while our son was at school. We laughed and joked and everything felt better than it had ever been. We had dinner as a family that night and watched a movie together. When we got to bed, my wife turned to me with love in her eyes and said ‘honey, we’re having another baby’. I could’ve screamed for joy. Another baby! Finally! We’d given up on trying when our attempts seemed fruitless and accepted that we were lucky enough to have one child. But here we were! Another little baby! I closed my eyes and felt the happiest I’d ever been, knowing I got a second chance at life. 

I awoke in the darkness again, faced by the same machine. $2 for another day. Easy. I reached my hand into my pocket and froze. 

I had given my son the change from my pocket. 

I had no way to pay for another day.
