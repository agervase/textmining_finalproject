A dark, mysterious figure stood in front of me.

"Who are you?" I asked.

"Take a wild guess." It responded. It's voice was scratchy, croaky, unidentifiable. It was hard to find out what gender it was.

"Rob? I'm... so sorry... I was hurt when you cheated on me, so I-" "No. Guess again."

"Sera? My parents made me move to another country! I swear I didn't-" "Try again."

"Mama? I'm sorry for-" "No."

"Papa! I didn't mean to-" "No."

"Cherry? To be honest, I didn't-" "No."

The mysterious figure continued to annoy me. I was growing impatient.

"Who are you?" I said, reaching out to grab it's wrist. When I touched it slightly, the darkness faded and revealed a beautiful woman.

"I am you."

She was... beautiful.

She looked nothing like me. Her hair was a beautiful creamy brown. Her eyes simmered in the light. Her skin was clear, and her lips were plump and red. Her body was curvy and slim.

And I? I was the exact opposite.

"How? You stupid fucking liar, your nothing like me! Don't fucking play games here! I need to get into heaven!" I shouted impatiently.

"But I am."

"How?! Your hair is long, mine is short!"

"You bleached your hair too much that you just cut it off. It could have been beautiful."

"That isn't my eye color!"

"It used to be. Remember that laser eyes surgery?"

"Y-your skin..! It's clear, mine is dry and... pimples, so many pimples!" I started to tear up.

"You used too much product and makeup. If you only let nature take it's toll."

"I-I-you...! Why..."

"Why  d o e s    i    t      h    u      r      t .      .      .      ?     "

"Because it's true. You pushed yourself to be what everyone else wanted. You didn't become what you truly are."

"Stop... it hurts too much already... don't make me relive it..."

"No. You hurt me too much."

"You're hurting ME too much!"



"I.  DoN't. CaRe."



The last thing I remember was being pushed down, away from Heaven. Straight into Hell.

And I deserved it.
