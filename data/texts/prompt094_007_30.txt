The Monks at the Temple of Forever felt The Shock in the Ether as the Rune was Cast, they were to call forth Cthulu. Each Monk pulled forth a ceremonial dagger, laid on their assigned symbols and slit their throats. Cthulu Awakened. Above, the Earth was being laid to waste by the Alien invaders, smaller craft embedded themselves into the Earth and stalked about burning and ripping the world apart, whilst massive machines of death roved the skies and the stars. The Alien Mother ship sat silent, unmoving, observing the destruction wrought by its creations. Then it sensed it, a pulsating mass moving from the oceans, heaving, writhing, coming. Cthulu had arrived. The Motherships focus turned, and it let out a defending blast, an immortal challenge. Cthulu responded. The Motherships spoke, "Arrogant, infantile creatures you struggle against forces beyond your comprehension. What you have summoned is but the last gasp of your dying breath." "But we will fight," came a lone voice, "We will fight till we win, if we run out of ships, we will use guns, when we run out of guns we will use use our hands and when our hands fail us, we use our final strength to summon our worst nightmare, Cthulu." "Foolish beings, you exist because we allow it, and you will die because we demand it." Cthulus mass broke the surface of the Pacific Ocean and raced into the heavens. The immortal horror of the underworld radiated with an immortal howl as it smashed headlong into the Massive Frame of the Reaper known as Harbinger. Instantly, the reaper fleet turned toward the collosall mass and brought to bear there powerful beams of death. Reaper weaponry from the Earth, Skies and the Heavens lit up and bore into the immortal Cthulu..... It had begun, the battle for Earth.
