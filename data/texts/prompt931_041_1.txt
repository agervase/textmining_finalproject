So, the reporter asked me about my last edition plan.  
A little convoluted and chance dependant, - I said- I kidnapped hitler as a kid in a timeline and dropped him in a very radical bolshevik family in the heart of the russian revolution. When he was an adult, I kidnapped him again and gave him liberal amounts of GHB and rohypnol so he lost his memory, or at least he would believe his past was an hallucination, because, check this, I dropped him in a pile of corpses at Stalingrad. It worked! He was convinced he was from that timeline and all his confusion was due to the shellshock.  
Now I had to follow him everywhere because I couldn't really track him with battle reports in case he was killed because records from russians were that terrible. So I had to cheat a lot, spy here, jump then and now to check the places he would go and pray he didn't get killed while I wasn't watching him. I had to murder some nazis, put some ammo caches here and there and watch him become a hero.  
Luckily nobody recognized him because of his enormous beard and he wasn't really aware about his likeness with the other Hitler because he didn't had access to portraits, so when the moment was right I just walked straight to him and gave him a shaving razors and scissors and a note that said "Your father was Piotr Smziminski and you have a scar in your leg, so trust me when I say you must shave and cut your hair and be at the garden of the Reichskanzlei at 7" and walked away without talking to him.  
So basically he ran into himself when Hitler was about to sneak out to flee to Argentina and he got shot by himself. You can check my Youtube channel for the video where one hitler with a soviet uniform shots another exact Hitler like him. I did the diesel pit afterwards to keep the mystery for that timeline.  
Yes, that is much it.
