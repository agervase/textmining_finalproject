The children were distracted. There were some constructing paper planes and chatterboxes, others were less constructive even that, just staring blankly at the wall, which was blanketed by assorted empire timelines and pictures of world leaders. There was only one child, Lucy Young, who waited for me to continue. 

“What was next, sir?” 

I decided, selfishly, that I didn’t want to be the custodian of human history anymore. All my power, all the civilisations I have given birth and death to, all the men who have prayed to me, all the warriors who have whispered my name on their final breath, all of it has led to this. I stood in a small cramped room with smelly, snotty-nosed children, none of whom who could have cared less about what came before, or what would come. 

None, that is, except Lucy. 

“What would you like to have come next?” 

“I don’t think history works like that, sir”

“Well I wouldn’t think it would either, but it’s a simple enough question. After Caesar was killed, what would you have liked to see happen?”

“I think the senators should have been tried for their crimes, sir”

“A very mature answer, I must say, my dear. But, you do understand that Caesar was a tyrant, and his continued existence would have resulted in countless more deaths than were necessary?”

“I understand, sir, but that’s not important. Caesar was their leader, and they should have listened to him”

She certainly had promise. I found her conviction admirable for such a young mind, and morally she was upstanding. Besides all that, I didn’t really care who took the weight from my shoulders at that point. It had done me far more ill than good, and perhaps it was time for a new perspective for history. 

“Well, dear Lucy” I had whispered to her. “It all happened exactly how you like” 

And I was free.
