I woke up this morning with my head under the pillows. Unfortunately my pet was a little too loud for its shitty puns being shrieked across the backyard. 

By pet, I mean shark... and let's just say he isn't mine, but my ancestors. The only thing Great Uncle James was so "great" at was getting into trouble, and the one time he happened to get rich off of it, we all paid.

"Hey, if I gotta spend another night in your hot tub, it's your kid's mind to pay... Well, either way it will be but whatever. I mean, yeah, I may not live here, but yeah."

I mean, yeah, I've lived with Jarr'TÃ»l for almost twenty-four years now, since I was born. He's nothing new to me. But Jesus, he's so damn annoying. Appeared in my bath once.. creepy bastard. 

"What's up, Kal? Been about, oh, two hours. Getting kinda lonely... You up yet, buddy?"
"Yeah yeah, I'm coming. Don't bust your fins for anything around here." He really doesn't. I mean, yeah, he's always willing to do a crossword in the morning. That doesn't mean he's gotta wake me up all the time for it.

For a curse, Jar wasn't a bad guy. He's a shark, and to most that would be weird, but when you see him since you're born, and nobody else ever does... You don't have to worry. He won't eat me like other demons would. Well, he SAYS they would. I don't know. 

I moved to Memphis about three years back for college, and I missed Jar. Yeah, he's annoying, but he's a buddy. So I built a pool.

"Hey! Kal, buddy! C'mon, I may not be visible to your neighbors but they already think you're nuts. Whatcha got to lose, eh?"

"Coming, Jar." Always on my way for the guy. 
Now, to find that newspaper before he goes off his rocker.
