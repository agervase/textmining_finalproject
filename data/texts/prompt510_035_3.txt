Stunning, astonishing, truly fallen from heaven. There he was leaning on the wall in the streets, just admiring what's around him. He notices someone switch the way he's walking right in front of him and lets out an audible laugh.

I walk up to him a bit shaky, as I notice everyone around him is filled with disgust. "Hey!" I said to get his attention, he looks a bit surprised and replies with a simple "Hello!".

I don't know what to say.

"Pretty confused?" He says.

"Very"

"Why?" he asks, while a look of surprise appears on his face gradually.

"It's just the fact that everyone around you... I don't know, really."

"Hates me?"

"I mean... Ya, I guess."

"I'm surprised you mustered up the courage to talk to someone as frightening as myself." He laughs with a smirk.

"What?" I'm almost confused as a hawk learning how to swim.

"What do you mean, 'what'?"

"You're only one of the most attractive people I've seen my whole life!" I notice what I said, and can solidly say I have never felt this awkward in my life.

His eyes widen, his expression changes to that of pity, and he pats me on the shoulders.

"What terrible life have you lead?" As he looks on, seemingly increasing his pity towards me.

"W-What do you mean?" I say, it's like he knows about it.

"You see, everyone looks at me... differently"

"I don't really follow?" I'm beginning to question what I got myself into.

"Everyone looks at me how they perceive death. I know this is a bit sudden, but please follow. Usually that means a hideous being. Yet you, you see me as one of the most handsome being in this world?!"

"Is this a joke?!" I reply with a bit of anger here, and a bunch of sadness there.

I finally understood what people meant by the sweet embrace of death.
