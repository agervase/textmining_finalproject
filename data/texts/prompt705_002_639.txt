She dropped her keys and cursed. 

*Really?* I thought. **THIS** *is the one? How can she handle the world, if she can't even handle a pair of keys??*

Finally, she managed to get her keys in the door and went inside. Then the kitchen light came on. Then the fire alarm as she ran to the window and opened it wide to let the smoke out.

*Wow* I face palmed. *She can't even cook..*

Saturday, she went to the movies. The movie wasn't that bad actually. I liked it a bit.

◇◇◇◇◇

The Saturday after that, she went to a bookstore,  *straight to my favorite section*! I didn't even know she liked those type of books.

I kept one eye on her while I perused the shelves for a book or two, and found a book that was so good I stopped paying attention to her for just a moment. 

Next thing I know, she was tapping me on the shoulder and smiling. She nodded her head at the book I was reading. "Good one. Wait till you get to the middle part."

"What happened?"

She shook her head with a half-grin. "No spoilers."

*I hate when people do that.* But, for some reason, I didn't hate it as much as much this time. *Wow, she has nice eyes.*

I'm observing here up close. Sure, it seems like a date, but it's not. I'm on a mission. 

If it *was* a date would I have taken her to the carnival, bought her cotton candy, and walk hand in hand with her on the beach after?

Exactly. No. That's what I thought. It's not a date.

◇◇◇◇◇

We're getting married. So what? Sue me.

I'm only doing it because...because...

"Emma Keller, I love you. I'm *in* love with you, and I've been in love with you for longer than I wanted to admit. My world ended the day we met."

She began crying.

The pastor smiled. "You may now kiss the bride."
