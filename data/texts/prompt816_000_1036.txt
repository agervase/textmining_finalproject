John Lick stood at the top of the scaffolding, looking at the gangsters and thugs below him. He had taken out the guards outside, but he would not be able to keep himself hidden for long here. He would have to be quick.

Everything had led him to this place - all the death, the suffering, all the senseless slaughter. He had used just about all of his golden bones, but that meant nothing to him now. 

All that mattered was revenge. 

He lept from the platform, landing on an unsuspecting thug below. Lick immediately tore at his neck before he could react, and he sprinted towards the next gangster, biting his genitals before he reached his gun. The man cried out in shock, and Lick immediately sprinted for cover as the guards began firing at them both. 

"It's the dog!" the man that had killed his owner yelled, running for cover. "Kill that fucking dog!"

Lick jumped up onto the side of a wall, leaping off it and clamping shut on a guard's face. He twisted, tearing off half the man's face with the force of the pull. More men fired at him, but there were fewer left now. 

He showed no mercy, just as they had not. He hunted the men, pushing past his injuries, fueled by sheer vengeance. One by one they fell. 

As he bit out the throat of the final guard, the man that had killed his owner stumbled away. John Lick paced after him, cornering him.

The man began to speak, holding out a trembling hand. 

"*It was just a fuck'n-*"

Lick tore into his throat, ripping it out with brutal efficiency. The man fell wordlessly, the blood pooling around him as Lick left the building. Sirens blared in the distance.

John limped back to his home, his injuries finally catching up to him. 

He reached the grave of his owner, and circled once, twice, before laying down next to him. 

He shut his eyes, the weariness overcoming him. It would not be long now. 

But he would die happy.
