He felt the strength leaving him suddenly - he knew it was the necromantic sapping of being. He had failed, but... Still there was time, every necromancer understood the basics of reanimation. The freshly reanimated being required a connection to the soul of the original inhabitant (or some soul) in order to power it. He cast Magic Jar, praying for the first time since he was a child. To Kyuss, God of undeath, Decay, he who would spread the beauty of undeath to each corner of the prime material plain and revel as the flame of the souls powering the reanimated constructs slowly, one by one burnt out,  Cleansing this reality of the horrible chaos that is life. Kyuss, I will spread undeath far further as a necromancer than an undead myself, please help me?! He plead....

I heard him...

I rolled in my pocket dimension.

So seldom do I hear so plaintive, so desperate a cry from one of the living...

He needs a favor, and I may extract my price now...

I grant him the body he will transport his soul into, and the soul to power his old body.

A foolish paladin who had tried to come to my domain and slay me. An absolutely fitting punishment after three millennia of being fed upon by my worms? Perhaps not. But I have gained in this trade...


The necromancer felt cold.

He could not feel his hands or his legs, or any part of his "body". He had experimented with Magic Jar before, placing himself into small creatures, and occasionally into objects. But this did not feel like either.  Something was wrong.

The Necromancer attempted to cast Magic Jar again, but it failed. At least his being hadn't been consumed in undeath. But now madness did not seem like an unrealistic option.
