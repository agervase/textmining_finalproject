At the time it felt like a cruel joke. 

As soon as my index finger touched the inlay of plated steel I knew what I had. I was instantly reminded of what my father had done with it- what I'd likely do with it. I'd blow my brains out all over the Boston metro because the answer was now so clear, I didn't have to think anymore, an answer was gripped in my left hand. I was actually surprised how soon the bag gave it to me.

The bus smelled like fresh piss, and because I couldn't pull a car out of the bag, it was what my life was reduced to. The bag had a sense of humor- Bill to pay? Here's a pen, letter and stamp. I was happiest when there wasn't anything in it, around the holidays usually, when I had my kids and my dog and a beer. The bag was stasis, an eternal floor in my life that kept me just satisfied enough to keep going. I'd sit in church as a kid, after my father was gone, and keep putting my hand in expecting a radio to my dad, in hell, so I could tell him it's ok. No worries though, hell was this bus in absolute humidity. My shirt clung to me like I was dipped in latex.

"Move it asshole."

I sat down, my hand still on the gun. I thought about my kids, then my father. Over and over again, until the bus was outside of my apartment building. A crowd had gathered around the entrance all staring at the burning summer sky. I looked up as well, a man stood clinging to the iron railing on the windows.

"Give me a reason!"

"To jump? Or not to?" I shouted a response without thinking. The crowd's guffaws indicated I should have used a filter.

"That's fucked up man!"

I reached into the bag, still a gun. Still the memories of police tape.

"Do you have a kid?" I shouted at the sky again. The man began to sob and pulled himself close to the iron bars like a prisoner looking out of his cell.

"Don't do it." The man edged to the fire escape and collapsed in exhaustion on the grated platform.

I reached into the bag and felt nothing.
