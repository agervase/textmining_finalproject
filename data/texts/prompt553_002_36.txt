Beer.




It was good




Drunk, I was pretty sure I was drunk too.



Well, it was about time I got to sleep anyways. Drifting off to sleep on the crusty old couch, surrounded by bottles of beer and the sounds of sports commentators from the TV, I soon found myself in dream land.



When I awoke, it was to the thundering storm that was the lawnmower outside. Turns out, the neighbours didn’t realize that it was the weekend.





I would’ve screamed at them to stop, to yell at them to shut up and go die in a fire but today was a special day. The day, when my wife would come back to life.







Pawing at a bottle next to me, I gave a quick shake and was rewarded by the sounds of splashing liquid within. Bringing it to my lips, I drained the thing, ignoring the fact that the beer was lukewarm.




Stumbling out of the couch, a small cascade of glass flooded the ground beneath me and eventually I made my way to the basement where I would perform the ritual.





Before mid-day, I was dead.













I woke up on a crusty old couch, now devoid of beer bottles.






The TV I noted was turned off and on it was a sticky note.







-Would it kill you to clean up? I had to spend the entire day clearing up YOUR crap!-






I groaned at that and grabbed a pen before bringing it to a fresh sticky note.















-Sorry, my sports team was playing, couldn’t miss it.-











I went to work after that and after coming back home, I died again.














I woke up on that crusty old couch again and upon the TV saw another note.












-I want a divorce. The minister said until death do us part and I want out!-











Well that sucked.
