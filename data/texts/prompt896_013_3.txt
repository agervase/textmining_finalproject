My immediate thought was that this was one of Mrs. Embers' crappy "jokes". She was a tough old broad, not the type you would meet and assume she was a middle school librarian, anyway. Now, the DMV on the other hand...

What made me realize, after a moment, that this was more than an attempt to make an example of an obnoxious student was the fact that Embers casually sauntered away almost immediately after dropping the massive volume in front of me on the desk. A few seconds later I sneezed at the dust that flew up when she plopped it down. 

"Gesundheit!" I heard Mrs. Embers say, glancing at me over her shoulder as she was shuffling through some papers at desk positioned further in the back of her office, situated behind the library's front desk. 

As I began to mutter a "thank you", I was interrupted by an odd warning.
"That's German for God Bless You."

I started to feel like maybe somehow, some way, this old battle axe may have ACTUALLY  come to acquire a notorious, ancient text at some point in her many years as a generally despised librarian at a middle school in the idyllic suburbs of Pennsylvania??

My mind was racing. As the bell signified that it was time to gather our things and proceed to our next class, I hastily placed the mysterious  (and heavy) book into my Jansport as images fly through my mind of Mrs. Embers dressed in some Indiana Jones getup, clutching the Codex Gigis in one hand and and grasping a lasso with the other.

Two minutes later, as I'm entering the room for Mr. Brown's health class, I notice it. The book, heavy and smelling of dust, is radiating a strange, tingling heat through my bag and into the skin of my back.
