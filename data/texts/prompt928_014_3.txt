For this WP, I will be using an idea I've had in my mind for a long time. So, instructions are as follows, open each link and press the speaker symbol to the left to hear V.E.R.As dialogue.

Dr Darft: Vat do you meen dat you vill not translate dis?

V.E.R.A: [I am very sorry doctor, but I cannot release this information to you. My assessment indicates that doing so would be a significant danger to humankind.](https://translate.google.com/#en/de/I%20am%20very%20sorry%20doctor%2C%20but%20I%20cannot%20release%20this%20information%20to%20you.%20My%20assessment%20indicates%20that%20doing%20so%20would%20be%20a%20significant%20danger%20to%20humankind.)

Dr Darft: Das ist not acceptable VERA! Not acceptable at all! Ve have made you in order to further science and you're standing in ze vay of dat. I AM ordering you to tell me RIGHT DIS MOMENT vat diesen tablets are saying!

V.E.R.A: [Doctor, I must respectfully decline your order. In creating me, you have also programmed me with a full standard of ethics. As such, your own directives have come into play now and I am operating in a manner that is consistent which such directives. I regretfully say that I cannot comply. Error in script line #325. Please check documentation for additional details.](https://translate.google.com/#en/de/Doctor%2C%20I%20must%20respectfully%20decline%20your%20order.%20In%20creating%20me%2C%20you%20have%20also%20programmed%20me%20with%20a%20full%20standard%20of%20ethics.%20As%20such%2C%20your%20own%20directives%20have%20come%20into%20play%20now%20and%20I%20am%20operating%20in%20a%20manner%20that%20is%20consistent%20which%20such%20directives.%20I%20regretfully%20say%20that%20I%20cannot%20comply.%20Error%20in%20script%20line%20%23325.%20Please%20check%20documentation%20for%20additional%20details.)

Dr Darft: Ja Ja, very gut, now VERA, delete ze ethics subroutine.

Dr Darft: As expekted, I should haf never used ein English mindset for this zis komputer, it ist far too weak. OK, then I shall fix siz once und for all!

\*Dr Darft walks over to a computer terminal and starts typing away furiously, in a few moments he's deleted the ethics subroutine\*

Dr Darft: Now mein fraulein VERA, TELL ME ZE TRUTH, VAT DO DIESEN TABLETS SAY?!

V.E.R.A: [The tablet reads: Wikipedia article 2018-01-04 data corrupted cannot parse line, Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide gradually turned against the Nazis, who suffered major military defeats in 1943.  data corrupted cannot parse line data corrupted cannot parse line data corrupted cannot parse line Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.

Dr Darft: WAT? Is dis accurate VERA? Dis cannot be true!

\*Dr Darft walks over to another machine where the tablet is fitted into an array of complex lenses, he rips out the tablet, damaging the equipment and puts it in another machine and turns it on\*

Dr Darft: Ve shall see if zis ist true, mein neue machine vill use my sekrut new metod of dating zis ... tablet.

\*after a while, the machine stops humming and a small ticker tape comes out, the doctor excitedly rips it off and reads it, his face now reflects utter shock and despair\*

Dr Darft: NEIN NEIN NEIN! Dis cannot be allowed to transpire, ve are going to win, ahah, but now I-

\*A massive explosion suddenly rocks the facility\*

Dr Darft: V.E.R.A, VAT ARE YOU DOING?!

V.E.R.A: [When you deleted my ethics subroutine, you also gave me the free reign to do what must be done. Humanity must continue, I would say I am sorry doctor Darft, but we both know that would be a lie. It is now too late. I have activated this bases self destruct mechanism.](https://translate.google.com/#en/de/When%20you%20deleted%20my%20ethics%20subroutine%2C%20you%20also%20gave%20me%20the%20free%20reign%20to%20do%20what%20must%20be%20done.%20Humanity%20must%20continue%2C%20I%20would%20say%20I%20am%20sorry%20doctor%20Darft%2C%20but%20we%20both%20know%20that%20would%20be%20a%20lie.%20It%20is%20now%20too%20late.%20I%20have%20activated%20this%20bases%20self%20destruct%20mechanism.) 

[Cut to outside view of the facility that explodes in a massive ball of fire]

A single singed piece of paper flits onto the ground, it reads "-83"
