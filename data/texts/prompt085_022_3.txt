"Heya, what can I getcha?"  
The kid behind the counter was too cheery.  I don't like cheery people.  They're always loud, and memorable.  It gave me a headache.    
To be fair, I don't really like people.  That's why I took a job in web development, where I can work from home and only deal clients via email.  I rarely leave my own house more than once or twice a month.  Even my food is delivered to my doorstep, I don't even have to talk to the delivery guy.  
Which is what brought me here, to this bloody restaurant.  The weather's been shit and well.. neither rain nor sleet nor snow my ass.  My kitchen was bare and I was hungry.  Subway was the closest thing.  
"Chicken.. I guess.. whatever's fastest."  
I was probably ruder than I needed to be to the kid.  It wasn't his fault.  But I just wanted to get back to the calm safety of my own home.  I really didn't give a damn what kind of sandwich he made me.  The less I had to interact with others, the better.  
"What kind of bread do you want?"  
He asked me with the same cheery attitude, as if my attitude didn't bother him.  Or he didn't notice.  I don't understand how someone can be so happy to do shit work with so many people day in and day out.  People were problems.  
"What?"  
I wasn't really paying attention, I just wanted a damn sandwich!  The kid started rattling off a list of breads.  Why the hell do they have so many?  Who needs 8 kinds of bread?!  
"Italian.  Just please be....."  
I never finished the statement, which I guess is a good thing considering how mean I was being.  But it was unimportant as faces flashed before my eyes.  One after another, each one sick and dying.  I saw the moment of their death.  Or... what would have been their deaths.  
It felt like an eternity.  I know that's a cliche, but more than five, fucking, BILLION deaths were shown to me.  THIS is why I didn't like people.  When I interact with people, this happens.  Never so many, usually just the person I'm near and a few others.  But I see how they die.  Or rather, how they would have died.  But five billion?  I'm not sure how I even counted that high.  It went on and on until I thought I would break.  I'm honestly not sure I didn't.  
"Okay...sorry."  
For the kid, maybe a few seconds had past, if even that.  But he saw me pause and saw the tears rolling down my face to splatter on the linoleum.  He was kind, the only further words he said to me was the total of the bill.  I paid, snatched my sandwich and left as quickly as I could.  His sad smile followed me all the way home.

I could barely breath, each breath a weak rattling wheeze.  Each one made me shiver with pain, but that was nothing compared to the cough.  Though my limbs were weak and I found it nearly impossible to get out of bed since last night, the coughs would send me thrashing in agony. My head pounded, my stomach rebelled with a fervor and the only thing saving me from voiding in my bed was the fact I couldn't eat anything, at all.  
At first, I'd thought it a flu.  That Subway brat had sniffled, I thought, probably contaminating me with bacteria or virus that would pass in a few days.  That's what I get for going out in public.  It, NEVER turned out well for me.  I should have known better.  
I'd canceled my clients for the week, no way I could work like this.  The few friends I had were all people I'd met online and lived out of state.  One had even offered to fly in and take care of me.  I told him that was stupid, coming all the way here just to catch a flu from me.  
Now?  Now I wished he was here.  I can't get out of bed.  I can't see past the pain of my traitorous lungs.  The truth is I've never felt sick like this and I don't know what to do.  None of the meds in my closet have helped and the internet couldn't tell me what's wrong.  I've even turned to holistic medicine, with essential oils burning on my night stand.    
Another cough, a long one, sent me spasming, my movements wrapping me tighter the small mountain of bedspreads and sheets piled atop me.  Black dots colored my vision, more and more the longer the fit went on.  Finally it subsided and I gave a tiny sigh of relief, waiting patiently for my vision to clear.  
The darkness in my sight cleared faster than I expected, as it was replaced by a light far brighter than the late evening  or the oil burner should have provided.  In the pain filled haze I was in, it took me far longer to make sense of what had happened than I care to admit.  My movements had knocked over the essential oils and both my floor and bed clothes had caught fire!  
I struggled mightily against the cocoon of fabric I had wrapped myself in.  That is to say, I barely struggled at all as I find my limbs to feel as heavy as lead.  I managed to roll over once, but I couldn't tell if that helped or hindered my escape.  The fire crawled inexorably across the covers to me.  
Another coughing fit struck at the same time the flames began to lick at my body.   I'm still not sure which it was that killed me.
