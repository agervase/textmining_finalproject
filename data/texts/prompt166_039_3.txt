Rocketboy was different than other heroes. 
No not in the sense that he wasn't cliched, oh dear god was he beyond cliched! A starry-eyed goodie-two shoes who would run around in a bright red suit and lay down pun after pun whenever he can. Hell, the man calls himself Rocketboy and he can't even fly, he just likes the name and stuck with it. Maybe that's how I grew fond of him, he was never ashamed of his corniness and always gave it his best show regardless of whether his audience was over a thousand or just me. He wasn't like other heroes who were always so god damn broody and emotional like all the damn time. They were no fun to toy with and were always trying to compensate for the fact that most of them still ran around in embarrassing rubber suits.  

Whenever I faced him, he made me feel as if I was the only villain in the world, like my latest death-ray or bank robbery was of the upmost importance. His naive unbreakable goodness was something I felt needed to be protected from this world, I mean how can I let him face off against villains like Devilynn or Doctor Holocaust? They would break him! They would ruin the one decent superhero worth engaging in pun-battles with! So I dedicated my life to become his archnemesis and distract him day after day with the most silly and pointless crimes 

Sometimes I wondered if Rocketboy felt the same way about me, that perhaps he enjoy this little camaraderie as much as I do. Sometimes I could feel it in the way he says my name *"Atomizero"* or how he always *just* misses me with his punches. I don't know and I'm too scared to ask, both of him saying no and even more of him saying yes. Would getting with him mean I had to forgo crime? Would it mean he had to give up heroism? I wanted neither and was determined to keep our charade going as for as long as possible, sticking to the routine and code. 

The calendar shop was beyond tatters as pieces of burning paper drifted in the sunlight of the gaping holes in the ceiling. A corner of May 15th was stuck to my forehead as Rocketboy was busy handcuffing me to the *Hawaii Scenic Landscapes* catalog display rack. A crowd of passersby cheered from the streets as Rocketboy once again saved the little shop a mere $500 off its $20k worth of collateral damage. 

"Looks like today was a bad date to rob the calendary, Atomizero!" Rocketboy laughed triumphantly. 

"With you, every day feels like a bad date" I replied, not even faking my smile at the terrible humor. 

"Well if you're wanting a good date, you should have just asked..." 

I blinked twice at his remark but he just smiled and winked before he turned to address the bewildered clerk. 

The sound of glass crunching underfoot filled the air as someone pushed past the crowds and entered the store. He looked like an everyday nobody, just some punk wearing a black T and denim jeans, in a sour mood. Only I knew who he was and the danger that Rocketboy fallen into. His name was Dennis Ryker and we only call him that because he would kill anyone that try to give him an alias. Dennis wasn't your typical supervillain and never tried to be, his only driven goal in life is fight against each and every hero on this world. 

Only villains knew of him because every hero he faced, he killed. 

"Sorry sir, but it looks like this calendar shop is *booked* for the moment." Rocketboy said to the man who now was mere inches from his face. 

"Shut the hell up!" Dennis yelled as he slammed his fist into the side of Rocketboy's head. The only power that Rocketboy ever actually had was his super-durability. He used to tell me how he dreams of one day going into space and allowing himself to drift in the vacuum unprotected by a suit, that's why he called himself Rocketboy. He used to tell me how he took beatings for the bullied kids and waited until their victimizers grew tired before explaining to them their wrongdoings. He used to tell that the greatest strength in a man come not from what he can lift for himself but from the burdens he can carry for others. 

Dennis's punches were almost always fatal and could reduce concrete to ash. Rocketboy withstood the first two hits, but collapsed in a heap on the third.  

I didn't know what I was doing when I broke free of the cuffs. Facing Dennis was out of the question for a lowkey villain like myself yet here I was breaking every code as I charged forward. Luckily Dennis's back was turned and didn't see my approach nor did he see the phaser bullet aimed for his head.

It was dangerous to go out in your alter-ego so close to your rival, yet I couldn't help myself as I rushed into the hospital Rocketboy was being kept in. What the hell was I going to say to him? Was he even conscious? My heart was pounding and my knuckles grew white as I gripped the dollar-store flower bouquet with all my might. I enter his room, Rocketboy turned to face me with three black welts adoring his cheek, left eye, and temple, his breathing slow and painful. 

"Another fan to greet me, today must be my lucky day" he said hoarsely. 

"Does it hurt?" I stammered, "please be honest." 

 "Don't worry, I've been through worst battles... say, whatever happen to the man who did this number on me?"  

"He's dead. He'll never hurt you again." 

"That wasn't the right thing to do, Atomizero." 

His words were no longer playful, they stung. 

"Maybe you could teach me to do the right thing. Maybe I'll take you up on that date one day." 

"With you, every day feel like bad date." 

We both chuckled awkwardly. 

"You know I still have to arrest you, Atomizero. Murder, I can't let murder go." 

"I know." 

I leaned down to kiss him, he doesn't try to resist or push back. I could taste the blood on his lips and the tears dripping down from his cheeks. 

"But you'll have to catch me first."
