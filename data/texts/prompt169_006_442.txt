"See?" I said proudly, "Running the universe was easy as hell."

"Hmph," God grumbled, "that's, uh, impressive." He scratched his head and continued, "How'd you handle Universe #2389819743912? That place always gives me trouble."

"I-uh, what?" There was a universe 2389819743912?

"The universe with the pizzas that use chairs to order phones for dinner. The progress of causality to create that universe proved problematic in regards to morality and reasoning abilities. I-uh," God scratched his head again, "I couldn't really figure that place out. But, between you and me, could you tell me how you did it? I hope you understand this to be a secret between us."

"I didn't know there was a universe #2389819743912..."

"You..." God pushed me out of the way and looked at the Holy Dashboard. He groaned, "You only dealt with *your* universe!"

"I didn't know that there were more than one!" My face burned red.

"Of course there's more than one! Medammit, I gave you omniscience and you still didn't know? Oh, look, now there's interuniversal conflicts. Geez, I wonder who let those advanced civilisations abuse the glitches and bugs to do that? Reality's gonna come apart!"

"Well, what do we do?"

"We?"

"Yea..." 

He grimaced, "As much as I would love to ditch this whole fiasco, we're going to have to fix this. I'd rather not let the multiverse explode. And since the biggest problem is reality blowing up because of that interuniversal war, we'll have to handle that first." God walked off, grumbling about petty wars and leaders, and left me to mull.

He came back decked out in an orange jumpsuit with a pair of goggles strapped to his head. He held two big-ass sniper rifles in his hands. He tossed me one.

"Let's go assassinate some heads of state." He grinned.
