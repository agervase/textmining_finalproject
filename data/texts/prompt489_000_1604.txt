Arterius trudged through the snow to the Pizzeria Supreme.  Not for the first time, he wished that his uncle, the Snow Wizard, had not left Fargo for a job as a travelling weatherman / snowstorm slayer out East.  No one in his family was bound to the any of the cooking domains, certainly not Arterius, so it was just easier to head to any of the restaurants where the masters of their respective crafts had perfected pizza, rather than stumble through his own pathetic pizza attempt for an inferior result.

Whereas the larger cities of Omaha and Minneapolis seemed to have some recurring domains (and Gods help a metropolis like Chicago), Fargo seemed just the right size for minimal overlap.  Everyone had the own specialty, chosen by whatever domain had bonded with them in adolescence.  Sure, they had imported a few extra Fire Wizards from neighboring counties for the Department, but the homegrown, specialized Police Force had one of the highest success rates in the state.  The Wiring Wizard handled all the electricity issues Fargo had, and the various doctoring domains kept the city in relatively good health.  Arterius' mother was a Surgical Wizard of regional renown, and his father's work with a sewing machine made him a Cloth Wizard second to none.  Even his younger brother, Darius, had begun work as an apprentice as a Governing Wizard in Bismarck.  Everyone had their place in Fargo.  Everyone, that is, except Arterius.

&#x200B;

Arterius had gone longer than anyone in Fargo could remember without finding his domain.  His parents had even taken him to the State Domain Hall, complete with a large collection of items and tools meant to spark his domain to life.  Nothing.  He heard the whispers around town.  No-Domain, Domainless, No-main.  Gary, the Insult Wizard, was too kindhearted to help them find an actual good insult for him, but the growing pressure of not finding his calling weighed on him.

&#x200B;

Arterius rounded the corner to Pizza Supreme and groaned.  The restaurant's lights were out, and something was taped to the door.  He trudged over and read it in the faint light.  "*Wiring Wizard on vacation.  Should be up and running next week!*" Arterius grumbled and looked around.  He saw light wash out into the street from another store front two blocks down.  Was that the other pizza place in town, the new one?  He had heard mixed things about their wares.  The owner, a transplant from Grand Forks, wasn't a Pizza Wizard, but a Cheese Wizard with a dairy byproduct to die for.  It was just that the rest of the pizza didn't hold up to the delectable standards of Mary and the Pizza Supreme's specialty- just the Cheese.  Glancing up at the dark sky and continual snow, Arterius decided it was worth the risk and continued his trek a few more blocks.

&#x200B;

*Pizza A-More* wasn't the usual pizza place, on account of the owner's domain.  It was a dairy store by day, and moonlighted as a pizzeria come evening.  Arterius had never been inside- his cousin the Dairy Wizard provided cheese, milk and the like for the whole family.  It was well lit, and a single portly man sat inside behind a tall counter.  Seeing Arterius coming, he smiled widely and ushered him inside.  Despite Arterius' cantankerous mood, he jovially took the order and bustled to the back to begin his craft.  Arterius took a seat in one of the booths and glanced around the shop, bored.  And that's when he saw it.

&#x200B;

It was a shiny thing, maybe a foot wide and two feet deep.  It had four legs, and a main body with a slanted glass screen.  Lights flickered across its face, and various quiet sounds emitted from hidden speakers.  Characters from some movie plastered its side, and a screen near the top listed large, orange numbers and a few letters.  There was a thrumming in Arterius' chest, almost a vibration.  Entranced, he walked over to the machine.  Upon closer inspection, there were buttons on the side, which when pressed moved some levers behind the glass screen.  A plunger at the front didn't seem to do anything.  A message flashed on the screen:  "*$0.25 to Play!*"  Arterius fumbled in his pocket and procured a quarter.  He found the slot, and upon depositing a quarter, a small silver ball appeared on the plunger.  This time pulling the plunger shot the silver ball up and into the machine.

&#x200B;

It was a dizzy array of buzzers and bells.  The flashing lights were only a distraction, as Arterius moved the ball along the levers, off the bumpers, and the orange number at the top of the screen continued to climb.  He felt rooted in place, shifting only slightly to get a better view of where to send the ball next.  It wasn't really any question or decision, just a continual set of declarations of where the ball should go next, and the ball obeyed.  Occasionally the ball slipped beneath the levers, but enough points had been accrued that a new one would appear.

&#x200B;

All of the sudden, the machine locked up, and the ball slid once more past the levers.  Arterius snarled and glanced up.  The orange numbers were flashing, "*999,999,999,999*" and a blinking box appeared next to them.  He glanced around.  Sunlight was drifting through the store window.  Arterius' mother was there, surgical smock still on.  Tears streamed down her face, and she was smiling.  The Cheese Wizard was smiling too, a few extra pizzas out on the counter.  More of the family would be there soon, Arterius realized.  His family would be celebrating him coming into his own.

&#x200B;

He bumped one of the levers, and the letter A appeared.  Bumping it again changed it to a B.  Twenty five more bumps returned the A, and the other bumper made a 2nd A appear.  Smiling, he fiddled the bumpers until "ART" appeared on the screen.
