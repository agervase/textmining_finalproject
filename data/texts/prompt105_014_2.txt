*I killed a man...*

Police had arrived a few days later to ask me some questions. I’d never been involved in a serious crime before, and I always knew I was bad at lying, so I asked to speak to my lawyer first. They arrested me and took me down to the local station.

*I killed a man in cold blood...*

I told my lawyer that I did it, but never told her why. She explained how the system worked, said that I was guaranteed a few years in prison at least, maybe reduced for good behaviour.

*I killed a man in cold blood, and it was easy...*

Working as a nurse for years, I’d seen quite a variety of shades of blood, but nothing darker than a pomegranate — even in the most hardened criminals. But that man’s blood was pitch black. It wasn’t a medical condition, either. He was a convicted child trafficker, I’d seen his face in the news.

*I killed a man in cold blood, and it was easy. I am not remorseful...*

My wife and children will struggle without me, emotionally and financially. I worry about them constantly, trying to figure out what to do, how to escape my predicament. I ask my lawyer again if there’s anything that can help me against the mountain of evidence.

*I killed a man in cold blood, and it was easy. I am not remorseful, but I wish I could take it back...*

She tells me about an obscure law that’s been around since medieval times, a pardon that can only be granted by the church, and only under exceptional circumstances. She tells me that if I did commit the murder, there’s no way it would work out for me. I tell her I have no choice, and submit my formal request for High Appeal.

*I killed a man in cold blood, and it was easy. I am not remorseful, but I wish I could take I back. I will never do it again*

When they finally heard my case, it was months later. The appeal was the first of its kind in more than three hundred years. It dominated the news for 24 hours leading up to the hearing, due to both its obscurity and its grandeur. The head of the royal family, the head of church, and the highest judges were all part of the council. The proceedings were televised all over the world. At the end of the hearing, the final judgement was to draw some of my blood. The world gasped in unison.

*I killed a man in cold blood. It was easy. I am not remorseful. I would not take it back. I will kill again. **I will kill again***
