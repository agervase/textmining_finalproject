“Beggars can’t be choosers,” I mumble, tone heavy with self-recrimination.  “That’s what I said.”  

I stumble as I veer too sharply around a narrow corner, barely righting myself in time to dodge a stone tossed at my head. I sigh, or attempt to, a strangled gasp wrenching from my lungs instead, scorching my throat on its way out.  I have yet to master the art of nonchalance while under the threat of a most brutal and miserable death.  Talking to myself, however, is a habit so deeply ingrained I imagine I’ll carry it with me into the realm of the spirits, if that’s how this mess is destined to shake out. 

“Took the mystery bag quite happily,” I continue, positively wheezing.  “Like a fucking idiot.” 

My arm shakes as I bring it up to wipe at my dripping brow and the dust stinging my eyes, the pommel of the sword I hold scraping against my cheek on its way back down.  I don’t have the strength to carry it properly yet of its own volition it remains in my grip, glowing blood red and chuckling with malicious intent.  If I weren’t on the verge of collapse I’d find it rather ominous, as I’m sure I’ve heard the words “murder,” “death,” and “delightful dismemberment,” sprinkled between bursts of hearty, disturbing merriment, but I’m steadfastly ignoring that for the time being.

“Why” I moan, “did I do it?”

As if in response, I can feel my boots begin to tremble even more vigorously as I race further down the dark alleyway.  One lets out a tremulous cough.  

“Please, sir.  Faster, sir.” It's barely a whisper, but I can feel the odd sensation of its voice being carried breeze-like to swirl around my ear. If I had a free hand, I’d slap at it.

“Hurry,” whimpers the other. “They’ll catch us.”

“They’ll kill us,” they moan as one, and I feel my own spirits plummet in response. However, before I can wallow too deeply, another presence takes the opportunity to make its thoughts known.

“You,” my left hand drawls- or rather, the tome perched upon it, miraculously open despite the rough journey as I continue to flee my pursuers -“are a shoe. And so are you,” it remarks pointedly to my other foot.  “A rather ordinary pair of boots if not for your somewhat extraordinary ability to verbalize. It is unfortunate, then, that you have nothing worth saying,” it condescends with a nasty bite.  “If you can keep your useless opinions to yourselves, I’m sure you’ll have nothing to fear even if the worst were to befall us. In the simplest of terms, you’re utterly worthless.”

“I, on the other hand,” it preens, “am a remarkable feat of magic.  In the right hands I can evoke wonder, awe, or fear. I can summon demons and apparitions, beguile, obfuscate, or illuminate! Why, I can even raise armies of the dead!” 

A delighted giggle bursts from the sword at that, perhaps imagining the destruction of said armies. The spell book, seemingly unconcerned, carries on.

“I can work the elements, bring about the wildest riches, bestow clandestine knowledge, and much, much more... *I* am a miracle,” it boasts. There is a brief pause, as though it were contemplating. “The human... Well, who knows.”

The shouts of my- our? -pursuers sounds much louder and consequently much closer; they’re gaining on us.  “Thanks,” I grumble, only half paying attention.

“Don’t mention it.” 

The shield on my back chooses that moment to roar to life.

“COWARDS!” It bellows, all righteous fury. “INSOLENT WHELPS! GUTLESS, SPINELESS CRETINS! CHASE US DOWN, WILL YOU?”

“Crap, we set him off,” mutters the spell book.  “Any chance you have a cloak you can throw over him? No? Pity.”  

“YOU KNOW NOT WHO YOU CHALLENGE, NOR THE FUTILITY OF YOUR TASK! YOU DARE PRESUME THAT YOU CAN BYPASS OUR IMPENETRABLE DEFENSE, *MY* IMPENETRABLE DEFENSE? THAT I WOULD LET YOU TOUCH A HAIR ON MY MASTER’S HEAD, LET ALONE HARM HIM? I THINK NOT!”

Unlike myself, the shield seemingly has no need for breath, and continues to scream into the night with all the gracefulness of a foghorn.  

“HONOR-LESS CURS, VILE VAGRANTS,” it trumpets “BULLIES AND BRAGGARTS! YOUR EVERY MOVE SHALL BE MET WITH FRUSTRATION AND DENIAL, FOR WHEN YOU MOVE TO STRIKE I SHALL BE THERE TO BLOCK, PARRY, DEFLECT, AND DEFEND WITH THE CONVICTION OF THE VIRTUOUS! AND YOU SHALL KNOW A DEFEAT MOST READILY DESERVED!”

Of course, it was at that moment that I ran into a wall, quite literally, and our sheild’s proclamations of victory became precarious at best.
