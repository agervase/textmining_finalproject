"Well, what the fuck is that?" Said Beto Nascimento, captain of a dreadnought with the easily pronounceable name UNSS Ara√ßariguama. Beto was highest ranked officer among the ships inside the Starcraft Carrier UNSS Alexander the Great, second only to commanders Norris and Lee.

"Seems like Lizards to me" said Lee, half-joking.

"Suure, 'cause it's very normal to see hundreds of winged, fire-breathing lizards....IN SPACE" Replied Beto, sunny as always"

They were in a room with a dozen other captains staring at the images transmited by the outside cameras. In front of all of them, Fleet commander Norris quietly analyzed the situation.

The flagship of the United Nations 4th Joint Strike Fleet left a wormhole only to find themselves in the middle of the weirdest battle any human has ever saw: Humanoid warriors, mounted in giant dragons or what could be described only as a Griffon, fought mainly in close combat.

Eventually, however, the fight subsided, probably due to the everest-sized ship suddenly appearing in front of them. For them, it looked as if a Lovecraftian God suddenly appeared before them, with both sides quickly rounting into the nearby planet's orbit. Not exactly the ideal first contact.

After asking for directions to the human concil in Geneva, commander Norris initiated relations between the warring factions -known as Druchii and Asur-. Their societies were reminiscing of european renaissance architecture. It lacked almost all of modern human institutions: Hospitals, machinery, and spaceships were alien concepts to them, instead, Healers, magic and chaos portals were integral parts of their civilization. As such, it may seem unfathomable that the species had an empire spanning a hundred of solar systems, with a trillion lives under the so called Phoenix King.

And both contenders for the Phoenix Throne were baffled with the technocratic humans in their system. After conquering their homeworld and smiting rival empires in it, the Asur never seen any society that thrived without magic. And to achieve with machinery what their peers required hundreds of years of study to learn was maddening to them. How could a human dare to travel the stars at any age when their kind needed to trains for the whole lives to dare to try?

It was that thinking that joined Druchii and Asur into a united host, their countless worlds and trillions of sould would launch themselves against the blasphemous species that reminded so much of the enemies from their past.

"Well, i guess we did it, we managed to settle the relations between two alien nations" Lee Smirked

"Yeah, and they are coming right to us" Beto finished
