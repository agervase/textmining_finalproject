I was called a retard from birth , 'idiot' 'moron' were some of the compliments I received daily. I cried everyday , tears of sadness intermingling with the shame of loneliness. My parents couldn't do much about me and so they started hating me with a passion as soon as I gained a mind of my own.


People in my world were sophisticated, we gained energy from our mother star source , Sol. Many people including my very kind relatives called me a "forgettable throwback to a previous millennia" I apparently was less evolved than they were and was doing undignified acts that only primitive morons used to do, like inserting various objects in my mouth and chewing it.


I was quite infamous... On one fateful day , I was sitting with my parents in a sauna soaking up the heat and feeling my wounds from the continuous beatings and bullying warming up. I wished everyday to God to make it stop , which was another outdated concept apparently, but I believed in god ... Because without the concept of him , life was too painful and lonely.


Lost in my thoughts , I observed a tiny mossy growth on the floor. It was so beautiful and unique. Quite absentmindedly I plucked it out and placed in my mouth and a person near me let out a cough. Startled I almost swallows the moss ! It was stuck in my throat as I fell on the floor. 


Struggling to speak , I pointed to my throat. My parents and many patrons observed me on the floor and averted their gaze ! They were letting me die ?!! My gaze was blurring at their cold gazes as I was breathing my last, I cried out to God in my thoughts and suddenly something unusual happened.


I swallowed the damn thing ! But the thought barely left my mind when I felt a power wave surge through me. My mind was clear as I got up slowly, looked around at surprised faces in contempt as I punched the ground obliterating the area.


I walked out slowly as the dust settled ... I would be this worlds reckoning.
