Alright I have two. 

At first we thought that aliens where invading. Or that the world was ending. The sun disappeared and even though there wasn't a cloud in the sky there where no stars. Then I realized why that shape was so familiar, it was a like a mouse pointer, the same one I spend most of my time looking at everyday, during work and at home. Then the whole world heard it. The "Click" clouds vanished water flooded land a wind strong enough to blow a small person away struck a few moments later. Then the drop down box appeared, even larger. 
As it moved towards "Create shortcut" I wondered what would happen, even though I knew what it was inevitably aiming for, I wondered what the properties menu would like, what the file size of our world must be. What options there are. 
And then, another click, and before anyone knew it, the earth had been deleted.

I hate my life, I hate my wife, I hate my house. I was sitting on my computer, bored, I had a headache for the ages and could hardly think straight, I could see her reflection in my monitor. I moved the cursor over her reflection, right click, delete. And my some godly fiat, she was gone, just like that. After the shock wore off, I angled my desk lamp to reflect my face more clearly. I didn't care how, or why, just that it worked. So I right clicked myself and selected "Delete". And... nothing happened... only there she was again. "Where'd you go! What the fuck?! I swear to god if you scare me like that again, I'll give you something to be afraid of! I will never let you hear the end of it." I ignored her. I did it again. 
Silence, sweet blissful silence. Well if this is the best I can do, it's good enough, I'll have to try it again the next time my mom comes over...
