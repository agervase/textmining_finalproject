Dale woke in a dark and dusty room. His mouth was dry and he couldn't remember how he got here. He could remember his life. His wife, his kid his friends in the alley and all the great times they spent in the lazy Texas afternoons. He rubbed his head as he moved toward the bright archway at the far side of this dark cave. "Cave" he thought "how the hell did I get into a cave..." "I need a smoke" he mumbled as he searched for his pack. A sudden panic came over him "WHERE ARE MY SMOKES" he exclaimed as he stepped into the light. It was a blinding and dazzling whiteness that took his vision for a moment. As his eyes adjusted he could see the brightness, feel the brightness emanating from a figure on a throne at the end of, of this arena? "Why am I in an arena" he thought as he looked around at the silent and somber crowds packed into the stands. Some were breathtakingly beautiful while others were the stuff of his deepest nightmares. All were focused on him with a cold indifference. They were not here for fun or taking any enjoyment from it. It was more like a job. Dale was reminded of the exterminator convention in Tuscaloosa that he attended. The people in their overalls that didn't care about anything but death. The people who were so desensitized by killing they spoke of it with indifference. It wasn't a desire, it wasn't fun it was a job like any other. For Dale it was different. He was full of passion for life and his work.
He look to the figure on the throne, not man not woman but both and neither at the same time. "Weird" he muttered under his breath. A voice erupted around him, even though it had no origin "DALE YOU HAVE LIVED A LIFE PAID FOR BY THE DEATH OF MY CREATIONS.THE LIVES YOU HAVE TAKEN HAVE BEEN MARKED, THIS IS YOUR JUDGEMENT."
"Huh, no shit" Dale stated "What are we getting into?" he asked the presence.
"WE WILL GIVE A CHANCE FOR REDEMTION THROUGH BLOOD, YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF THE ENEMY OF THOSE WHO CRAWL,SLITHER AND SLINK. THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPERTUNITY AGAINST YOU"
"YOU WILL BE AFFORDED THE SAME WEAPONS AS IN LIFE"
THOSE WHO SURVIVE WILL GO TO ETERNAL BLISS AND THOSE WHO FAIL SHALL BURN"
Dale felt the familiar weight of his sprayer materialize on his back, he could tell from the weight it was full. A smile crept to his face as he saw the millions of little eyes in the entrance across from him. He looked to the being with one thought on his mind and a swelling joy in his heart. Reaching back he grasped his trust sprayer wand and asked "before we start, could I bum a smoke?"
