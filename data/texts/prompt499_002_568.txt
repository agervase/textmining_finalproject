**7:77 AM**

**On a Tuesday**



*FOUR men sit across the desk from ONE woman. The room is bathed in white light. Soft, diegetic music is playing.*



CHARLIE: WHOA. 



DENNIS: Right? And that's not even the worst part! No, no, buddy. After THAT, she goes all legalistic on me, you know? Like I'm a man she can feel unsafe around. Unsafe, hmph. I slew her sensuality, and made it mine own.



CHARLIE: Yeah, man, that's crazy, crazy, with all your weird stuff or whatever... but, like... where... are we? 



DENNIS: No, no, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, it's not weird stuff. I mean, it's not sex stuff, okay guys? You'll back me up if I go to court? Charlie? Buddy?

MAC: I am confused by everything that is happening right now.

FRANK: We ain't in a loony box, are we? I ain't goin' back. I'm packing. You can't make me go back.

MICHELLE: Hello.

DENNIS: WHOA, WHOA!

MAC: HEY, HEY!

CHARLIE: ?

*FRANK pulls out his gun, aiming at MICHELLE, across the desk.*

FRANK: Who the hell are you?

MICHELLE: Frank, put down the gun. You can't hurt me with it.

FRANK: Wanna bet?

*FRANK fires 3 rounds, striking MICHELLE once in the chest. She falls to the floor, dead.*

MAC: HOLY SHIT, FRANK! YOU JUST KILLED THAT WOMAN!

FRANK: She was askin' for it. You all saw! She was gonna jump me!

DENNIS: How could you ever reach that conclusion? She was sitting down!

*FRANK grumbles incoherently and begins to reload. ALL stare at him.*

FRANK: What?

DENNIS: ...It was because she was black, wasn't it?

*FRANK starts to shake his head, but slowly stops.*

FRANK: No, no... I ain't-

MICHELLE: Hello.

DENNIS: HEY, HEY!

MAC: WHOA, WHOA!

CHARLIE: ?

*FRANK fires a further 4 times, but all seemingly miss MICHELLE, standing behind her desk chair totally healed.*

MICHELLE: Nice. 

DENNIS: Jesus, Frank! Stop killing her!

*FRANK looks around frantically before jamming his gun into his trousers, grumbling again.*

FRANK: No promises.

*MICHELLE sits down, clasping her hands together.*

MICHELLE: Okay. That's never happened to me before. My name is Michelle.

FRANK: Bein' shot ain't so bad. You're fine, see?

MICHELLE (ignoring FRANK): You're dead. All of you.

*ALL turn to look at MICHELLE, mouths agape. Dennis begins to tear up.*

MICHELLE: Ah, no. Just wanted to get your attention. You're not. You're in The Bardo. 

CHARLIE: Barn? There are no barn in Philly!

MAC: Charlie, no. Relax, man. It's like...

CHARLIE: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A BARN IN PHILLY, MAC? HAVE YOU?!

*CHARLIE grips the desk, staring wide eyes, head cocked at MICHELLE.*

CHARLIE: ...Are we in Philly, Miss Shell?

MICHELLE: Well... sort of. You're where Philadelphia would be if the entire map was flipped upside down, turned inside out, and moved into the sixth dimension. 

CHARLIE: Oh, man. Phew.

MICHELLE: And you're not in a barn, Charlie. You're in The Bardo.

*CHARLIE looks puzzled.*

MICHELLE: Like Limbo. The place in between.

CHARLIE: Well I guess that's why there aren't any cute lil' animals runnin' around. Hey, where's the stick anyways? I could go for some limbo.

MICHELLE: Wow. 

MAC: Yeah, we know.

**The Gang Goes to Hell: Part Three**

-----

MICHELLE: Mr. McDonald, Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Kelly. Please, this will go much more easily if you listen to me.

DENNIS: Well, I don't make a habit of it. I don't know if I want to.

CHARLIE: Don't make a habit of what, dude? Listening to anyone? We know.

FRANK: Nice.

*FRANK and CHARLIE high five with their stomachs.*

DENNIS (puzzling at Charlie): Moving on. No, no. I don't listen to, well, people like her. 

*ALL stare at DENNIS, then MICHELLE.*

MICHELLE: I'm going to cut you off right now, Mr. Reynolds.

*ALL slowly turn to stare at DENNIS. MAC looks afraid. DENNIS swallows.*

DENNIS (softly): Say you what, woman? 

MICHELLE: Mr. Reynolds. Dennis. If you don't calm down I am going to restrain you.

DENNIS: Restrain me? Oh, okay. I get it. You're trying to implicate me. I will not submit.

CHARLIE & MAC: Ooooooh.

*MICHELLE snaps her fingers. DENNIS is instantly restrained by the chair, which also gags him. THE GANG are horrified.*

MICHELLE rises, slamming her hands on the desk. 

MICHELLE: OKAY. Listen up, shut up. You are all irrefragably vile individuals, morally speaking. I despise you all on a basic level, and I'm sure you all want to be somewhere else just as much as I do.

ALL (nodding): Yes.

MICHELLE: Good. You're all here because of Mr. McDonald.

MAC: Whoa, whoa. I don't know what this broad is talking about.

MICHELLE: You prayed for their souls, Mac. It works. God liked what he heard, so he decided to give you and your gang another chance. 

MAC (hooting, karate chopping): YES! GOD, BITCHES! I KNEW IT! SUCK ON THAT, SCIENCE!

MICELLE: Science is still real.

MAC: ...Oh. 

MICHELLE: To get back to the point...

CHARLIE: Is law real?

MICHELLE: Natural law is. Thomas Aquinas. 

CHARLIE (fist pumping): Haha, choo, choo, huh? Love it. 

FRANK: Jesus Christ, Charlie.

MICHELLE: Alright, that's it. 

*THE GANG are restrained by their chairs and gagged.*

MICHELLE: Now listen, will you?

*THE GANG nod.*

MICHELLE: You've all been going down some rather... dark paths recently. Even compared to your previous behaviour it is undeniably depraved. 

*THE GANG exchange sceptical looks before shrugging and nodding sheepishly.*

MICHELLE: Good. You do have some self-awareness. 

*A SONIFEROUS FART rips through the room. ALL turn to stare at FRANK.*

MICHELLE (gesturing): Ugh! Meat-bags! I am going to say this only once, so listen!

MICHELLE: I am an afterlife lawyer! That means I help ensure people that their conduct will get them into Heaven. You, at the moment, are all going to Hell. Mac has given you a second chance through prayer. I will be going over life plans with all of you, together, because you never, ever, seem to be apart. These life plans will ensure your entry into Heaven.

MICHELLE (staring intently): Do you understand?

*THE GANG nod.* 

MICHELLE: Okay. I'm going to let you go now.

THE GANG are unbound, ungagged, and begin to choke, save MAC.

DENNIS: That went down my throat, harlot!

MICHELLE: If I hear another word from you I'll do it again, Mr. Reynolds. 

*DENNIS begins to shake, but sits back in his chair. Veins pop in his forehead.*

MICHELLE: Good. Are you all ready to begin?

*THE GANG, save DENNIS, exchange looks, then nod.*

MAC: One question, though, if that's okay, your holiness?

MICHELLE: You don't need to call me that; I'm more of a bureaucrat. But, yeah. Shoot.

MAC: Where is Dee?

FRANK: Oh yeah. Where is that bird?

*THE GANG begin to laugh heartily, making bird noises and flapping their arms.*

MICHELLE: Deandra Reynolds, as you have all made clear on many occasions, is not a member of your gang.

THE GANG: Ooooooohhh.

CHARLIE: Yeah, that makes sense.

MICHELLE: She can be brought here. Her soul can be saved. All you need to do is say that she's a member.

*THE GANG groan, exchanging looks.*

CHARLIE: Yeah... here's the thing...

MAC: She isn't a member of the gang.

MICHELLE: Are you sure? 

FRANK: Pass?

THE GANG (echoing): Pass.

MICHELLE: Okay, then. Deandra Reynolds is going to Hell. This isn't a great start, guys.

*MAC and DENNIS high five.*

The Gang Goes to Hell: Part Three: Part Two? I've never written fanfiction, but I'll write more if people would like to read it. I know I deviated from the prompt a bit, but the idea of the Gang coming up against something omnipotent is fun to play with.
