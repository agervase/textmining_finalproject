Mankind isn’t clear on how exactly life started,

Whether RNA or clay or maybe God just farted,

But one way or another structures started to divide

And evolved into cells, making proteins and peptides,

Stagnated for a while in a prokaryote age,

Til a bacterium got got by a bacteriophage,

And BAM!—

Powerhouse of the cell, a mitochondrion became the first true organelle,

When that shit started dividing was when shit got more exciting,

The extra ATP made eukaryotes a lot more inviting,

More organelles joined the team, which got life starting to roll,

Because the parts on their own accomplished less than the whole,

Then multicellular life had an explosion in the Cambrian,

Weird shit that makes a sea squirt look like pretty much our next of kin,

But all this time the party was just under the sea,

And like the Little Mermaid some of these things longed to be free,

So came terrestrial life, which is a notable distinction,

But fast forward a couple billion years and a few mass extinctions,

The KT impact cleared the stage and then along came us,

Or rather our grandma Lucy, Australopithecus,

And a bunch of other hominins with brains on the order

Of mollusks—or your average Trump supporter

But they walked on two legs and that left their hands free

To jack off and make tools and fire and pottery,

And our brain size increased as tool use became key,

And humans spread across the continents and even the seas,

We mostly gathered and hunted and killed everything we found,

And wiped out pretty much everything over 100 pounds,

But what we didn’t kill off, we sometimes found ways to train—

Such as herding goats and cultivating cereal grain,

Which let us build up towns and fight our territorial wars,

Installing monarchs who spent lives to settle meaningless scores,

And for a while Asia looked like it would come out on top,

But homogeneity and stability ground all that to a stop,

And only Europe had the kind of geographic division

And resources to improve their tech through factional competition,

So the past few hundred years have been a colonial age

Which is ending as we globalize the world stage,

But for now Europeans are still pretty much on top,

From finance to politics and even sometimes hip-hop,

The underclass and third world are still striving for parity

While Moore's law marches us toward a sentient singularity,

So that's where we're at and how we got to this point, too,

I hope our cultural shortfalls don't disappoint you,

There's too much fear and suffering, here, and outright depravity,

But we're just monkeys hammered on the anvil of Earth's gravity,

And if you want to destroy us, well, we couldn't escape,

But as the falling angel meets the rising ape,

Perhaps there's room for growth and change and cosmic interplay,

And if you want a better lesson, next time, talk to Dr. Dre.
