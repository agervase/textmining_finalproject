(I hope this is good enough).     

You can usually tell when I'm in the area if a peculiar smell wafts into the room during curfew. It smells of cooked steak or chicken, and while under normal circumstances it would seem like a delicacy, to them it's a smell of death. They know all about me, and yet they know nothing about me. They make me out to be a bloodthirsty monster.       

...they're technically right, but just because I'm PHYSICALLY a bloodthirsty monster, that doesn't mean I'm not a nice guy. In fact, if you hear a pitter patter outside of your home, I'm probably just helping your pet inside. Or I might be having a snack on a squirrel or a bird. It's a shame, but them's the breaks.       

In fact, if you do smell my aroma in the area, it's a sign that I'm not out looking for food, and you shouldn't be afraid to come out. Not that you should anyway, since I dislike eating humans. Human blood is too salty, and I've only ever eaten from a few dozen in self defense. No, after I've had my dinner I look around for petty criminals that take advantage of my curfew to loot the innocent of their livelihoods. Best case scenario I scare them silly and leave them for the authorities. Worst case scenario if I'm attacked, it's suppertime. When the morning sun arrives, I have an hour to vanish back to a warehouse to rest until nightfall comes again.        

With all that said, I do not think you should fear me, but with the power I possess you have every right to. But if you do find me in your home, do not be afraid. Strike up a friendly conversation. Talk to me. I will listen. Just...don't offer me a glass of holy water.
