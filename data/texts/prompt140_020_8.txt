\[Oh man my first one of these and it got long. I hope someone reads it!\]

Sally entered the room, pulled her cleaning cart through and kicked the door shut.  It was unexpectedly bright, with some unseen light source - both diffuse and golden - giving the place something of the air of a cathedral. The walls were fifty feet high and covered floor-to-ceiling in shelves. An impossibly tall wheeled library ladder rested demurely in one corner.

&#x200B;

Really though the thing that grabbed Sally’s attention was the hourglasses. Every surface in the room was covered in them. Small ones, large ones, old ones, pretty ones, a few that looked like they had survived a fire and some where the glass had clouded so much that it was hard to see the grains at all.  Sally saw a beautifully ornate mahogany hourglass next to a tiny pewter one with maybe enough sand to time a boiled egg sitting beside the plastic sort you might find in a child’s chemistry set.   There was a huge wooden desk at one end of the room covered in hourglasses all stacked on top of each other into precarious towers. The clutter was extremely upsetting. The hourglasses on the shelves were at least placed neatly, albeit without regard to any sort of cataloguing system. Large areas of floor were obscured by yet more hourglasses.

&#x200B;

Worse, it looked like every single hourglass in the room needed dusting. Honestly the floor looked like it could do with being mopped too.  It was enough to make Sally itch.

&#x200B;

Sally took a deep breath, sneezed, and parked her cleaning cart in a relatively hourglass-free patch of floor. She grabbed a cloth and some shine spray and picked her way further into the room. As she approached the desk she realised that there was a someone sprawled across an enormous green wingback chair. A skinny teenage girl with short blue black hair regarded Sally curiously.

&#x200B;

“I wasn’t expecting anyone today, ” the girl said. “Have they finally sent me an assistant?”

&#x200B;

Sally held up her spray bottle and dust cloth. “No, sorry, just here to clean.”

&#x200B;

The girl raised an eyebrow. “You want to clean that?” Gesturing expressively at the room. “All of it?”

&#x200B;

“I mean, I’m not delighted about it,” Sally admitted.

&#x200B;

“Ok. Catch.” The girl grinned and threw a hourglass at Sally’s face.

&#x200B;

Sally dropped her spray bottle and clutched blindly at the air in front of her, managing by some miracle to grab onto the hourglass. It was made entirely of glass, the stand ribboned with venetian lamp work and for all it’s weight it was a fragile looking thing. Sally placed it carefully on the dusty table and turned angrily to the girl. Who was now a chubby blonde with cute bangs and sparkling eyes.

&#x200B;

“Nice catch. I’m Dee Dee by the way.”

&#x200B;

Sally glared. “Why did you do that?”

&#x200B;

“Good reflexes are important in this job. You’ve put that down upside down by the way.”

&#x200B;

“Shit, really?” Heart lurching, Sally quickly turned the hourglass over. “That didn’t, um, mess things up for anyone did it?”

&#x200B;

“Nah, that’s not how it works,” Dee Dee said. “Look.”

&#x200B;

Picking up the hourglass, Dee Dee gave it an experimental shake. The sand however continued to fall in a straight line. She turned it over. The sand fell straight upwards.

&#x200B;

“Oh, OK. The sand only flows one way.” Sally said, relieved.

&#x200B;

“No, not quite, look again.” Dee Dee said, tucking a strand of long red hair behind her ear.

&#x200B;

Peering closer, Sally saw that although most of the grains were falling straight down, every few seconds there were a couple of grains that seemed to defy gravity, drifting upwards into the upper bulb of the hourglass.

&#x200B;

“Here, look at this one,” Dee Dee said, plonking a sturdy metal hourglass in front of Sally.  “Wait for it… and there we go!”

&#x200B;

As Sally watched, the steady stream of sand falling into the lower bulb slowed and then the flow abruptly reversed for a few seconds, making it look like the upper bulb of the hourglass was sucking sand up from the lower one.

&#x200B;

“Why did that happen?” Sally asked.

&#x200B;

“Could be caused by lots of things,” Dee Dee smiled. “But in this case? Liver transplant.”

&#x200B;

Sally looked more closely at Dee Dee. The girl was about a foot taller now with almond shaped eyes and curly hair.  Although she had been wearing ripped jeans when Sally first noticed her, Dee Dee was now in a floaty sundress and worn sneakers.  At least her clothes were clean, Sally thought. She wondered uncharitably why the same magic that was behind Dee Dee’s rapid outfit changes, didn’t extend to keeping the room in better order.

&#x200B;

“The sands are a living reflection of a life. You see…”  Dee Dee stepped out from behind the desk and peered at Sally’s name tag. “…Sally Brown, any choice you make either extends your life or shortens it. There are choices to be made right up until the last grain falls.”

&#x200B;

“I suppose you have one of those things in here for me?” Sally asked.

&#x200B;

“Of course,” Dee Dee smiled, a slender tan arm gesturing to the cluttered room. “It’ll be somewhere in here. I’ve got over seven billion of the things.”

&#x200B;

“How are you doing that by the way?” Sally asked. “I haven’t seen you look the same way twice. Even your clothes keep changing. It’s unsettling.”

&#x200B;

Dee Dee shrugged. “When I took the job, they asked me me how I wanted to embody the concept of Death. I said ‘teenage girl’. Apparently that was interpreted as all teenage girls.”

&#x200B;

“So what were you before you were a teenage girl?” Sally asked.
