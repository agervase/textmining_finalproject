I stared long and hard at the string of letters on the sign below the painting. I could have just pointed and said 'That one', but I was feeling stubborn.

"Pi-jarter-id?"

The attendant smiled piteously at me. "No, no. It's a soft J, like a y. and the 'Ä' is short, like in hat."

"Pyattered"

"Nearly there. Try imagining saying it with an accent, you'd be surprised how much it helps."

"Pjätteryd?"

"Excellent sir! Why don't you try it a few more times? Just to make sure." The attendant's smiled was more genuine now, but there was something in the way he stared that was making me uncomfortable.

"Pjätteryd. Pjätteryd. Pjätteryd."


You had to give Ikea some credit, most places used obviously synthetic air fresheners, but the smell of pine hung heavy in the air in a way I hadn't noticed earlier. Rich. Earthy. It made you feel like you were in a forest. Somewhere in the ceiling, speakers played bird-calls. Cute touch, but a little mu- Where did the painting go?

What had previously been a silver geometric painting of a deer, instead hung black in its frame. A black that seemed to stretch endlessly, filling your vision until that darkness was all you could see. I tore my focus away from the drawing to ask the attendant if he was seeing this too, until I saw him.

"Whuh?"

"**Oh. You've lost it again. It's pronounced 'What.'**"

The attendant smiled piteously at me again. Gnarled, twisting  antlers were growing forth from his forehead like the roots of an upside-down tree. 

Perhaps I should've run, perhaps I should've screamed; but 15 minutes of trying to pronounce 'Pjätteryd' correctly had created some stubborn pronunciation response in my brain.

"What?"

""**Better. I am Pjätteryd, Hunter in the Infinite Wood, the horror that shook mankind so profoundly that to this day you cling to your cities for safety. I am the primal wild before and after civilisation. I am the end to the age of mankind.**"

"I'm Steve."

"**Steve.**"

I nodded. His antlers had woven themselves into a small canopy at this point, tearing apart the ceiling tiles. 

"How did you get stuck in a painting?"

"**Foolish mortals thought to bind me. Had me read a parchment, with my own name thrice repeated backwards.**"

"Dire-etta-jip?"

The once-attendant growled in annoyance. "**We covered this. It's a soft 'J'. Like a Y. Dyrettäjp**"

"Dilettayap?"

"**Dyrettäjp!**"

"Jirettanap?"

Its eyes flashed in anger. I heard the sound of wood splintering. Howls from a direction I couldn't pick. The distant rumbling of thunder.
"**DYRETTÄJP**"

I smiled. The anger drained from the not-attendant's face, replaced by confused horror. I turned back to the silver geometric painting of the deer on the wall. Broken ceiling tiles clattered to the floor. A quiet voice spoke up behind me.

"I'll give it to you at staff price if you don't tell my manager about this."
