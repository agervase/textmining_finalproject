"Holy shit, the cat's tail just came off."

"What do you mean th ... holy shit. I don't think that's supposed to happen to cats."

"What do I do? I'm freaking out, man!"

"I don't fucking know. Put it back on!"

"OK, hold on. Wait, there's a USB cord. There's a USB cord in the ass of the cat."

"There is *not* a USB cord in the ass of the cat. Well fuck me there there's a USB cord in the ass of the cat. Plug it in to your laptop."

"You want me to plug the cat in to the laptop?"

"Why not?"

"Dude, I've got pictures of dogs and stuff on there."

"How many pictures of dogs do you have?"

"I've got like 12 folders full of cool dog pictures."

"12 folders?"

"Possibly more, I don't know. 

"That's insane, Steve."

"I really like dogs. Do you think the cat will be mad?"

"The cat with a USB cord for an ass? I don't think so."

OK, screw it, let's plug him in." Steve took the now immobilized cat and connected it to the laptop. "The cat is updating."

"What?"

"The cat is updating. It's updating to version 256.3 or something."

"I've never once seen a cat update and I've petted a lot of cats."

"You're so good at petting cats."

"Sometimes I pet cats and I'm not even aware I'm doing it. I just look down and there's a cat there being petted."

"What do you think this update is going to do?"

"I don't know but I'm pretty sure it's going to change the cat world forever."

The door to the apartment opened slowly. A large man dressed in a black suit entered and gazed towards the the two men.

"Are you here for the cyber cat?"

"We know the secrets of the cats, man! We're going to tell the world."

"OK, so, just how much acid have you two taken today and what the fuck are you doing to that hoover?"
