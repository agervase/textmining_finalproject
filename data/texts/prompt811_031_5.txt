My horns crackle with the energy of another incoming summoning, drawing a sulfur-laden sigh from my lungs. By far the worst part of the job, answering to the beck and call of every young fool with a god complex, or the Machiavellian schemes of some businessman, looking for any edge on his own kind. Occasionally the cults, with their odd masks and half interpreted lore of demons. Always set my teeth on edge, they always sacrifice a goat and offer it proudly, like it's some form of trophy. I like goats.

&#x200B;

My talon-ed feet slice across the crimson sands of Hell as I venture to the summoning portal. See, this was the part they always got wrong about hell. It isn't a cavern, full of flame and brimstone. Hell is a desolate place, an endless desert under a gray sky. Demons do not torture, there's hardly a point, and the younger of us sympathize. We simply let the souls wander until they collapse under the weight of their own consciousness, and the sand makes them one of us.

&#x200B;

I gaze at the portal, already crackling with the energy needed to cross the gate, coalescing into a wobbling purple mass with my presence. I take a deep breath, and press myself through the arcane barrier...

&#x200B;

...And am blinded, my senses flaring as they desperately try to detect the threat. I bear my claws with a snarl, ears twitching. Priest? Priests? An exorcist? Demonic eyes agonize at pure souls, but as they acclimatize, I see the smallest priest I have ever seen at my feet, eyes wide as dinner plates.

&#x200B;

No, no, not a priest. A child. Old instincts kick in, claws retracting as my mind races. I gaze around the room, not cavernous in the slightest, only barely large enough for me, but see no hooded figures, no grinning mortals, no-one else who could be responsible. Just a frightened child with dirty golden hair and a tattered dress, in a room of empty bottles and food clad with the stench of rot. This should not be, can not be. I kneel down to the tiny mortal with the slow movement of an ancient body, and lock eyes with it, and suddenly all makes sense. No soul this young should be capable of a summoning ritual. Summoning requires pain, loss, a weighty agony in the soul itself, and the ruby heart within me breaks as I see how steeped this child is in all of them, and yet still incandescent to evil eyes with love.  The violence of a trusted man, the undue rage, and, with a deep feeling of revulsion I see, the lust. Her eyes brim with tears, and she whispers in a trembling voice.

&#x200B;

"Please. Take me away from here."

&#x200B;

I ache at the words I must say, that I cannot, that a soul so pure does not belong below, but I am never given the chance, as a bellowing and belligerent voice cries out from above, the thumping of someone descending the stairs. The girl turns away from me, as tears begin to flow at the sound. The owner of the voice rounds the corner, and I understand what could make a child turn their back on a demon. The face she fears, still clutching a bottle, which tumbles from his fingers as he sees me, and I see him. I see himself, as a child, weeping beneath another aggressive father, turning to the comfort of his forgotten bottles in the depths of night, but embracing sin and growing a taste for it. A taste for the pain of those weaker than himself, and I feel my skin mold in the magic of illusion, shaping myself to what he fears most.

&#x200B;

"Adam, you constant disappointment."

&#x200B;

His eyes widen, pupils dilating to nothing but pinslits as he backs away.

"I killed you. I killed you, HOW ARE YOU HERE?!" He cries, scrambling backwards.

&#x200B;

"You're why your whore of a mother left us Adam." I utter in another man's voice, a voice fueled by my own rage, slowly advancing.

&#x200B;

He reaches for his waist, and draws out a gun with the shaking hand of an alcoholic facing his own nightmare, but his terror betrays him and he stumbles, firing.

&#x200B;

A shot that misses me entirely.

&#x200B;

But does not miss.

&#x200B;

I turn, the illusion bursting from my frame as I take a moment to process what I'm seeing. A scarlet flower spreading from the center of her dress, as his child sinks to the floor, gasping for a breath. I barely hear the gun clatter to the floor, nor the door slam, nor the panicked footfalls of a condemned man, as I catch her before she falls, her dying body convulsing with final breaths, the very last of which nothing more than a whisper.

&#x200B;

"Please."

&#x200B;

And she lies still.

&#x200B;

I close my eyes, as I do the only thing I can, and sign the contract, carrying her body to the summoning circle. The portal crackles violently, threatening to reject the glowing soul in my grip, but simmers away as I camouflage its purity, now mired slightly with demonic deals, with the corruption of my own. I turn, and a spark drops from my fingers, burning unnaturally the moment it touches the floorboards, spreading with destructive intent, and without looking back I disappear through the portal.

&#x200B;

It has been a long time since then, and a smile comes to my face at the tiny skipping figure holding my hand as we stride across the sand. One of Hell's own now, unageing from that day, a single horn on the left side of her head, parting the golden hair like a waterfall over a boulder, and a complexion matching my own down the right half of her body, but Hell remains unable to claim any more of her that.

&#x200B;

She runs ahead, and I let out a raspy chuckle as she cheers at a successful cartwheel, and for a moment forget the misery of centuries, gazing back at the glowing footprints she leaves in the crimson, purity burning sin, like a golden thread weaving this land together. Others of my kind will follow, and perhaps things will become better under the light she brings.

&#x200B;

Perhaps all it takes for a desolate garden to grow, is one golden flower.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I suppose that's a blessing.
