Was it just 30 years?...it felt like an eternity. As a child learning to accept that others will use, violate, and hurt me...spending my life trying to be a healer.  Refusing to lift a hand to protect myself for fear of hurting others, instead accepting it. Being a fairy, rising above, making people laugh and feel safe and I was tired. I was done. I wanted so much the silent eternal sleep. 
But here I am, walking through the woods to this secluded forest clearing. And the small child with blonde bouncing curls, wearing only an adults white t-shirt and bare feet. Who is this beautiful little boy? 
And then...I turn to me. Tears streaming down a tiny cherub face I don't recognize, with sparkly eyes I do.  
"What's wrong? Why are you crying? What did I do?" "I'm a girl, but you called me a boy!" "Oooh, it's ok! You can be a boy if you want to!" I chuckle as I pull this beautiful spirit in for a snuggle. "Boys and girls are good!" And this tiny face is smiling back at me. "I'm proud of you. You grew up to help people. I wanted to be brave enough to help people", my tiny self says to me. We giggle and make fart jokes and high five and discuss how we never ended up Disney princesses. 
I take a deep breath and turn to me. To my fragile soul, still so ready see the beauty around us. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you back then." That child, beautiful eyes full of understanding, turns to me and says the most devastating words. "It's ok. You still can't."
And I realize I haven't died. I'm just in hell. I either have to learn to fucking protect myself and stop. Stop telling myself I just took a bullet for another girl. Me being brutalized did not prevent it from happening to someone else. Not then, not now.
Do I learn to protect us? Me and my tiny goddess self? Or just end it all forever separating myself from any more hurt but also any atonement...
