"Dad are clouds made of candy?" my son asked as ate another bite of ice cream. 

I chuckled and leaned back on the park beach where we sat and said "No son, you see those clouds up there made of millions of gallons of condensed water vapor."

"Oh, that's cool." he said, clearly disappointed in the answer given. We sat in silence for a moment. A pair of joggers ran past on an afternoon run. Behind us a family played with their dog. 

After eating a couple of bites of his ice cream he asked, "Dad, what are Earth's defense systems?" in a tone as innocent as the last question.

I looked at my son's face, but I didn't recognize it. His eyes had turned pitch black. No. There was nothing there, like two infinite voids where eyes should be. He repeated the question but I couldn't hear him. His voice was far away but he was getting closer. 

The park was dead quiet. The only sound I could hear was of my own heartbeat in my ears and my labored breathing. The air hung motionless and immovable around me. Sweat was pouring down my face. 

The kid's face was inches from mine. I couldn't hear him but I could tell he was screaming the same question at me over and over. My mouth was dry and I couldn't form words. I could only stare on as the void began to swallow me. I closed my eyes and leaned back.

And let go.

I opened my eyes and threw myself forward. I gasped and began to pant as I struggled to draw in air. The park was dark and deserted. The streetlamps flickered and buzzed attracting moths. I looked up at the half moon as my breathing became more calm and even. I looked down at the rolled up paper still smoldering between my fingers. 

"Man, I gotta stop smoking PCP."
