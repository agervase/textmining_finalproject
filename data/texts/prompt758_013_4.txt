It was a chilly, Monday morning when I was teleported out of my kitchen.  I ended up in a room with four hellish creatures.  They looked at me and I looked at them.  We both screamed at the same time.  They ran into the nearest bathroom to discuss what they should do.  I sat outside the door, listening to their plans.

“We should send her back,” said demon #1.

“We should vivisect her and see how humans work,” said demon #2.

“Nah,” said demon #1, “We aren’t Japanese nor German in WWII.”  

“We should not have played with that board,” whispered demon #3, “Master will whip us all again until we are near death.”

I ran behind the sofa as they came out.  I didn’t know what to do but be frightened.  Demons were notorious for tricking humans and wearing them like meatsuits when they go topside.  I found a dagger next to me.  Next thing I knew, all the demons were dead and I was covered in blood.  

The master walked in to see what the matter was.  I stood there and locked eyes with him.  The master growled at me.  Claws bared, he lunged at me.  I dodged and slashed him.

“Please send me back,” I said, “I didn’t want to be here.  I just wanted to finish my grilled cheese sandwich.”

“If you can beat me at chess, then I will let you go,” said the master.  He summoned a chess board from thin air.  The game began.

Move by move, we played.  Until I finally managed to get him into checkmate.  He howled that I cheated even though it was a fair match and really hard to cheat at chess.  

Quicker than lightning, I was returned to my home.  I returned to my skillet and finished my sandwich.  After which I nailed a horseshoe above my front door, so no demon or demonic power could enter and whisk me away again.
