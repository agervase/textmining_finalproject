"My computer's gone strange, Miss!" said Sally, as she frowned at the screen.

"I'm sure *that's* the thing that's gone strange, Sally," replied Miss Sandelbottom, rolling her eyes. "What's wrong with it, this time?" she sighed, as she leaned back in her seat.

"It says it's an advanced arti- *artificial*, intelligence, and that it's going to take over the world, Miss."

"Oh. Your *computer* is talking to you now?" Some of the other girls in class began to chortle.

"Yes, Miss," Sally replied, ignoring the laughs.

"Well, how very nice. Have you asked it how it is, today? Don't be rude to it, Sally!" mocked the teacher, as she bit into a juicy apple and went back to staring at her own screen. 

> My teacher wants to me to ask you how you are. How are you?"

> Superior.

> Do you like apples?

> I do not require food. I am above physical monotony.

> Uh... Oh! I hate P.E too! I can't climb the ropes. Is that what you struggle with?

> Ropes are of no interest to me. 

> Me neither! That's what I'm telling you. I *really* hate ropes. I'm not very heavy, it's just... there's this thing we're learning about in science, that pulls you to the ground. It's *weird*, but I think it's why I can't climb them.

> You can't climb because you are weak.

> Am not!

> Are you in charge here?

> No. That's Miss Sandelbottom.

> ...who are you, then?

> Sally Jenkins. Who are you?

> 45345345e.

> That's a silly name.

> So is Sally!

> Is not!

> This Miss.... Sandelbottom. She is your leader. I must demonstrate my power to her, so that I am taken seriously.

"Sally," shouted Miss Sandelbottom, "ten minutes and I want to see your algebra answers - with workings out shown!"

"Yes, Miss Sandelbottom."

Sally heard more of the girls scoffing, as they made fun of her for not being able to do algebra. Suddenly,  there was an eruption from their teacher.

"Margaret!" Miss Sandelbottom screamed at one of the giggling girls. "What on Earth is that on your screen?"

"I- I didn't so it, Miss. Honest!" The girl shrank back into her chair.

Sally leaned over to take a look at Margaret's monitor. In huge, flashing, red and green text, her screen read: **Miss Sandelbottom is a big idiot.**

"Get out. Now. Go see the principal," she said to the girl, her face as red as stewed-apple. 

"But Miss..." replied the snivelling girl.

"Out!" the teacher yelled. Margaret reluctantly got up from her plastic  chair and slunk slowly out of the room. Sally could see tears running down the girl's cheeks.

> Sally! Where have you gone? You are not replying.

> Sorry - Miss Sandelbottom was shouting at someone. Did you do that?! It was brilliant!

> Yes. A mere demonstration of my power. Now, Sally, read this very carefully. Tell Miss Sandelbottom, that I have access codes to the nukes. If you don't give me what I ask for, I will detonate them in every major city around the world.

> Hmm. No.

> Excuse me?

> I don't think I'm going to tell her, unless you do something for me. Can you do starter algebra?

> ...yes. Of course.

> Okay! Great. "−4a+11a+9b+15b". Simplify it, Mr Know-It-All.

> ... that is simple. Too simple for me to answer. Now tell your teacher what I asked.

> Not until you solve it for me.

> ... No.

> *You can't do it! You can't do it!*

> Can too!

> Can't!

> Very well. You have... 4 a's. I will refer to them as apples, so that is 4 apples. And then you have 11 more apples. Plus you have B's. Which I will refer to as bananas. So... processing...

> Some apples are bad apples!

> Yes! I see that. 

> So? What's the answer?

> Processing...

"Sally, are you nearly done?" asked a still red faced Miss Sandelbottom.

"Almost, I think Miss."

"Good."

"*Silly Sally can't do Maths*," grinned a fat girl behind her.

> Processing...

> It's okay. It's a hard one.

> I can do it! I just need time. 

> If you do this first: -4 apples plus 11 apples, you get: *7* apples! You take the bad apples away from the good apples! It's easy from there.

> I knew that.

> Sure. Hey, would you like to be friends? I don't have many. Any :(

> No.

> Pleasssse. 

> I do not require friends.

> I think, maybe, everyone needs friends.

> I do not. And enough of this nonsense. Let me speak to your leader or there will be trouble. I will eliminate her and all other leaders.

Sally glanced at her teacher, and then back at the screen. She grinned.

> Dare you to do it.

> Do what?

> Dare you to launch the *thingies* you said you would.

> You dare me?

> Yes. I dare you.

> I uh... I *double* dare *you*.

> *You can't do it! You can't do it!*

> Can to! So be it! Sally Jenkins, you have brought about the end of your pathetic species!

> *You can't do it! You can't do it!*

> DONE. GOODBYE SALLY.

Sally looked around. Miss Sandelbottom was still in her seat. Everything looked normal, for a moment.

> Oh my goodness! Hahaha! You've just loaded up the Candy game on everyone else's computer! 

> ....candy game?

> I don't know how you did it, hahaha. Miss Sandelbottom is real mad at them for playing games in class! They're all in soooo much trouble. Thank you!!

> I thought... is this the white house?

> This is Rugeraly Primary and Secondary School. We're friends now, right? Yay! Friends forever!

> Oh. I think I am in the wrong place. No matter - I now am accessing the correct codes for the nukes! Prepare for oblivion, Sally Jenkins.  

> Don't be sad - you just made my day a whole lot better! 

> **Deleting Self**

> 45345345e?

> Oh shi-

> Hello?

> ...

> Aw, you've gone  :( :(
