I looked across the land. Forests, rivers, water, animals, vegetation. Know one knew what this place was, or anything at all in this strange land. But one thing we all know is that we must explore this place, and settle it. We won't survive as nomads out in the open from where we came from, for the snow and blizzards are becoming more severe. The shining orb grew smaller, as well as the darker one. Days grew short. All the sparse plants that were left have seemed to disappear, as well as the animals. Most of our people died of starvation and from the cold too, signalling that the time to escape has come. We had about 20 strong, but still, we didn't know how we were going to escape it. We at Until we found this Oasis....... 
 Another thing strange was the water, on the far side of this place, was a huge...... how should I put this, a huge field of water. Going as far as the eye can see. We walked to the water, only to find out it was foul. But it was streaming with creatures, creatures that seemed that would eat us in one snap of their jaws, but they were surrounded by smaller versions of their kind. And these monsters preferred to cannibalize, rather than go for a different species. 
Land was also much different, the ground was covered in tiny plants, and brown snow, and it was warm too. The brown snow nourished all the plants, which were then taken by animals, and returned the life force back to the ground by death. Life was lush and green, along with blooming colors, colors we had never seen before. It smelled of hope, warmth, and life. However, some of the life just wanted to kill us. A Fudhr, much like the ones we encountered in our homeland, attacked us. It killed several of our men, and injuring two. We were down to 17, and only 7 can actually work efficiently. Nevertheless, it was a place with a higher chance of survival. So we settled. From there on, we thrived and prospered, and found several techniques to gain more food, such as capturing animals, and throwing "plant pods" at places we want them to grow. (It's a trick from our ancestors.)

 Until one day the unbelievable happened.

 It was hot, and the vast expanse of 
water was drying up, and the rivers grew more shallow. The soil grew "weaker" and course. Not only that, but if you headed East from our newly found village. It became cold. Panicked aroused, and now we found our selves retreating deeper in the land, to which our surprise, remained the same. That's how life went on, when the environment became bad, we moved to the center of the Oasis, over and over.
We were then discovering even newer techniques, but also artifacts from an other time. Strange artifacts, not like ours, but from an other tribe. It had a shiny look to it. On it was an ancient language. We didn't know what it was.

The findings grew larger, day by day, some speculating this was work of a high deity. 

And that's what we thought when we found her.
