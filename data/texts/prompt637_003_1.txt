I started my journey to earth from mustafar which is few thousand light years away. My sole aim is to study earth and it's life. Having origins from a volcanic planet, I never knew how water feels like. My impetus has thrived me to jump into light speed. As time never passed I reached planet earth. Earth is a beautiful place, occupied mostly with water it seemed so pleasant unlike mine. I found myriad amount of species which live together in a diverse way. I started liking this place where I felt most alive since my birth. It didn't take much time for me to realise that humans are the most advanced and intelligent species on earth. So I started to observe and study them. Humans are diverse among themselves, they live in a unique way, None of them have identical lifestyles. They have peculiar languages and contrasting diets. They have higher tendency to progress. They believe in miracles , that might be the first time I'm listening that word. Though no one is related to other, I found they are all interconnected by thing called humanity. 

Nevertheless everyone is so different, uncommonly I started hearing about 'golden rule'. It's a rule I was never aware of, but seemed like all humans knew about it. But no one were presuming to tell me as I was under disguise. Later I had to convince myself that it's a source that supplies power for human existence. But when I came here I've decided to learn everything about earth. I couldn't hold my guilt any longer, I started treating humans in adverse way. I was ignored and left unresponsive . After living for eons on earth , it started seeming like I have never even been here before. That was the moment my consciousness made me realise it's because of golden rule . Golden rule is a principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. I was too late to realise , I've decided to come back. It's gonna be a happy ride back home.
