"Steve Carrell," I yelled, banging my hand against the table. "How about Steve Carrell? The Academy loves a comic 
actor turning serious."

"We talked to him," Zed replied. "He's doing a movie about Wall Street and the housing market crisis."

"Beautiful! An industry that makes billions every year and controls the mass media in the most powerful country in the world criticizing capitalism! It's a winner!"

"We also got Bryan Cranston doing a screenwriter blacklisted during the communist witch hunt."

"Perfect!"

"And Michael Fassbender doing Steve Jobs – written by Aaron Sorkin, no less." Zed spoke that last part with pride, 
like he knew how good it was.

"We're covered, man!" I said, happily. "We're covered! No way Leo's getting it this year!"

"And…" Zed smirked, and leaned forwards, resting his chin on his hands on his elbows on the table (god, what an 
awful sentence). "We've got Matt Damon in Mars."

"Fuck, Zed!" I leaned back, lighting a cigar. "We've outdone ourselves this time! There is *no *way* Leo takes this 
Oscar."

Zed smiled at me, lighting his cigar too. Another year, another success. We were covered.

Or so we thought.

&nbsp;

"What the fuck happened!?" Zed is yelling at me now, blocking the view of the TV, where the pre-show girl in the 
cleavage interviews Chloe Moretz on E!'s red carpet special.

"I don’t know! I don't know!"

"I organized everything so well! I talked to producers, I talked to the actors, I moved mountains to get these movies made! And you're telling me Leo is the favorite!? How can that be!?"

"Zed, I don't know how it happened!" I stuff my face in my hands. Then I raise my eyes. "Apparently people weren't in the mood for yet another Jobs movie, or watching Matt Damon get rescued again. Steve Carell wasn't even nominated for Big Short, and *not even Bryan Cranston saw Trumbo!*"

"Well, this is it. Humanity is doomed," Zed cries, as the lady announces that we're just five minutes away from the 
ceremony. "The second Leo gets his hand on that Oscar, it's all over. He'll destroy the Earth." He pauses. "We gotta do something, man!"

"It's too late now, Zed," I say, shaking my head. "Let's just call our families. Say our goodbyes."

"Unless…" Zed stops, turning his eyes to me, his hand on his chin on his knee on the couch (fuck it, I'm wearing it with pride now).

"What?"

"We could call… *him*."

"You don't mean…"

"Yes I mean him." Zed gets up and takes three fast steps towards me, resting his hand on my shoulders.  "It's our only hope."

"Zed, he's an alien. Plus, it's too late, the Oscars start in two minutes."

"So? He can do it!"

"We can't put down a movie for Oscar consideration two minutes before the ceremony, Zed!"

"He can do it!" Zed roars. "You know he can!"

"It's too risky, Zed. We don't know what he's capable of."

"What other choice do we have!?"

Zed's eyes are locked on mine. Dead serious.

I sigh. "All right, then. Call him."

&nbsp;

One hour and forty minutes later, Zed and I are side by side on the couch, watching as Kate Mara finishes 
announcing the nominees for best actor in a lead role.

"It won't work," I say, quietly. "It won't work, not even *he* can pull this one out."

By my side, Zed watches in silence, his breath heavy and slow. Eyes locked on the screen.

And the Oscar goes to," Kate says, tearing the envelope open. "Leonardo Di –"

The applause starts, but stops at once as a man storms the stage. He whispers something in Kate's ear, then takes 
the envelope from her hand and gives her a second one, identical.

"We're very sorry," Kate says, in a hush. "But it looks like we have a sixth nominee." Clearing her throat, she tears 
the second envelope open. "Well… the Oscar goes to…" Her eyes go wide, and a smile crosses her face. "Matthew Mcconaughey, for 'Thirty Second Video Of Me Saying 'All Right, All Right, All Right' Uploaded To Youtube Just a Few Seconds Ago'"!

The winning music starts, and the camera switches to Leonardo DiCaprio's incredulous face. Zed jumps up in the 
air. "He did it! The motherfucker did it!"

I cry, getting up too and hugging Zed as we watch Matthew climbing up on the stage.

He takes the statue. Kisses Mara. Looks straight down at the first roll, frozen smile, eyes locked on Leo DiCaprio's face.

He raises the Oscar up in the air. Eyes still on Leo. 

Takes a deep breath. Widens his smile.

And says....
