With the last of the crystal's power absorbed into my spirit, I collapsed onto the floor. "R-Rose..." I called out, "The hell did you do to me?"

There was no reply. Before me, in what little light existed in the chamber, I could see the silhouette of a man. He called out to me in a hollow, raspy voice, "Heya! Seems you've got it figured out, eh?" He suddebly appeared next to me and helped me up off the ground.
 
Now that he was close, I could see him well. He was skeletal, yet warm. He had the appearence of a human skeleton dressed up in a plaid shirt, long jeans, a full beard, and a beanie. An electronic cigarette hung from an old-school leather satchel. On his back was strapped a gigantic black scythe.

"Howdy. I'm Death. I've-"

"Aren't you supposed to dress in all black?"

"I did, and you know what I said when I did it? I said 'it's not a phase'. Anywho, I've stopped time so that I can explain things." Death made a noise not unlike clearing his throaght. "Congratulations! You've escaped death! That is, lowercase d death. I'm still here."

I grumbled. "Yeah cool, I know that."

"No you didn't."

"No I didn't."

"Righty ho. I'm meant to give you this." He handed me a business card. "When ya realize living forever sucks, call this number. I've got a job offer for you. Oh, by the way, yes. You are indeed immortal, but not invincible. Steer clear of bullets and tigers. You can catch diseases but not die of them."

"Hold on a minute, what is this job?"

"Angel of death, now, I really must be leaving. Goodbye!"

Death vanished in a flash of blinding light, and time un-stopped. I said "Angel of death, huh? Sounds boring". And I ripped the card in two and found the door.
