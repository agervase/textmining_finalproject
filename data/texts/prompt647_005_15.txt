Martinez was always first through the door. His speed made him a perfect entry man, so long as there was an exit. In three seconds, he could knock out a dozen tangos, but it took every ounce of energy he had. Wilson followed as fast as he could, checking the stunned enemies for the marks Martinez left, and killing or incapacitating them as necessary. One gloved hand meant you lived, but bare skin sent you to the reaper. Kowalski would scout ahead, vanishing through a wall or a door. He was basically invisible once he changed states, but he couldn't carry anything with him and was only good for recon. There's nothing like a pasty 6'6" Marine materializing inches from you, buck naked and vomiting uncontrollably.

And I was last. Always last through the door. There was no coordinated hobo shuffle like my past units. I just walked in, no fear of enemy fire. I had complete trust in my squad. But not having "exceptional" powers like the others meant I had to work twice as hard and sacrifice on every mission. I carried the heaviest loads - almost half my weight for a combat loadout. I carried a breaching shotgun to get Martinez smoothly across the threshold, and just about everything else the team needed: ammo, spare batteries, extra radio, NVGs, med kit. Just as  I relied on the team for their special skills, they relied on me to bring the things they couldn't carry. Even a few big, heavy things that just might save your ass. That's why I carried the bolt cutters.

Don't get me wrong - I have powers. House party powers. "Hey, y'all - watch this" kind of powers. I lost the end of my finger at Parris Island and was astonished when it grew back. The squad and the docs were amazed that I could instantly regrow my extremities. I never let on about the pain. It hurts, almost as much as losing a limb. But violent change to the musculoskeletal network has their upsides, too. Cracking knuckles makes fingers glow. Same for pulling ears, popping toes, and cracking your back. But only one of those was useful in combat. Being last through the door meant clearing a lot of rooms and marking them as such by dropping a glow stick. I carried a 20 pack of the neon green ones - well... usually. 56 straight hours of shelling will make you forgetful.

Kowalski appeared in front of me, reporting though bouts of regurgitation. "9 rooms. 15 tangos." I handed him his BDUs and breached the door. Martinez entered the first room and as usual met me in the middle of the room. He had sprinted ahead and taken out 12 enemy combatants in 6 rooms. That made our job easier, but there was still work to do. As Wilson played God, I grabbed my left belt pouch and came to a horrifying realization - I had forgotten the glow sticks. I pulled off my gloves, thinking they had gotten stuck in the pouch - but no dice. The pouch was empty. I muttered a curse word under my breath and knew that we needed a way to mark the room.

By the time Wilson was done, I had made up my mind - the mission had to succeed. I handed him the bolt cutters, cracked my left pinky, and braced for the pain.
