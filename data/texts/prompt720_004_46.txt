***I have seen so much.***


When humanity transcended the limitations of mortality, there was a vocal minority that maintained we were losing what made us who we were as a species.  The spark that made us outgrow our birthplace, and strike out towards the stars. The will to dominate those who were in our way

As it happened, they were right.

The Transcendence marked the high point of Human civilization.  Arts and culture flourished, geniuses no longer running out of time to create. Even those who had no talent had the time to learn any subject or master any art.  New sciences unlocked limitless potential.  

Mighty fleets patrolled a vast empire, building Dyson spheres to steal away the power of the stars.  Drone armies tidily brushed away any inconvenient life that had the misfortune of existing in our way. Each controlled by a relative handful of Human minds, trillions of miles away.  

Our unimaginable, unchallenged dominion was a law of the universe.  The machinery of our preeminence was greased by the viscera of lesser beings.

***Our Hubris was colossal. We treated the universe as we had our cradle***

Time passed, as it does even for those whose existence no longer abides by its passage.  All that could be learned, was.  All that could be created, was. A terrible sense of *Weltschmerz* descended. Reality was disappointing, it was limited.  

It started slowly.  It was an Artist who did it first, fell into their own mind and ceased communicating with the outside world.  Lost themselves in the depths of their own consciousness to create unrestrained by what few laws were immutable. Lost for all time.  

We communicated so little by then, what was there left to say after all.  It had been thousands of years since I had spoken to anyone. I had elected to explore the edges of the universe.  Beyond even the Imperators and their drones. I was unaware of what had become of us.

I came across it by happenstance, an engineer fleet in the act of building a Dyson sphere.  The sphere was half finished, the drones frozen in the act of construction. I queried and got no answer.  The Fabricator to whom they belonged and elected to build in his dreams.

I reached out, moving faster and faster.  Racing from system to system.  Even when all logic dictated that there was no one to be found, I searched. Our edifices were crumbling away, our accomplishments turning to dust.

 I went insane for a time, I think.

***The terrible emptiness. The absolute silence.  There was nothing, there was no one***

Time ground relentlessly by. I slouched in the ruins of what Humanity had wrought. Too angry and hurt and proud to succumb to dreaming.  Dreaming.  Call it what it is, suicide by boredom.

I listened to the universe through the ears of a billion billion satellites.  And I waited.

***I remember when the first of you reached out to the stars. It was like a match in the dark.  Such a small light, so tentative.  So vulnerable.***

I heard you, the first time you left your home faster the the light of your star. Your ships were so small, so crude, so interestingly built. I had never imagined a ship could be built just like that. I followed you, watching you slowly progress through the stars nearest to you.  I grew to love you, as I imagine we loved our children once.  I watched you meet the first other sentient beings you encountered.

And I grew angry.  

Just as we once had you strove to dominate, to remove, to relocate,  so you could seize their resources as your own.  This I would not allow.  I intervened in a way you would understand. 

As your weapons ceased to function, I spoke to you.  All of you.  This way was not the way. Homogeneity was the route to madness.

***I was so proud. You listened, both of you.  I was so worried you wouldn't.  That you would deny the wisdom I sought to give you.***

***That was so very long ago wasn't it?  Now there are so many of you, united in a thriving community made of a million million species.  You have surpassed us in so many ways.***

***I cannot continue as I am. I am weary beyond imagining.  I must sleep. I must Dream.  You do not need my guidance any longer.  You are beyond it. I love you all.***
