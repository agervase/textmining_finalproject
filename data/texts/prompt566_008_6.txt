Abe scuffled up to the edge of The Lords son and slowly, ever so gently squeezed the top of his nose.
“Wait! Ya frikkin idiot, you’ll hurt him? Maybe wha worse than the damn rat!” The figure of a shepherd shouted at him.
“Wally, believe me you, if we don’t get a new Lord our crops will die. Our people are being slaughtered by the Satanic demon and my wife has been taken. We. Need. This. Lord.” Abe had a tear in his eye and used all the strength in his hands to nip the top of the giants nose.

“Yaaaargh! What the fuck!” Jerry woke, eyes bulging then narrowing to see two of his fathers figurines gazing at him in awe. Weren’t they the ones usually stuck in front of that barn.. wasn’t the one in the blue dungarees usually waving? Not on his knees screaming? Wait.. screaming?

“Aaaaargh!”

“Aaaaaargh!”

After a few moments of both parties screaming, the following dialogue occurred;

“Lord, since the Great Lord passed we have been needing a new Lord to praise. To bring us light and show us the right way.. and to help us plough and herd the cattle.. our train can only provide some light but was derailed the night a gigantic abomination came and wrought gigantic destruction in its wake! Please sir, Lord, please help the town of Smithsville!” Abe clung his flat cap between his hands as the shepherd figure next to him patted him on the back with one hand. Jerry noticed a bite mark in the side of the second figure where his arm should of been. 

“I am a simple shepherd, I fought the good fight. Me and 3 other good men. A train driver, a horse rancher and a sherriff. I survived but my arm gone took off with the beast.. all good men, all lost to the savage beast of Smithsville.. please sir, Lord. Help us bring back the light and fight the demon.”

Jerry blinked a few times, assumed he was in a strange yet interesting dream and scooped up the figurines in his hand. Well, he thought as he creeped down into the dark basement, this could be interesting..
