After years of standing in line, I finally got to the door of the grotto. What I found was more queues. The grotto seemed tiny from outside but within it was a vast catheral, the ceiling was lost in the heavens and the walls on either side were hundreds of metres away. At the opposite end from the door I had walked in were a row of doors, each as grand and impressive as the building itself. Leading up to to each door was a short queue. I was met at the entrance by an officious looking, balding man with a clipboard "Smith, John" he said in a grandfatherly tone, "Welcome to the hall of judgement, please join queue number 42, agnostics, Catholics and atheists from Earth, all questions will be answered by the steward". I knew I was queueing for judgement, the long queue outside the grotto snaked and zigzagged like the queues at Disneyland. I had many interesting conversations with all sorts of people, each with their own idea of what we were to meet at the end of the queue, most thought it was some form of judgement.

I made my way slowly past the rows of velvet rope that seperated the queues. Finally I found queue 42, I walked along the bay and stood behind an old couple, who were holding hands and joking cheerfully about how all this queueing was a comforting reminder of home. They queue was short but it moved slowly. I struck up a conversation with them and we filled the few hours we had to wait by telling each other our life stories. They had been from Norwich in England, high school sweethearts who had been seperated by the second world war, when he went off and fought in France she stayed at home and grew vegetables on a farm. She had fallen in love with one of the other girls on the farm and for the next ten years they lived together, pretending to be good cathlics by day but secretely lovers in private. He had been captured by the Nazis and briefly lived as a prisoner of war. He escaped with a small group of other english soldiers and they had made their way across europe, trying to get home and killing small bands of Nazis where he could. Finally they had been rescued just before VE day. He fell into a life of drink and drugs back home, constantly reliving the war in his mind. until by chance he met his high school sweetheart after being rushed into hospital one day. He had suffered a heart attack, while she had just said goodbye to her land girl, who had died tragically early of cancer. Their love was rekindled and gradually these two helped each other battle their demons, eventually settling into a comfortable old age together. They had died within hours of each other.

They were both convinced they were to go straight to hell. He for killing, drink, drugs; her for being gay and for lying to her priest and congregation.

As we got to the front of the queue she was called first. She took one last look at her love and turned to face the steward. The cavernous room had so far absorbed the noise of the conversations between the steward and those before us, but now we were close enough we could hear what was said. The man and I stood in trepidation. The steward had a plinth with a large book in front of him. He turned the page as the woman approached and started to speak "Mary Henderson, you are to be judged. If the balance of your actions left a positive impact on those around you, you will go to heaven, if you left a negative impact, you will go to hell, do you understand?" he said. At that, she started to speak "Steward, I know that according to my religion I have sinned badly. I accept that I will walk through the door to hell this day". The steward, taking a softer tone said "Mary, the most important rule of your religion is that given by Christ, love your brother as you love yourself. In that respect you have lived a good life. You loved two people faithfully, holding one's hand till the end of her life and helping the other get over deep tragedy. However in other ways you have been a net negative in the world. In leviticus it is stated, you shall not round the corners of your head, it means that you should keep your intellect sharp, but in your later years you became lazy and stupid, so you weren't able to guide your family and community with wisdom. It is also said, do not wear clothing made of two diferent kinds of material, by that we mean, do not subject yourself to internal conflict. In that way you have also failed, your lost love was ever on your mind, even in later life, so you did not love your second love as fully as you could, that led him to feel neglected, as if he was ever living in the shadow of your former love. These sins are not outweighed by your good acts. But they should act as a warning to you. Your judgement is that you have not reached the standards required to enter heaven, but neither are you damned, you will go back to Earth and live again, next time you appear here you will remember both lives, but until then your life as Mary will be hidden from you" At that he gestured to the door to his left, and Mary walked through with a look back to her former love.

As the man walked up, the steward turned the page again "George Anderson, you are to be judged. If the balance of your actions left a positive impact on those around you, you will go to heaven, if you left a negative impact, you will go to hell, do you understand?". George cleared his throat "well sir, if it doesn't inconvenience you too badly, I'd like to folow my mary back to earth. She was a great help to me in later life and I would have long ago fallen into a pit of despair without her". The Steward looked up from his plinth and adressed George directly, as he had with Mary. "George, you have killed in life, this is the worst sin a man can commit. However, the men you killed would have gone on to kill, rape and maim thousands of others. You suffered through years of regret and misery because of your actions, and you faithfully loved Mary. Even when chances to cheat presented themselves, and she was distant and difficult. Each soul is responsible for itself, and your place in heaven is guaranteed, you can walk through the golden door now if you choose. However If you choose to, I can grant your request and allow you to follow Mary back to earth. You will have no memory of your life as George, but you will be close to her. If you find each other again I can see that you will both help each other through life again. But it is not guaranteed that this will happen. And you will be judged on the actions of both lives when you appear here again, so you may lose your place in heaven. Do you accept this risk?" "Of course" said George. "Then walk through the door".

&#x200B;

I was next to be judged. I won't document it word for word here. But I was lucky, I got my place in heaven. I found I was allowed to ask any question I wanted while talking to the steward. So I asked him about George and Mary, would they really be ok in the next life? He told me that the two cloths rule, relating to internal conflict, was one of the most important in setting a persons life on the right path. "If a person chooses a good path and sticks to it, then they will find themselves judged well at the end of their life. But if they are conflicted and do not wholeheartedly follow a good path, if they dwell on other paths and are not settled and whole, they will naturally lead to sin, and a negative judgement"

I am not in heaven today, I am back on earth. I too found my way back here, but I am no longer a person. I am what you might call a guardian angel. I chose to help George and Mary find their path and the steward was happy to allow it. The only problem is that they have been reborn and I don't know who they are now. I'm here until they both die, so I've made my own choice. I will use my small influence on the world to help people settle on their path, help people not to "mix cloth" and follow their own good path. I am lucky, I can influence peoples minds a little, to write a short story or make a comment where it's required. My hope is that when I find my way back to the grotto I'll meet George and Mary again. Who will have read this story and resolved to follow a good path, and got in to heaven.
