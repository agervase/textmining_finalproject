Ever since the accident in my childhood, when my grandmother realized I had the family curse, I had been told this day would come. Hunters. Witches. Witch-hunters. Sick men who insist that they are vivisecting you *for science*. Cannibals. Nana warned me that our family curse is not immortality, it is a guaranteed horrific death. I looked up and saw my abductor sitting in a chair across the room. Oh god, I hope she is not a cannibal.

"Where am I?" I hissed as I began to come to, my head throbbing and my vision slowly clearing. 

I recognized the small woman from before. Now in strange clothes, she got up from her chair and approached me with her hands extended. 
"You're safe," said she in a calm voice. It was soft but not the same light giggle-inflected Latin she had when we met at the feast earlier. 

"What did you give me?" I demanded.  

"Oh just a mix of mead, drain cleaner, and a dash of cyanide in lieu of bitters," she answered, sitting on the hard floor next to me. "It might have been overkill, but that was the point. I had to know it was you," she continued. 

"Are you satisfied with your proof?" I asked with a grimace. As far as I know the only way to truly kill me is to make it impossible for my body to heal, but I feel pain. I feel every wound, every death, even if I am able to heal. I didn't know what was coming, but if she knew who I was and to test my abilities with poison, nothing good was going to come. I should have known a daughter of Rome would have never wanted to share a drink with me. Now I doubted she was even Roman. Her accent was strange. This place, stranger. Strangest of all, she was addressing me in my language. My *old* language.

"I'm glad I didn't kill a random guy, yes," she replied with a sly smile.

"How do you know my language?" I asked. I never could have guessed her answer.

"You taught it to us so you would trust us. The future depends on it."
