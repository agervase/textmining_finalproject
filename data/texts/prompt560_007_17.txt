"Please, sir, you can have anything, my wallet, my car keys, just don't hurt my..."

SIMULATION OVER.

It all came flooding back. I'm not a human, but a Trilliax, and had been under a neural block for the last 37 years, trapped in that simulated world as a prison sentence. Amazing, though... I could still remember it all. The wife. The kids. The terror in the pit of my stomach while staring down the barrel of the mugger's pistol. I had been a composer. So much to think about. One thought did come to mind though...

I had been sentenced to 82 years. The system had never had an error before. I was trying to figure out why, what had happened. The system never made errors. I didn't have to wait long, at least. The text began scrolling across the screen, as the simulation over message faded.

DUE TO YOUR PERFORMANCE IN THE PREVIOUS SIMULATION, YOU HAVE QUALIFIED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLY RELEASE. AS PART OF THE PROCEDURE, YOU MUST CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BETA TEST OF 2ND LIFE, OUR BETA SIMULATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LONG SENTENCES. AS NEURAL BLOCKING ONLY SUPPRESSES IDENTITY BASED KNOWLEDGE, YOU WILL RETAIN ALL SKILLS AND PROFICIENCIES LEARNED IN YOUR PREVIOUS SIMULATIONS, THOUGH YOU WILL NOT RECALL ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY OR YOUR ACQUISITION OF THESE SKILLS. IF YOU CONSENT TO THIS BETA TEST, PLEASE ENTER YOUR SELECTED NAME. TIME AND GEOGRAPHY WILL BE RANDOMLY GENERATED, AS WAS LAST TIME. CONSENT WILL APPLY A 10 YEAR CREDIT TO YOUR SENTENCE.

So that was it.  10 years for being a Guinea pig. Worse things have happened, I suppose. I focused my thoughts towards the name entry. I was out of practice, though; it took a couple moments. The symbols slowly appeared as my thoughts cleared.

"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"
