It was funny at the beginning you know? Torture in itself is funny. I mean, look at Todd. The big wanna-be adventurer, now stuck in a perpetual nightmare where his mother is being violent and aggressive towards him and as soon as he pushes her back she will drop dead and he will watch in horror to his deeds. Bob? Over there? I don't give him food. I casted divine regeneration on him and gave him the tools to cut his own part of his body to eat. When he's long gone I will release him as a wild cannibal on his own village.

Yes, its all fun and good. Food for the dragon if you will. But what about of the elders? Who's worse? The sadist pig or the hand that feeds the sadist pig?

So I decided to give them a lesson. Just for kicks. So I saw the new sacrifice-election. Elderman Gaston took yet another paper from their sacrificial hat and the name of his grandson appeared. He managed to read the paper before taking it from the hat. So, of course, he just grabbed another. And the same name appeared. This was more obvious to the public. His colleagues watched him with curiosity. He looked at them with fear. They've never put the names of their own family in the hat. He knew something was wrong. 


-Is something wrong Gaston? -asked Elder Krum

-N-no -replied elder Gaston watching him and the crowd


Three, four, twenty times. The public was eyeing him suspiciously.


-Well then... What does the paper says? -asked a villager
Elder Gaston decided to just lie. But which kid to doom? They all had their concience clear when it was just the hat deciding. But now? He panicked
-Mary's son
Everyone stared at him.
-Which Mary? -asked a voice in the mob
-Lumbart -replied Gaston
More silence. Then the voice of Mary.
-YOU SON OF A ****. ELDER LOBIUS PROMISED TO NOT PUT MY NAME IF I LAYED WITH HIM

Chaos ensued. In the chaos, the hat flipped showing the name of Gaston's grandson. It was fun. Really fun. Nobody showed again in the doors of my temple. Well.. nobody besides Gaston, taking his grandson's place. He's over there... and there... and bits of him there.
