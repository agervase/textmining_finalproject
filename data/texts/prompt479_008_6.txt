Becky stopped around a corner to catch her breath, her heart was racing after running what seemed like half the campus. As she stared up at the moonless night, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. 

She was just about to go to a show with her friend Ron when they ran in to Ben on the way. Everything seemed fine, Becky did her best to keep her cool around him, but when she introduce Ron he just lost it. It didn't make any sense, one minute they were about to shake hands and right around when she said "Ron" he just pounced on him. All she could see was blood and screams and...

Becky calmed herself. "It's okay Becky, breathe. This isn't real. This *can't* be real. Hehe, I bet those guys met beforehand and this is just some prank meant to scare me." She began slowly walking back, only half believing herself. As much as she wanted to, something about it just seemed so real and sudden, but it couldn't be real, Ron was one of the nicest guys she knew, he couldn't hurt a fly. As she turned around the corner to where they had been standing in the southern courtyard she was shocked to see, nothing. Nobody was anywhere to be seen. She began calling out for Ben, or Ron, or anybody, and was answered with only a breeze, a breeze with a slightly odd smell to it. 

"Oh god" Becky said covering her face, as the breeze changed direction the smell became more intense, from an ambiguous stink to a putrid stench. It smelled like the cafeteria had dumped their bad meat at the same time that the schools septic tank had burst. Becky headed for her dorm content with never encountering this smell again, "I'm sure Ben and Ron are fine, I'll just check in on them tomorrow". However as she walked she had a troubling realisation: The smell had gotten *stronger*. Practically filling her nose at this point, she decided she had had *enough* of tonight, covered her nose and started running towards her dorm. Down the stairs, left around the lower atrium and two buildings past the eastern gymnasium and she would finally be... be... 

Becky dropped to her knees. She wanted to look away but she needed to take it all in, to find any way it could be not real.As the intense sound of blood rushing through her head faded she heard a soul curdling scream only to realize it was hers, as were the tears running down her face. Strung up against the A in gymnasium, was Ben, bloody, beaten and most notably dissembowelled. As Becky wept and scream to the air for help she felt a hand on her shoulder and jumped up so fast she felt as though she may very well leave her skin behind. As she turned she saw Ron, bloody and disheveled. "RON! Ron oh my god Ron please help, first that whole thing before and now..." She could barely speak as she helplessly choked on her tears. " Oh my god Ron what happened to you *WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN* oh my god are you okay?" 

Ron grabbed her shoulders to steady her "Hey now, it's fine, I'm fine, **everything is fine**". Becky began to calm down even if only a little "But, but BEN". Ron pulled her into his shoulder and pet her hair as comfort "Shhhhh shh, it's okay, what's important is that you and I are both fine, and now there's nobody in the way anymore, you should be *happy*." Ron responded. Becky pushed off his chest "Happy?! Ron, BEN IS DEAD!!", Her disgust was only furthered by his smile at that remark "Exactly! Now there's no one to come in between us, Ben tried to take you away from me *but now Ben's gone*, we can finally be together, forever."

Ron reached in to embrace her again but Becky was quick enough to avoid it, she still hadn't made sense of **any** of this and things kept getting crazier by the second. Just trying to break things down made her thoughts sound like Grand Central Station during rush hour. All she knew was that she had to get away from Ron *now*. "Don't you want us to be together forever?" Ron said, his arms outstretched, creeping forward. All Becky could muster was "Please don't follow me!" Before taking off in a mad dash for her dorm house. She looked back for a moment to see nothing behind her before she crashed into something soft, something wet, something Ron. "Oh come on now, I've been chasing after you for months, doesn't that earn me something?" His facial features were odd, caricatures of what they were, his eyes seemed smaller, yet his mouth seemed larger, but all Becky could think of was his *speed* " Wha- how did- when-." Reasoning was beyond her now, the only thing her brain would let her focus on was survival as she ran down the nearest alley. She could still hear Ron's voice echoing behind her "You know, it really hurt my feelings when you said I was your friend^ I mean I've always been nothing but a gentleman and thats all I get?^ I guess it's true what they say about nice guys."

Becky stopped around a corner to catch her breath, her heart was racing after running what seemed like half the campus. As she stared up at the moonless night, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. Her thoughts were cut of by a loud deep voice in the distance 

"**OKAY BECKY NOW YOU'RE MAKING ME MAD**" 

"**I COULD TREAT YOU SO MUCH BETTER THAN BEN**"

"**WHY DONT GIRLS LIKE YOI GIVE NICE GUYS LIKE ME A CHANCE**"

"**BECKY**"

Becky was stuck in a dead end, with nowhere to run. With no escape her only choice was to hide behind the pile of trash at the end of the alley. "PLEASEâ€‹ DONT FIND ME PLEASE DONT FIND ME PLEASE DONT FIND ME" was all she could think, the closest semblance she could muster to a prayer. A prayer which was unanswered as she heard a loud * *WOMP* * in front of her hiding spot followed by a low animalistic growl, and the final words she would hear from the beast she thought was her best friend

"**Becky**... **LEMME SMASH**".
