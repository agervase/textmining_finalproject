There's a backstory, but I don't think we should focus on the details too much. Long story short: I took a #2 on a #1 God from like a #32 civilization and now I'm sentenced to immortality. I still maintain that the altar looked like a toilet and I was just offering up the natural sacrifice of a pretty giant burrito that was as good going in as it was going out.

I get it, you're disgusted.

Not my deal. You're going to come and go. Hard to give a shit when I already gave it to the altar.

The God was mad AF though. I was low key worried at first. It was some Mexican or Aztec god or something. Chipotle was his name I think. Or maybe that was the burrito. It's been a while since it all went down and, honestly? I'm not trying to dwell on the past. I'm only telling you about it because you asked.

Anyways, things got real weird after 2000. People just kept creating all sorts of stuff and society went all haywire. The banned gender in like 2030, so everyone just went by "gurp." Then they started with all this genetics crap, so all of a sudden people were all superhuman and shit. But only rich people.

So all the poor people got super mad and revolted and blew a bunch of stuff up. And then the global warming stuff happened because everything was all on fire. Dark Ages 2.0. Only they weren't as dark on account of all the burning crap. Smokey Ages.

Yeah. That's better.

At least people weren't called gurp any more.

Then we rebuilt society. Well, not me. I'm not really the laboring type. More of an executive manager. Consultant. Whoever that guy is that comes in and doesn't know anything about anything but everyone has to listen because some other guy with a bigger office said you had to. I'm that guy. But I don't bother to show up either. I'm just out there. Chillin'.

Anyways. Society got built up again but then we blew it up again.

Rebuilt again, but this time we banned colors. I still didn't get that at all. Like, if someone was wearing a color everyone FLIPPED the F out. Like, people were "color subversives" and everyone refused to admit the sky was blue and crap like that. People are strange.

But then the "reds" started appearing. Not like BETTER DEAD THAN RED in the communist since, but sorta maybe yeah because people said that exact same phrase but instead about color subversives. Anyways, the reds were, like, super into color. So yeah, you guessed it, we blew everything up again.

Some superhumans re-emerged. I guess they discovered some underground mutant lab or something and started tinkering. So there were a few millenia where they were running stuff. Honestly, outside of the death camps that time was pretty okay. We even managed to get back into space for a bit.

But then the space dudes totally flipped out and revolted because they weren't getting enough space bucks for mining the asteroid or something so they dropped an asteroid on us.

Pretty much zeroed us out again. One superchick managed make it through and then she built a cult for a while. I joined it. Superchick was hot. But she did this virginial messiah thing so it wasn't my jam. I split off and kind of just wandered the wasteland for a bit.

Big downside to immortality is boredom. I think the Chipotle god was all trying to teach me a lesson, and if that lesson was "boredom sucks" he totally nailed it. But I don't think that's what it way. Something about being "deprived of my humanity" and forced to be "lonely" for all time. Jokes on him since I'm big time on the introversion scale.

Like, back in the good ole 2000's, I wouldn't even follow someone around in the parking lot to try and get their space. It just felt like too intimate of a relationship to establish with someone to put my car somewhere.

Back to the main storyline. Boredom does indeed suck. And I was bored a lot. Especially since it seemed like humanity was on this super long and lame loop where we screwed it all up before we really got going. Finally, we went the distance. Became transplanet, then transystem, then we started to take a shot at the galaxy.

Some thoughts about all of that. First: no aliens. Not even life on another planet. Felt like a total rip off. Not sure what the deal is with that, but space is empty AF. So humanity went weird with it as usual. We got this big ole galactic empire going, we're talking height of power type of stuff. And then somehow it just melted all down, everything split all apart. And now everyone is all scattered and making up weird religions, and genetic forks and stuff.

At least I was vacationing on the Outer Rim when it went down. I got stranded, but the food is solid. Every few millennium an interstellar bridge gets established and someone from the species formerly known as humanity shows up, but it's always super cringey.

Like, humans are the aliens now. Because we're all isolated and stuff on all these different planets. One ship came through and all of the humans had like, slug tracks rather than legs. They were all slimy and goopy.

Sucks for them I guess. They couldn't have salt on their margaritas.

Worst that happened to me was I got a tan. A solid tan.

I was just settling in for a pretty chill afternoon beneath the glow of Vodka (I named the sun because I was super rich and bought the system from the Galactic Empire on a discount sale before the Outer Rim got popular) when Chipotle god showed up.

Dude was NOT amused. He was all comin' at me trying to gloat about having cursed me. And asked whether I had seen the folly of my ways. Preaching about the cost of my actions and the price of loneliness. Blah blah blah.

On the real? Totally forgot the dude existed until he popped into existence. So I asked him wtf he was talking about.

He got all furious and started yelling until finally, I was all: "Chipotle dude!"

And he was all: "Quetzalcoatl"

And I was all: "Yeah, that's what I said, Chipopipoatle."

Then he sees me all tanned and chilling on Vodka III and he's just getting super emotional about the whole situation. And I'm like: "How is this my fault? You gave me lemons and I made a Vodka planetary resort out of it."

After that, he says I'll be sorry and goes on about the heat death of the universe or something. I dunno, guy just seemed real butt hurt about it all.
