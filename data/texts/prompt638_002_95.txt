"Dammit Vigo, be quiet!"  
&nbsp;  

"We can't keep breaking into biotech nursery dumps Mark, we're gonna get caught."
  
&nbsp;  
Mark scoffed. "You have any better ideas? In our current state a child could rip off our arms and beat us with them. Trying to bite a live human would be a thousand times more dangerous, not to mention pointless."  
&nbsp;  

Vigo glared at Mark, but he knew it was the truth. The bio waste was the only way to get any kind of sustenance now that old age and sickness were eliminated by those damn scientists.  
&nbsp;  

"It's just..this suuuuucks."  
&nbsp;  

Mark rolled his eyes at the horrible pun and finally broke the code to the door. He motioned forward after pushing through the entrance. "Worry about that after we find some blood. I haven't had any in a week and I'm starting to get ashy a-"  
&nbsp;  

Mark trailed off as a fist blasted him in the chest. He flew backwards into the side of the next building, as Vigo spun around to see what happened. Out of the door stepped what appeared to be a fragile old woman.  
&nbsp;  

"You damn kids stay out of the dumpster! I'm tired of you taking all the burned out chips and trying to sell them as psychotics."  
&nbsp;  

Vigo ducked as the 'old lady' threw a bag of trash at his head, which exploded on the wall behind him and rained down disgusting biological fluids all over a dazed Mark.  
&nbsp;  

"Jesus lady calm down, we aren't kids we're just trying to-"  
&nbsp;  

"Trying to catch a beating! Get out of here!"  
&nbsp;  

~~  
&nbsp;  

Mark and Vigo dragged themselves into their studio apartment in the basement of their dilapidated slum tower. Not having any biochips to augment their brain activity meant society deemed them too dumb to even service the fast food bots, so all they could afford was a dump.  
&nbsp;  

"Well, I snuck a bag of o-negative out of the crap she threw at me, so there's that," Mark grumbled. "Remember the 80s, Vigo? We were kings. Nothing could touch us. Computers still used floppy disks and humans were fresh sacks of meat walking around with no cellphones and no way to defend themselves, like cattle. What...happened?"  
&nbsp;  

"I should've bit Dr. Newton while he was still doing coke off of stripper asses and wearing leftovers from Michael Jackon's closet," Vigo growled. "Now he's cured every known disease, eliminated blood from the human body, and made our daily survival almost impossible."  
&nbsp;  

Mark nodded. "I knew eventually someone would figure out immortality outside of vampirism, but replacing blood with Diet Orange Fanta is not the route I hoped would be taken. And Cam Newton? Who knew he would get hit so hard on a blitz that it made him unlock his full brainpower."  
&nbsp;  

The pair sat drinking their blood in silence, wondering where the next meal would come from, and pondering how much longer they could last in this bloodless world of androids, machines, and accidental genius ex-quarterbacks for the Carolina Panthers.
