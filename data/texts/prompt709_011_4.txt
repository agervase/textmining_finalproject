“My husband?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Is dead?”
The kid in front of her shifted uncomfortably. “Yes ma’am. I’m really sorry for your loss, but you have to come with us, to identify and...stuff.” His voice trailed off as his eyes tried desperately to avoid hers.”

She glared at him, cocking one eyebrow. “Stuff?” “Yeah, I,” his face fell completely. “I’m sorry ma’am, I’ve never had to do this before. It’s usually just, like, parking tickets for me. I am really sorry, but you gotta go with me now.” He stared at the ground, his fluffy cheeks bright red.
“To identify my dead husband?”
“Yes!”
“That’s impossible.”
“But, why, do you need to like, go...?”

She shook her head in amusement. *Let the poor boy go*, she tried telling herself.
“No, it’s impossible because he isn’t dead.” To this the kid straightened up, almost smiling. “Aah! But, umm, he is. He uuh, had his license. And his face wasn’t messed up. I mean, everything else was, but not his...anyway, sorry! But yeah no, 123 Wisteria Drive, this is it.”

*Jesus Christ, police academy is not what it used to be.* “Uhuh. Look, sweety, it’s impossible because my husband is in the kitchen, so whoever you found in this...”
“Mexican stand-off.” 
“Right. Isn’t my husband. Go off to your chief or whatever and get this straightened out, yeah? I’m starving and his carbonara is insanely good. Bye!” With that she flung the door closed and walked to the kitchen. “Heya hun, what was that all about?”

She cocked her head, resisting the urge to flip him the bird. “Mexican stand-off?” He had the decency to blush. “Oh.” “Oh?” She walked into the kitchen and grabbed some plates. “Oh? Motherfucker, how hard is it to get rid of your old body once you die? Seriously, lye, acid, whatever, don’t just leave it there. With your goddamn license!”

“Yeah, that’s gonna be a bitch to explain at the DMV...”
