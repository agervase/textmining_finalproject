I knew the day was coming, but I didn't know what to expect. When I woke up on February 23rd, my bed looked different. The soft and comforting blue bed that I was used to had been replaced by a red one. I noticed the difference the second I woke up, but I was far too groggy for this difference to actually register. I looked around the room and noticed I was in a very nice house. There was a walk in closet full of shoes. Next to it was a beautiful bathroom with a glistening marble floors, a huge shower and a massive, porcelain bathtub. I stood up and the first thing I noticed was how tall I was. I looked down in awe of my height, and that's when I noticed I was black. I walked into the bathroom and I immediately went to a mirror to see who I might be. I saw Lebron James looking back at me. My heart sank. I blinked and when I opened my eyes I was back to my old room. I screamed at the top of my lungs "Fuck!" Sitting in front of me was the noose  had fastened the night before. I had gone to bed unable to go through with killing myself, but after seeing the beautiful home Lebron James had and then being forced back into my shitty apartment almost immediately reawakened my desire to end it all. Being Lebron for just a minute reminded me just how insignificant I really was. Why did it have to be someone so recognizable?!" I implored a higher power that I had lost faith in long ago. I had hoped that when the day of the switch came I could enjoy life as someone with talent for far longer than that fleeting moment as Lebron. I grabbed a step stool and placed it below where the noose hung. I stepped up on the stool, ready to end it all.
