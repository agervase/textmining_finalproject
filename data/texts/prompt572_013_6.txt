"Tell me son, why do you want to know?" Me, trying to avoid answering after realizing something is tricking my fatherly sense.

"I'm just being curios." The boy answered, or whatever it is supposed to be.

"Hi just being curios, I'm dad!"

The boy face turns blazingly hot red, while yelling "ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!" It suddenly let out a black smoke with a sound of burning fuse. Both of the eyes pop, and every bit of hair are on fire.

"Seems like you manage to find the kill switch."  Somebody says while walking towards me.

"General Soap! What makes you come to my house all of sudden?" General Soap, the man who was entrusted with many of my invention when I was working with the defence department.

"You see Joseph, the Artificial Intelligence that you have create 5 years ago has manage to hack the military factories and create an Android version of itself. It also create an army of spy in which we still have not known of what their motives are." 

"I personally choose to monitor you closely once I heard that you suddenly have a 5 year old son, knowing that you just got married a year ago." The General said with a concerning voice.

"Well it seems like I manage to destroy it." I proudly claim.

"Yes you are. We have been doing month of research on how to destroy it, yet from the report that I have just got from our IT department, it seems that that thing can't handle dad jokes. The system doesn't know whether to laugh, get mad or pretend to confuse. It just output every emotion available and well, the system becomes overloaded and explode" General Soap explained.

"From what I remembered, so can't you, General"

The General, face-palming himself, said " Now I remember why we insist on giving you early retirement"
