Jeanne got up slowly, his knees aching from being on the stone for so long. He had been in the temple for nigh on 50 hours now, praying for the intercession of a God to help him. He knew that those who didn't have a holy sponsor almost always died immediately upon a succession crisis, and those who didn't never lived past the first round. With his father in failing health and his brothers and cousins almost all having a sponsor already, he knew he was screwed if someone didn't help him. While he doubted he was prominent enough (or interesting enough) for a God like Zeus or Odin to intercede for him, he thought he might be able to get someone like Astraeus or Frey to do so. However, his thoughts were interrupted by a loud *boom* that knocked him off his feet. He looked up and only saw smoke and rubble. A masked man walked out of the carnage and aimed a flintlock pistol at him. "Gaius sends his regards." The assassin said, cocking the hammer. Before he could fire however, Jeanne was already on his feet. He ran at the man and stabbed him with a ritual dagger in the gut. He drew the knife towards his heart and plunged it deeper. To make sure he was dead, he picked up the pistol that had been knocked out of his hands when Jeanne ran into him, and shot him in the head. He heard the hooves of a horse clacking on the stone in front of him, and turned to face another possible threat.

The horse itself was deathly pale, and was so skinny Jeanne could see its ribs. The rider had a dark black cloak, almost the color of coal. He had a scythe on his back, and his irises were blood red.  The rider, almost as if he read Jeanne's mind, knew he was worried, and spoke up.

"It is time you met your sponsor. I am Thanatos."
