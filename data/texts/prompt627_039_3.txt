The door to the dragon's lair slams open, "I, Sir Wiliam the handsome knight have cometh to slay this wretched fire breathing beast, to save you princess so that I may be your prince!" The prince standing across a bridge looking at the princess standing behind the Dragon. The princess brings down her red hood, revealing her big nose, buck teeth, and long ears shouts back "Oh! How brave of you Sir handsome knight William! Thank you for coming to save me! Please do hurry!" The knight cringes at the revealing of her appearance, now reluctant to save the princess, but remembers the rumor of the princess being the only child of a very wealthy foreign king, who is near the end of his life. If the knight can put up with her appearance he will be prince and soon afterward take over as king.

Shaking off the dreadful image of the princess kissing him, replacing with it an image of him with a king's crown. Sir William charges across the bridge with a courageous battle cry. **CRUNCH!* and that was it, the dragon has crushed the knight with one swing of it's fore claw and picks him up and eats him.

Once again the door to the lair slams open, is it another challenger? So soon? The silhouette reveals a large figure resembling a man with large round armor and horns on it's helmet. The figure slowly starts walking forward... "Donkey! Are you and Fergie luring knights again??"

"Shrek! What are you doing? I'm expecting a few more challengers today!"

"Donkey, you can't keep luring knights here and killing them!"

"Look Shrek, my baby girl needs to eat! As a man, I'm doing what I must to provide for her! Plus I'm ridding this world of disgusting men who are greedy, shallow, and in it for just the rich and fame! I'm the real hero here Shrek! Plus, I'm getting a lot of great loots! Check out this sword... Excali... something Fergie scratched off. I can pawn these off and my put my kids through school!"
