Ever since the Council of Watchmen (no, they don't see why every new Chrono laughs at the name) first discovered and stabilized the bubble-universes, there's been a contest: who can kill Hitler the best?

Sure, it seems like a pointless game; after all, the first to kill Hitler would be the only one who got to, right? After all, any observed events are locked automatically, to prevent a breach of Rule 1.

Turns out, though, the bubble universes I talked about are weird. They are small splits in the main Yggdrasil corridor, little bubble universes accounting for slightly different properties of the period between 1941 and 1944. In some, Anne Frank was never found, in others, Hitler successfully captured Moscow.

And it's in these pockets that we compete.

We're scored on everything from difficulty of our particular bubble, to creativity in the actual murder bit, to whether or not we were observed (and believe it or not, unobserved isn't necessarily better). Some of the highlights of the early champions were the man who disguised himself as the corpse of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the lady who talked Eva Braun into killing her boyfriend, and the man who put acid in Hitler's shoes.

When I finally got greenlighted to compete, I was thrilled. I'd been planning this for a long time, and I knew I'd score in the top 7. I'd been given the paranoid-and-in-a-bunker scenario, which was rated an 11 out of the possible 13 in terms of difficulty, and nobody expected me to succeed.

How did I do it? The records don't do it justice. I took off all the landing precautions, landed in a branch of my bubble, around a fragmented Hitler. Then I led him into my actual scenario, and let him kill the other Hitler.

Then I killed him too, for good measure.

Had to burn the bodies, though. Would have been too many questions otherwise.
