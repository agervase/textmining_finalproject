“So you’re telling me you blew this month’s rent on a new entertainment system for the living room, and now you expect *me* to put it together?” My fist crinkles around the encyclopedia of an instruction manual that my darling husband tossed to me only moments prior.

“You know I’m no good at these slow, meticulous projects- not like you, sweetie,” His voice is muffled as he cowers behind the two rectangular boxes containing the puzzle pieces of another impossible piece of Ikea furniture. “Please put it together while I’m at work?” His eyes pop up from the side of the box, pleading and doe-eyed. 

I roll my eyes. “Okay fine. But I’m never letting you within a 20-mile radius of an Ikea again.”

He finally appears from around the boxes to plant a kiss on my cheek. “Thank you honey, I’ll see you after work,” he says, and just like that, I’m home alone with a 5 hour task ahead of me and a pathetic excuse for a ‘day off’.

“Bastard,” I say to no one. An intricate 3D model of the unit taunts me from the front of the instruction manual, its title embedded boldly beneath it. “Fä..jall, bo? What the hell does that even mean?” 

 I toss the book to the side and begin opening up the boxes, heaving out large pieces of wood and at least 10,000 tiny screws. By the time I have emptied the boxes I’ve broken a sweat and my noodle arms are screaming in defeat.
My cat appears from who knows where, purring as he weaves in and out of the piles of wood before rubbing his white face against the cardboard boxes. 
“Okay Joey, let’s get started,” I tell him, looking at the first set of instructions. 

**Clunk.**

*Thud.*

***Scrape.***

“Joey, get out of the box!” I yell over my shoulder, but I glance up to him sitting in front of me. With a gasp I whip my head around to see a face staring at me from inside the box. 

“Holy shit,” I choke, shoving myself backwards without taking my eyes off this -- *thing.* An uglier version of Rumpelstiltskin stares back at me, with tiny nubs of horns protruding from its forehead and crooked wings twitching behind its swollen face.

“What the fuck are you?” I breathe.

“Oh, sorry deary, didn’t mean to be rude,” It speaks with the voice of a garage disposal. The small creature struggles to lift itself over the side of the box, dangling for a few helpless seconds before falling to the carpet, rolling like an armadillo into a standing position. His naked, wrinkly body jiggles a hello.
“My name is Fjällbo,” It greets, "great demon of the Underworld, destroyer of all those that stand before me. A mercifulness warrior, a skilled soldier. And I have been summoned here -- well, about an hour ago. I do apologize for my lateness, navigating your world isn’t always the easiest,” It flashes me a toothy grin.

“You’re…a demon?” I gulp.

Fjallbo takes a step closer to me, its face contorting into madness, its unruly eyebrows arching into a sinister smile. “Oh yes deary, I am." It croaks. 

“What…what are you going to do to me?” My voice is barely a whisper, my body frozen in a fear I've never thought possible.

“Oh, I’m going to make you…*suffer*,” Its eyes darken as it takes a step further.

“You’re going to feel a pain you’ve...never felt before...” Another step. From here I can count every one of its dagger-sharp teeth.

“A pain…that you will surely...never forget.” It is mere inches from my face now, its sticky breath hot on my skin. It slowly reaches out its gleaming claws, and as quick as lightning it snatches a single screw before poofing out of existence. 

“NOOOOOOOOOO!” I wail, my body crumbling over into the fetal position.“DAMN YOU IKEA DEMON, DAMN YOU!”
