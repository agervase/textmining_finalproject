*So who will it be?* I was thinking in the moments I had to prepare. *My sister, whose early struggles I was oblivious to? My mother, who's already convinced she ruined me? My father, with his paternal anxiety? My brother, my best friend of childhood?*

"Wow. It'll never cease to amaze me how pretentious you can be."

I opened my eyes to the surreal sound of my own voice. There, standing in front of me, as if she'd always been there, was me. Seventeen, pale, strawberry blonde, fairly pretty...and with the very judgmental expression I always feared seeing from anyone and everyone else.

This is not what I thought would happen. *But...*

"This was inevitable, wasn't it?" I murmured.

She scowled. "Ugh, stop with the pretentious bull crap. The fact that you're not surprised is only a tribute to how narcissistic and arrogant you are, you little *clod."*

"Sorry," I had to say. My voice sounded broken to me. "I just wanted to understand myself."

The version of me across the way jabbed a finger in my direction accusingly. "*You're* the reason I never had any friends! *You're* the reason I got weird looks all the time! *You're* the reason I don't understand **the world!** YOU'RE THE REASON I'M *DEAD!*"

With every sentence, I flinched. It hit too close to home. But if she was acting like this, then... "Are...are you supposed to be like...my passive consciousness or something?"

Her expression of anger melted into one of horror. Her voice got quiet. "You... I don't believe you."

"W-what?"

"You're still doing it!" She turned and started walking away, but then she turned back again and walked right up to me, so close I had to take a step back. "*You're* supposed to be *my* pride," she said softly, angrily, poking me in the chest. "*You* shouldn't even *exist.* *You* are not *me,* but you took over my *life.* *You're* what makes life not seem worth *living.* But you're also the reason I was never suicidal, because that would just be *stupid,* wouldn't it? But that didn't stop you from ending my *life,* did it? I couldn't *move* when the time came." She lowered her voice even more, so it was dripping with hatred. Tears stung my eyes as she breathed, "You saw it coming, didn't you?"

I let out a sob. She stepped back, breathing heavily, and crossed her arms. "Well?"

I took a deep breath. This was it. I was speaking to what must have been essentially the *real* me, and she made me feel ashamed. What was I supposed to say? I'm sorry? I didn't mean it? I thought I was protecting us? You're right?

"I never wanted to hurt anyone," I finally said, lowering my gaze. "As a result, I never really did much with my life. I didn't go out, I didn't socialize... I didn't want to get close to anyone because I didn't want to turn into one of *them.* Someone normal who couldn't help but ruin lives and be petty over stupid things. I wanted to be better than them... I didn't want to hurt them by showing it. And I never really did hurt anyone, did I? Not significantly."

"No," she replied.

"I told myself it wouldn't matter if I did."

"You're a liar."

I swallowed. "I'm sorry."

She sneered. "You should be."

"I'm really sorry," I whimpered. "I ruined usâ€”I-I ruined *you."*

The other me closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them, I realized how dull they were. The usually bright, aquamarine irises were a dim grey that blended in with her pupils. She wasn't looking at me, I realized. She was looking through me.

With a sense of finality, she turned around and walked away, but not without throwing the final word over her shoulder. "I don't forgive you."
