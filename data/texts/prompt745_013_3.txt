"Look at this one.  They're called... In.. In-YEW-ehts?  In...yew... Inu-its.  Inuits.  They kiss each other by rubbing their nasal ridges together.  Aren't they sweet?"

"Mmm."

"Ha!  Look at these ones.  Jam... Jamay... Jamaicans...  These ones tend to gyrate to percussive rhythms generated by these smithed metallic instruments.  Fascinating, eh?"

"Mm?  Yes, yes.  Very nice."

"Ah hah hah!  Look at these things.  Bree-teesh.  These ones consume liquid dihydrogen monoxide mixtures steeped in mulched floral detritus.  Look at them protecting their queen!  So cute."

"Mnyuh-huh."

"Now THESE... THESE are my favorites.  Am... Ameri-kins.  These little guys apparently enjoy a rich culture of obsessing over these primitive ballistic tools and accruing biomass.  Look at this one.  And this one.  Three times larger than a typical Inuit."

"Right.  Are you ready over there?  Stop looking at those stupid things and ready your station, 5g]*u?4H?~_Q%np."

"But U3y}?=Ut4\Tm\}BB,... Wouldn't it be a waste to just eradicate all of these at once?  Perhaps we should save some, in the interest of ... I don't know... preservation?  Look at these ones!  A different species altogether, from what I can tell.  Cows."

"I could give a flying `z8y~qj.  Ready.  Your.  Station."

"How... How about this?  Instead of taking out this planet, let's just... I don't know... just take out all these other uninhabited planets?  There's nothing on these other ones.  Our directive does not specify that this planet in particular should be wiped.  I just want to preserve these things, U3y}?=Ut4\Tm\}BB.  I've never seen anything like these before."

"Ffffffffffff...ffffine.  But you... YOU'RE THE ONE to explain to Grand Facilitator /?\3yj35c.JPj@ why a planet was left over in this local group."

"Yeeeeeeee!  Thanks, U3y}?=Ut4\Tm\}BB!  You're the best!  Hear that, little guys?  You're going to be okay for 500,000 cycles while Uncle 5g]*u?4H?~_Q%np figures out how to get your biodiversity onto another planetoid in another system while we wipe this sector. :)"
