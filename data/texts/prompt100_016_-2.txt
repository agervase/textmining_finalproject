Once he had expertly whisked me inside,and his hidden partner had just as expertly frisked me, the smile dropped from my erstwhile "saviour"s face as swiftly as a whore who's realised there's no coin in your pouch - as suddenly as a Portcullis when you've passed through the curtain wall into the killing ground.

but only briefly did the mask slip, and the slip was deliberate, like a Wolf letting it's teeth show to disconcert the quarry at bay.

This was a man at home with deceit, earlier on his eyes had smiled as much as his lips, and his convincing slouch had concealed a body hardened by long hours with blade and spear, just as his foppish brightly coloured leather riding gloves, once discarded had revealed a pair of callused, scarred hands.Hands that had seen their fair share of violence it must be said... Kinda like my own.

So! he cried, "Sit sit sit, make yourself comfortable, lets have some wine, Lentrian red, not that muck you were swilling earlier!"

I was more than willing to sit, fact is my arse wanted to divorce me and marry the chair I was ushered into by his partner, a man so bland in feature that if he stood still he started to fade into the bricks behind,he was "around" as in "around 6 feet", "around 90 kilos" , and "kinda" as in he "KINDA" had a beard, it was "kinda" reddish brown, his eyes were "kinda" blue-ish grey.The only solid thing I could say was he "Kinda" had a Knife on his belt that was "Around" the size of a Sword, and it looked sharp and heavy,

its look of well used solidity a jarring note of grounded reality in a man so otherwise unnoticeable...a perfect assassin I realised with a start.

"Ahem! I hedged desperately, soooo, not that I WAS in fact using Magic...but what IS the punishment for using...Magic in your beautiful Kingdom?"(please don't say execution please don't say execution please don't say execution please don't say execution!)

I maintained a pleasant smile and firm eye contact as my bowels dissolved beneath me...

"Well...Jamie(for t'was the name of my saviour/captor) said...here's the thing"
