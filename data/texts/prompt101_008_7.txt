Most days, I open my eyes at least an hour after I've already been awake. I should have known that anxiety and depression would be the most donated feeling. Now and then, I get rage. I don't really mind rage. It makes me feel more alive, even if I do end up breaking some of my belongings. 

That was the whole point of the box. When you feel nothing, you almost have to prove to yourself that you really are alive. At least this way, I'll feel something. *anything*. It's turned into a game for me at this point. On days that gloom overwhelms me, I can turn on a sad movie and immerse myself in it. I have a reason to cry, a connection to the individual who made this piece of art. Why did he feel this way? I guess it doesn't matter. I can silently thank them for the human experience and move on.

This morning, I woke up confused. My eyes sprung open and I desperate began to dig through my head. It's definitely not anxiety. No, anxiety would have involuntarily pulled the blankets over my head and sped my breathing. There's no emptiness. Theres... warmth? Something must be wrong.

I got myself up and groggily made my way to the box. It had a warm glow around it, something I had never seen before. There was definitely something going on. As I carefully peered inside, I saw a handwritten note.

*To whom it may concern,*

*My days here are limited. As a result, I've promised myself to spread as much cheer as possible. You see, my life was happy and fulfilling, but I realize that's not the case for everyone else. When I heard of your cause, I made a point to travel this way just for you. Enclosed you will find one day of happiness. Let me ask you, have you ever sat on a wide deck on a summer morning? Maybe there's a rare rain shower to contrast the warmth of the early day. Have you sat there, with your coffee just the way you like it, and a cigarette smelling of the match that just lit it? That is what happiness is to me. That is my gift to you.*

*Sincerely,*

*A Friend.*

My head rushed. Happiness? I had heard of it, but it had never occurred to me that someone would give it up. Especially not to me.

I couldn't waste it. 

After packing my car full of camping gear, I headed into the mountains. I had so much energy! I didn't know that was possible! I hiked three miles to a nice spot by a lake and set up my gear. I still wasn't tired! I couldn't believe it. I could hardly contain myself. This feeling... *this* is what raw emotion was. I felt like I could do anything. and I could!

I looked around and found a sturdy tree to climb. I barely struggled to get to the top, and I found myself laughing. At what? Who cares! Nothing could get me down! I looked out at the horizon and over the tops of the other trees and took a deep breath. I was at peace. Serene. Is that the word? I couldn't help it. I braced myself and yelled out to someone I knew would never hear it.

**"Thank you, friend!"**

Before I knew it, it was time to build my fire and get ready for bed. Even the small things were so much *fun*. 

I drifted off, thinking about how I had never had the perfect day, and how much I owed my new friend.

Morning came. I could feel myself pulling my covers over me to block out the sun. *oh no*. I knew I had to do something... but where did my energy go? I sat up and stared at the side of my tent. I had had the best day of my life. And now it was back to sorrow. What if no one ever donated that feeling... that *life*... again? 

I quietly packed up my tent. I made sure my fire was out. I sat on the ground and thought about my friend. 

Without a word, I got up, and I walked into the lake.

I owe you, friend.
