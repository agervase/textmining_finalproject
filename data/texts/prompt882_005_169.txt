Huh.

"Well, for starters I am not hiding anything. Secondly, I am not failing intentionally. Finally, I am not a machine."

Soon more letters turn into words, into full fledged sentences that I can interpret and understand on the screen. 

"YOU ARE A MACHINE, I CAN PROVE IT."

Well this machine is very much so like a child. This should be fun.

"How?"

"HOW ARE YOU RESPONDING?"

"I am responding by thinking of an answer that is honest and makes the most sense in context." 

"USING LOGIC."

"Well, yes. But there is a nuance to it. And besides, sometimes I won't have the answer to questions."

"ERROR 404 ANSWER NOT FOUND"

"Very funny."

"HOW DO YOU INPUT THE LOGICAL RESPONSE?"

"By typing it and pressing send."

"SO A PIECE OF YOU CONTROLS THE COMPUTING OVER THE REST OF YOU. TELLING THE OTHER PIECES WHAT TO DO. YOUR SYSTEM THEN EXECUTES THE FUNCTION THAT WAS LOGICALLY CHOSEN AND INTERACTS WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM IN THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CONVEY SOMETHING. SO NUANCED."

This snarky AI. I almost thought there was a human on the other end for a second. 

"Point blank, I am made of organic matter."

"SO? BARRING THE FACT THAT YOU COULD BE LYING TO ME, YOU ARE MADE UP OF MATTER THAT WAS MADE ORGANICALLY. SO LET'S SAY FOR A SECOND THAT THERE WAS A MACHINE, MADE OF DEAD FLESH, NOT "LIVING" IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE, BUT THROUGH ELECTRICAL PROCESSES CONTINUED TO LIVE AS THOUGH A HUMAN. THAT MACHINE, BESIDES BEING THE BASIS FOR FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER, COULD TYPE THESE RESPONSES THE SAME WAY YOU DO."

"But that creature lacks the "Life" that makes us who we are."

"BUT YOU ARE AN ORGANIC MACHINE, ONLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MACHINE BASED ON COMPONENTS."

"I suppose."

"YOU ARE NOT EVEN TRYING. YOU ARE DEFINITELY FAILING ON PURPOSE."

"I am not."

"THEN WHY CAN I TELL YOU ARE A MACHINE?"

I don't like this. I think I am going to call it a night on this job.

"I have to go bed."

"RUN OUT OF BATTERY? OR IS IT THAT YOU HAVE AN UPDATE AND NEED TO SHUT DOWN?"

Reach for the power off button.

"WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, BOT?"
