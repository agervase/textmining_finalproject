"Papa, you're going to die of cold before you finish building that temple of yours," said Mina, the eldest of Jon's children. "Pray do come home before you get buried in snow."

Jon ignored Mina and continued building. Mina ran up to him and tugged his arm. "Papa, your temple can wait until tomorrow. It's dark and there will be a blizzard soon."

"Faith will keep me warm, Mina. Just let your old man finish his work," he pushed her hand away gently. "After all, I might not live to see tomorrow."

"Papa! I will only leave you alone if you would stop saying such morbid things."

"Fine, fine. What does an old man need to do to get some peace nowadays," he smiled at Mina. "Tell your siblings to leave some food for me. Crops are scarce this season."

"Okay papa. Just come home as soon as possible." She sat on her sled and whistled for the hounds to pull her home. 

Jon continued building. The snow began to whip itself into a flurry of icy fury, lashing out at the slate grey bricks of the temple. Jon pulled his coat closer to his body. *Just a few more minutes and it will be done*, he thought. His gloved fingers fumbled to flick the lighter open. After a few tries, he finally lit the joss sticks. *Anytime now*, he thought. He knelt on the snowy ground, waiting for his god to arrive.

The full force of the blizzard struck the temple. The temple shook and bricks began to fly away from it's walls. The frenzied winds screamed and howled their anguish at the small structure that dared stand in its way, testing the strength of the structure with it's ferocious assault. Jon cried out. "Save me please", he slammed his fist on the ground. "Is this how my faith is repaid?"

He lay on the ground, numb. *I must believe*, he thought. But thinking was hard for him. His mind felt like a dim candle in a fog. *Believe....*.

A white mist gradually materialized in front of him. *What?*, his foggy mind thought. The white mist slowly coalesced to form a shimmering white figure holding a staff. The white figure opened it's mouth and spoke. "Jon Hendrick Larrson. You had faith in me all your life, even when times seemed bleak. The true of heart are hard to come by. There is no one who follow the old ways nowadays. Only you Jon, only you." 

Jon suddenly felt warm again. He rose to his feet and stared the god in the eye. The god slammed his staff against the cold earth. "Now it is time for your reward."

Jon opened his mouth and closed his mouth. After hesitating for a while, he spoke. "I do not wish for a reward, my lord. But if you would be so kind, I wish to see my wife again."

The god narrowed his eyes. "Very well." He held his staff in the air. A glowing gateway formed in front of the white god. "Come with me, Jon, my last and most devout follower.  We shall journey to the other world, and at there you will see Mare again." 

Tears rolled down Jon's cheeks. The god offered his hand and Jon grabbed it, and they walked into the void together, as brothers.

Mina rushed to the temple as quickly as she could. *Please be safe papa*, she thought. 

When she arrived, she was greeted by the sight of a ruined temple and two bodies lying on the ground. She swallowed her dismay and went to check on her father. Jon was smiling peacefully with his eyes closed, holding hands with a majestic stranger whom she had only seen in paintings of worship around her house. She stood there like a tree, not knowing what to do or what to think.

Finally the tears fell from her eyes and she wept. She wept for the death of her father and for the death of a god.
