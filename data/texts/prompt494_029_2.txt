"Well, must be quite a hassle when people resist."

**Quite** 

I jump back from the arc of Death's scythe, keeping my back leg bent and my weight forward.
"So I don't suppose you'll let me off easy?" I cock a grin as I gesture with my sword an dagger.

**probably not**

Death starts to swing his scythe again.

"A pity"

I lunge forward inside of his reach, he pulls the scythe in to reap me in its blade but I catch it with my dagger and press all my weight into my sword as I thrust it through his rib-cage.

Now, you may be wondering if one can just go stabbing death. The answer, unsurprisingly, is no. That would be silly wouldn't it? just stab death and live forever? No, but he doesn't much like it and I ain't giving up easy.

My sword passes through him as easy as air, and in good sequence the rest of me follows as I sprint down the boulevard. Knocking over a food cart for good measure, because whats a chase if you don't knock something down? And if this is my last chase its gonna be a good one dammit. I leap and bound past people as the pants I pilfered the night before, being clearly out of shape, struggle to keep up. Death on the other hand seemed to be having no issue, I caught several glimpses of him as I passed alleys so I quickened my pace. Realizing that running overland like this was a fools attempt (and a quite boring one at that) I quickly dove trough the nearest window. I landed on a small child's birthday dinner, but with no time I sprinted of again with some new passengers of mashed potatoes and frosting stowing along. 

I made a quick exit, bursting out the homes backdoor into the street, and nearly into Deaths arms. A simpler man would have perished then, but a simple man I am not. Indeed I have often been described as a complex rat and take that title very seriously. Unable to arrest my momentum I threw my sword into the ground at Deaths feet. Death cocked his head at this action.

**What are-**

 I stomped on the blade catapulting the manhole cover into Deaths face and laughed as I vanished into the sewer. I ran through the sewer for hours. My pants finally gave up and I let them have a rest, but I kept on running. My heart was pounding and my muscles screaming but I pushed on at full speed until at last I saw a light. I sprinted out of the outlet into the daylight, and found Death in a lounge chair sipping a fruity looking drink.

**are you quite done?**

Panting and wishing my pants had been more athletic I collapsed.

"alright, I tried."

Death set his drink down gently and folded up his chair before approaching me.

"So, what even was it anyways, what took me?"

This I shall always remember, the last sound my mortal ears heard will reverberate through my soul for all eternity.

**overexertion**
