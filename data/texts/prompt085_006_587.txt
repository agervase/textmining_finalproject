"Actually, I'll take Italian bread this time." Derek said to the cashier. The little voice in the back of your head said "5". "Huh", you thought. "That's a little high for" "billion", the voice finished. You dropped your sandwich, the once beautiful Italian bread now forever tainted by the microbes inhabiting the public floor. 

"What the *fuck*" you mutter under your breath as you leave Jimmy Johns. You don't bother to get another sandwich.

Nathan walks down the street. "Tonight" he thinks to himself. A radical who saw evil in the very existence of humanity. His plan had been in the works for years. A brilliant hacker, Nathan had been sneaking trojans on the phones of government officials, waiting for one to finally slither its way to the intended destination. "When the dust settles, maybe Earth would eventually return to a more natural state" hoped Nathan.

He had finally gained access to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Tonight, he would set it free. It would cleanse the world of the filth and corruption of mankind with beautiful fusion, as pure as the sun.

As Nathan walked down the street, on the way back to his apartment, he was nearly knocked over when a bewildered man sprinted into the sidewalk from within Jimmy Johns. "Scum!" Shouted Nathan. Derek didn't even notice.

Anger gripped the entirety of Nathan's consciousness. Still glaring at the man who'd almost toppled him moments earlier as he receded into the distance "you'll die tonight, cockroach" Nathan thought of the man. "So many other despicable and insignif" Nathan's thought was cut short as he slipped on a spot of black ice. Too busy fuming at the strange man who'd bumped into him, he had not been paying attention to where he'd been walking. "Shit!" He shouted involuntarily as he fell into the street. A mere moment later, he was smote by a passing snowplow.

Derek would never know what happened.
