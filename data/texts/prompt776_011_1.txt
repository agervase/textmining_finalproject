A cat named Jack gave me a scratch

He woke me up from my long nap

he told me to follow him out back

I followed his scruff to the stream.

He leapt right in after a fish

I couldn't jump, I'm such a bitch,

instead I bellyflopped and flipped

headfirst into the shallow stream.

I came out on the other side,

the water took me for a ride,

I held my tongue to keep some pride

and Jack let me pet his chin.

The air was cold the wind was rough

the water filled each gap in my lungs,

the fish all glowed like morning sun,

but Jack never lost his gaze.

I swam so fast to keep on up,

but then a shark had reared its butt

and poor old Jack had swung his foot,

but man was it far too late.

He lost a leg, I lost an arm,

he told me not to give alarm,

the blood was bad enough so far,

just follow the light down the way.

He pointed down to guide our slump,

the shark was coming up to munch,

we almost made it, it was tough,

I held onto my breath for days.

We patched our wounds when we got through,

the sunset sang a pleasant tune,

but Jack bled out and spoke a truth,

he told me I was lost on my way.

I wandered in this place for days,

where trees grew small and dogs lay eggs,

I saw no people on my way

to the light that Jack once knew.

Instead I wandered day and night,

my stomach roared it gave me frights,

I grew a tail from mushroom bites

and my arm was replaced with a peg.

I seemed to lose track of the time,

but one dark day I saw the light,

the same one Jack's paw saw through night

and I followed it for a long way.

It led me back into a room,

I saw a man who looked like you,

he sang a song and danced a toon,

he told me to be on my way.
