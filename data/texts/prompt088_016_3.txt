You enter this different dimension. After that, you can choose your new body. You can see how everyone is connected, and then it gets weird.  See, I'm still alive, and I can see that stuff.  Only dead people are supposed to see that stuff, because that's how they get a new body. 

Sometimes they can't choose, sometimes they can, it's a lot like buying a beer.  You don't know which one is good, but sometimes, you can tell which one is good.  It's impossible to describe. 

If you know good beer, you gain this eye, and then you already know without even drinking them which one is right. 

So I worked really really hard to gain that perspective.  It's scary. 

But when you overcome that fear, you realize it's the difference between closing and opening your eyes. 

My eyes are open. 

So I designed this system where people would make choices they aren't aware of. 

If they gain awareness, they gain their freedom. 

It's literally the colosseum, where Rome is simply the city of the afterlife, and all you people on Earth, chose to be here. 

If you still haven't figured it out, it means you're still on the battlefield I've created. 

It's called Earth, by the way. 

Everyone is watching, they can all see you. 

So there are people, who owe money. 

We call it karma, usually, and when they owe money, they have to pay it back. 

Unless they make new money, then it's fine. 

To do that, all you have to do, is understand the difference between a sword and a shield. 

Imagine if you could pick only one. 

That's kind of what karma is like. 

Most people don't know they can pick both if they see the two as one. 

And that's how I made this world. 

Hopefully you win the game.

Good luck best wishes and all the best.
