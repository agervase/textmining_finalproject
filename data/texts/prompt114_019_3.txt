It is not often I come across a name I don’t recognize. At least, not anymore.

“Fhyra.” 

I don’t make a habit of calling people by their names unless they choose to reveal it to me. My ‘talent’ has put me in sticky situations before. But this name was truly unique, and touched me in a way no other name had before. It’s enchanting.

“Fhyra,” I mutter again, to myself. I enjoy the way it rolls off my tongue.

The woman next to me with her cart of herbs and spices all but freezes. One of the wheels squeals as it comes to as stop. It is a sharp and painful sound, preluding a momentary yet eternal silence. 

I didn’t have to make eye contact to feel her cold gaze peering into me. Nonetheless, I meet it. She is strikingly pale. Ghostly, even. Dark eyes flecked with orange root me where I stand. She’s thin, her jawline narrow and smooth. She is…. well, captivating. Silver hair hangs around her neck, tucked away under the collar of her long coat. My eyes long to follow the strands down, but I find I am held fast.

“Where, oh where did you learn that name child?” Her velvety voice is calming, but there is a sharpness to it, something sinister.

Her question pierces me in a way I don’t understand. I try to deflect. I’m quite good at deflecting. I already have an answer I think will put her at ease. Instead, I blurt out the truth. I can’t explain why. I’ve told no others about my secret.

“I am gifted with knowledge of your name, and everyone else’s for that matter.”

An amused half-smile creeps onto her delicate features.

“You speak a tongue that is not your own. You would be wise to remain silent now. Come with me.” 

Her words grow softer, yet fall heavily upon my ears. *Come with me*. They are intoxicating. I hear them again, as if on a loop. *Come with me*. I’m sure that is exactly what I need to do now. *Come with me*. I must. As my vision clouds and my hearing deafens, I squint and attempt to lean closer. I try to keep her in my sight, try to hear her once more….
