"I'm cold."  He murmurers the words.  His strength is all but spent, his breath is ragged and labored.  It won't be long.


"I know."  The only response I can give.  There is no comfort I can offer, no way for me to stall what is in motion- has been in motion for what feels like an eternity, but in the face of eternity, life- even such a long life- is just a flickering candle.  In the end there is always the cold- one of the last comforts for the dying.


"Can you sit closer to me?" There is fear and sadness, such immense sadness in his voice.  We have known each other for an eternity.  He seemed invincible only a short while ago, vibrant and indomitable- but now I see the mere act of existing drain him.


"Of course."  I sit next to where he lies prone, and take his hand, interlacing my fingers with his.  


"I wish we had a little longer."  As he says it, I laugh.  I followed him from the very beginning.  When he surged through oceans, and soared through the skies.  I was just behind him the entire time he danced among the stars.  Every place he went I was never far behind.  I walked in his footsteps, and coveted each of his works.  I know he didn't make them for me, but for their own sake, for the art itself.  But, among all that ever was, his oeuvre stands above it all- beautiful, poignant and fleeting.  I loved it all, but more than that I loved him.  I loved what he made, and loved him for making it.  I loved that he did it knowing- knowing that I would one day see each thing in turn, and on that day it would be no more. 


I don't have any more words for him.  There aren't enough words to say all that I feel: for him, and for what he has done, what he has made- and in it's making, given my own time fullness and meaning.  All the joy and sadness I feel in this moment, if I could stretch it out across eternity, I would only scratch the surface of what I feel with words.  


I lean in closer.  He breaths in.  


I kiss him for the first time- for the last time.  


He breaths out.


And I am cold.
