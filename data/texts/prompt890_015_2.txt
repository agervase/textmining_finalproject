*(French, first time, apologies. Corrections  & Tips appreciated. Have fun)*

He was doing this over and over. Same words. For like half an hour. Not an ounce of change.

I tried to act like the average mind-blind person and focused on my business lunch. And damn these can last so long. 

I trained for that but never more than a few minutes.  Not on purpose of course. Not like I need it. But it happens from  time to time  in public transports. Kids having fun. Nerds trying to bust psychics to boost their ego. No big deal.

&nbsp;

But this. I can hear him so distinctly. So clearly. People usually don't think that much while they eat. It's not as loud as the non-psychic think it is. But he **is** loud. He **is** annoying. 

I'm not sure how he can make his voice surround the ambiant noise like that.

I'm not sure how I'm gonna take it for one more hour. 
I'm gonna need a break soon.


&nbsp;

All I know is he's not moving. I estimate him between five and ten meters away from me. I don't know why this voice sounds familiar.

Something just hit me. Something I should have noticed way sooner. The pace. So mechanical. That was akwardly regular. The exact same amount of time between each thought. I counted ten seconds. For a moment I wondered if I was listening to a human voice.

&nbsp;

"Medium steak and french fries please ?"

I was so focused I didn't see the waitress coming.

"That's mine thanks" I replied as I turned my head to a very charming young lady.

She was standing still. Something about her eyes turned my blood to ice instantly. I got a deep gut feeling that something was very wrong.

I saw my colleagues look at me with a concerned look.

&nbsp;

"John, who are you talking to ?"

&nbsp;

What I felt next was a life first. My pretty little world of secrets just collapsed in my head. It was like free falling on myself and my guts were the ground I crushed on every second.

She was still here. Staring at me. It felt like she could read my soul and go back until I was born.

I checked the steak and fries. I laughed on the inside. Like it mattered.

&nbsp;

My colleagues started thinking

*What's the matter with him*

*Damn he's crazier than I thought*

*He's so sexy when he's like that. If only he could notice me*

*He's more white than a ghost*

&nbsp;

In other circumstances I would have double checked which girl just thought that sexy thing but I had a more urgent matter right now.

My mind got stuck on the last one. "A ghost".

&nbsp; 

The shadow. Whoever she was, she had no shadow.

I decided to ignore her.

&nbsp;

"Sorry I don't feel so well. Got a short  night. And I'm starving so much I just heard my command outta nowhere."

&nbsp;

"Haha yeah I'm a psychic too when I'm hungry."

&nbsp;

Dave just earned friendship points.

The most stupid excuse just worked thanks to the most silly ass co worker I ever got. My little world of secrets got shook a lot but it remained intact after all.

&nbsp;

"Now can you stop freak me out and eat, dickhead ?" Dave said while throwing peanuts at me.

&nbsp;

I laughed to that just to ease the situation. That was the more unnatural laugh I ever uttered, but that was the best I could do.

The waitress was not here anymore.

I didn't really notice when the mechanical voice had stopped. I actually had a short night and maybe I'm really more tired than usual.

Then it happened again.

&nbsp;

The exact same beautiful young woman came over. I took me a lot of efforts to ignore her again. Her voice was slightly different.

&nbsp;

"Hey Johnny I thought you were starving. You ordered steak and fries right ?" Dave said.

&nbsp;

What. The. Heck.

I looked at my colleagues waving heads at me and at the waitress like "Sorry miss he's not the brightest one".

Except for Sarah. I was shining in her eyes in any occasion. How did I never notice that before ?

So the exact same waitress was standing in front of me. And everyone could see her.

&nbsp;

"Your steak and fries, Sir." She said.
"Thanks" I gulped.

&nbsp;

As I took my plate I saw the waitress's doppelganger come again. At this point I was so lost I decided not to decide anything until I see more.
The same death look froze my soul. She stopped right next to her living sibling. No one seemed to notice her. Then she leaned on her ear and whispered something that cut my breath for what seemed an infinite amount of time : 

&nbsp;

"I know you're listening". Then she vanished.

&nbsp;

I was in total shock. Then the real waitress fainted. Maybe the next second. Maybe the next minute. I have no clue.

&nbsp;

A man in a long raincoat crouched to take her pulse and shook his head like there was nothing to do.
He covered her with his coat. First thing I thought was I liked his clothes. 

How silly. Someone died. I saw a ghost. And I'm just in awe for a stranger's clothes. Dave is right. I'm batshit crazy. Beyond normal.

&nbsp;

The clothes. I know why I like them.

&nbsp;

"Hey John"

&nbsp;

I knew this voice. I heard it for half an hour. I was paralyzed. My brain told me to run but my fear was clutching my feets to the ground with the weight of my cowardice.

&nbsp;

The man rose and turned at me. That was me. My own double. The clothes I was wearing today. He had the same empty look as the ghost waitress. I died inside.

&nbsp;

He walked to me. Slowly. He leaned at my hear. I don't remember when I started shaking.

"I know you're listening"

&nbsp;

I wake up alone in the empty restaurant. No lights.

A flash of burning light blinds me as I hear restaurant noises for a second.

Then the night again.

I'm so lost. I'm remembering the last events. These make absolutely no sense. And no way to remember who I saw after the waitress fainted.

Another blight of light. The sounds again.

&nbsp;

Wait. Was that ten seconds ?
