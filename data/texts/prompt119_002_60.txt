It was 2012 all over again. Except this time, it was for real.

The world was always a constant cycle of war, cooperation, chaos, and harmony. It was the circle of life, 
both good and evil coexisting with one another.

And after centuries of constant repitition, it seems the end has arrived.

The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse were here. There was nothing to be said. Streets were full of people, murmurs here and there,
silence from others, but one thing was clear: deliverance was here. The world was waiting, and nothing could prepare them for what was to come after.

Just as the sky turned dark when the 4 Horsemen arrived, suddenly, there was a blinding flash of light. Everyone either
covered their eyes or turned away. And when the blinding light passed, there was a collective of gasps, as they saw what, or rather
who, had appeared.

Mr. Rogers, Jim Henson, Steve Irwin, and Bob Ross, were all standing at the side opposing Pestilence, War, Famine, and Death.
It was both a confusing scene and a sight to behold. 4 people who were loved by the world, children and adults alike, stood together in a side that radiated life and hope.

For the next hour, people were taking pictures, talking, crying, making noises, and making a sense of what was going on. All of a sudden, the atmosphere
began to tense, literally everyone stopped what they were doing. In the sky above them, nothing has changed, with two sides opposing each other,
one side brighter than the other. But something else was coming that stopped people from making a movement or a sound. 

As if things couldn't get any more confusing, an opera started singing from the heavens, accompanied by what could be described as a modern hip-hop beat,
then the clouds parted and a voice boomed from the heavens...

*EEEPPIIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORYYYYYYY* 

*WAR, PESTILENCE, FAMINE, DEATH*

*VS*

*MR. ROGERS, JIM HENSON, STEVE IRWIN, BOB ROSS*

*BEGIN*

[Pestilence]    
*Ugh! I'm sick of seeing these brats, appeal to people on TV    
Paint a portrait of a frog falling ill to children who are unruly    
Watch your neigbors succumb to sickness Rogers,    
like your cancer brought you to your death    
I'll watch them all writhe and cry to the heavens    
as they breath their last breaths*

[War]    
*Bloodshed for all! Bloodshed all!    
Cries of warriors as ashes, dirt and bodies shall fall!    
Raining blood from the skies, blasting metal for the soul    
Blast beats, distortions, and the cookie monster growl!    
Children will cry for their parents, like Steve's did when he died    
Keeping them awake from predators, while consumed by fear at night*

[Famine]    
*The animals will compete for food, isn't that so, Steve?    
These social animals are so lucky, their foolishness they can't conceive    
It will hurt more than a sting to hear I'll make them all extinct    
By pitting one against the other, I'll drive population loss to its brink*    

[Death]    
*After all's been said and done, Bobby's paintings are all trash    
Renaissance artists revolutionized, while his landscapes are just crass    
Your puny 4 shows and lives can't compare to my consistency all year round    
And I continued while your's died when you four where nowhere to be found*    

[Mr Rogers]    
*I'd call you neighbors but it seems that you four don't look all too friendly    
What a shame for you beings to appear in front of many looking so unsightly    
Why frighten and confuse when you can all play horse racing instead    
And give the children a future, to which they all can look to ahead*    

[Steve Irwin]     
*Alright mates, first of all, you don't seem to be treating those horses right    
And second, you're probably the worst animals I've seen in my entiiire life    
Rather than approach, I'll let my bars do the talking    
Fear the venomous drip when my fangs sink in without you knowing    
That it takes mere seconds for you to walk home in shame    
Migrating back to where you came from knowing your efforts went all in vain*

[Bob Ross]    
*You never really were the subjects that I aimed to paint in life    
I aim to spread beauty and happiness , rather than repulsiveness and strife   
See for yourself, the awareness I spread in my lessons from the start    
You'll be the first, I would have to truly give a failing mark*

[Jim Henson]    
*The world will no longer be fooled by you, while you act as puppetmasters    
Famine, war, death and pestilence-*    
[Kermit]: *always takes out the laughter*    
[Jim] *With only 1 out of the 3 to be the most accepted of natural order    
The kids will keep on learning from the Muppets, as they always have    
About how they can choose to love and care-*    
[Kermit]: *as well as share and laugh*

&nbsp;

*WHO WON?!*    
*WHO'S NEXT?*    
*YOU DECIDE!*
