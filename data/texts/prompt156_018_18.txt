TRANSCRIPT OF VOTE DISCUSSION 2435.B-4

AT THE 32ND SESSION OF THE GALACTIC GENERAL ASSEMBLY

&#x200B;

<AMBASSADOR GHYZX> Representatives of the assembly, I come before you a humble servant of the USG. We have lived in harmony for eons, but now that harmony is threatened. Threatened by a race of lowers. A vulgar people who refuse to become in-tune with the universe, and instead use machines to warp it, bend it, hurt it, and make a mockery of all we hold dear. This vote is a vote to preserve the very peace that binds us all together. When their ships approached, we all felt the universal fabric.

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: anger  from multiple sources>        


&#x200B;

<UNKNOWN>  They’re forrest animals that don’t know their place!

<AMBASSADOR TYRQ> That’s enough of that! We will have order in these proceedings!

<GHYZX> Thank you prime overseer, but the sentiment is correct. There is a natural order to the universe. A hierarchy of beings based on their ability. If disconnects were allowed to change things to their will, chaos would ensue. Our entire civilization would crumble. Voting yes is the only moral and just option.

<TYRQ> Ambassador Comstak asked to speak and so will be allowed.

<COMSTAK> Should we not allow the humans to participate in these proceedings?

<TYRQ> Comstak, you are on a very short leash. I will not have disconnects participate in official meetings.  We wouldn’t teach a Czyrak to communicate and ask it to defend messing on the floor.

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: laughter>        


&#x200B;

<COMSTAK> We do not know what they are capable of. If they have mastered FTL without magic, who knows what weapons they have. Would it be not best to speak with them and avoid conflict?

<TYRQ> Their spirt cleaves as easy as any other. They should have stayed in that pit they call a solar system. I will not debate with servants who do not serve. And I do not debate with servants, so they have NO STANDING HERE!

<COMTAK> I have sources that say they are developing machines that can communicate via the substrate and that means…

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: shock and horror.>          


&#x200B;

… listening to this very gathering. This proposal is blasphemous. Who knows what effects it will have with our connection to the USG! Peace lead the way!

<MANY VOICES> Peace lead the way.

<GHYZX> Peace will always lead the way, but they do not lead with peace. They lead with machines. Machines! A toilet has a deeper connection to the universe.

<COMTAK> Would not a Soltrap be a better solution? Allow them the time to grow and learn.

<GHYZX> You do not quarantine a virus. You eradicate it.

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: general agreement>          


<COMTAK> My system will not be party to war!

<GHYZX> War assumes that one side can fight! We act quickly! We act now! Then we can be assured of the outcome!

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: 50% agree / 50% dissent>

&#x200B;

<TYRQ> We’ll take an official vote and see where we stand. All in favor mass cleave of the human race, say YEAH.

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: 55% YEAH>

&#x200B;

<TYRQ> Let the record show the majority of the assembly…

&#x200B;

***<SUBSTRATE SQUELCH>***

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: confusion>          


<GHYZX> By the universe! Was that them?

<TYRQ> Is that what a disconnect feels?

<COMTAK> It was only the gathering communications, but yes…

&#x200B;

***<SUBSTRATE SQUELCH>***

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: fear>          


<EARTH REPRESENTATIVE SINGH> Dear members of the galactic assembly. We have been able to review some of your history. When it comes to war, you seem to be out of practice. We have developed the ability to inhibit all communications. Earth would like to offer negotiations to prevent further escalation of hostilities.

&#x200B;

<QUANTUM NOISE: 100% YEAH>

&#x200B;

<SINGH> Accepted.
