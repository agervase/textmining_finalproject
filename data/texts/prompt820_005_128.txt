"Are you trying to tell me that this legendary weapon had been in my world, not once, not twice, but three times?" I asked the old man in disbelief.

With a heavy sigh he replied, "Yes, but when this Hall was created to only examine a warrior's prowess in battle, not their overall competence. That being said, you've only heard of one recorded account of this hammer in your world as a Viking Prince. The second warrior was set to conquer the Eastern world yet slept with a very obvious assassin. Thus died before he got going. Then the last one died of dysentery within a week of receiving the weapon. Once the gifted warrior has passed away however the weapon is returned here, which got that assassin I just mentioned killed as her contractor couldn't believe it just disappeared."

The Hall was immense, the vaulted ceiling was a dark abyss with no end in sight. Down both the left and right there were alcoves with weapons on pedestals. Long and short bows, katanas, bastard swords, and even exotic weapons that I knew not their names. Each was polished and looked as though it was placed right after being crafted. 

 *Ahh, finally...someone worthy.* 

"What did you say old man?" I snapped my head to the right and looked at him. In his dark green robe, he turned to me.

"I've said nothing...But it seems something in here has spoken. I've never heard them myself but each of these gifts pick their new owner," he said.

*He is not worthy to hear our voices. He is weak, but you...you are strong.*

"How do they do this?" I asked the old man, still searching for which of these magnificent weapons had spoken to me.

"I know not, it is one of the mysteries of this place," the old man replied.

*Worry not about the feeble one. Come, take me, and let us start the beginning of the end.*

This time I could tell it was coming from the left, behind the old man. I pushed passed him, no longer paying him any heed. I walked longer than I could tell. The Hall was endless and so it was difficult to tell how long I had been running before I found it. Damn, didn't even realise I had begun to run, I was even winded. I looked to me left and right and saw two different weapons. On the left, I had only seen a weapon like this once before coming to the Hall. It was called a khopesh and had a golden pommel, with a fine leather grip. The blade itself gleamed in the light, the edge cut the light of the Hall creating a dazzling display on the alcove it rested in.

Yet this was not what spoke to me. On my right, covered in a heavy dust was something I had seen many times before. It was a hand a half sword, I had used one many times before and was familiar with the blade type. This one however seemed rusted and the leather strappings were cracked and faded. 

*Excuse my appearance. It has been some time since I've feasted, and so I've let myself go*

"This is what spoke to you? Hmph, I would have imagined you would bring Excalibur back to Earth's surface. This though? This has only seen the fall of civilizations, nothing of worth has become of those who wield this," the voice of the old man came from behind me. I turned to face him, and here he was. I did not hear him come up behind me. Must be another mystery of the Hall.

*I was wielded by a fool who had no ideas of grandeur. She only wanted to destroy what her unfaithful king had created, and once she had done so used me to end her life. Those after her I had called to believed me to cursed. I am no such curse, but a promise. A promise to destroy who or whatever you want. It is up to you however to build the rubble into something worthy of my name*

"And what is your name?" I asked.

*Ex Nihilo*
