I had been trying to sleep for hours but I wasn't comfortable.  I was sweaty and damp, and in a lethargic daze I eventually rolled off the couch and lurched towards the kitchen.
But as I did that, I heard a loud thud.  Something had landed on the floor and rolled under the couch.
I groaned and went down, my arm searching around, finally grabbing hold of something... something wet, and rubbery?
I peeked under and went instantly pale.  I wanted to scream but I was frozen.  Two human eyes looked right back at me, gray and dead.  Cautiously, I pulled out the rest of what was a severed head.  The head of my gardener.  A few drops of blood fell on me and I almost dropped the head in disgust, before realizing that I was already covered in blood.  A trail led to my bathroom, where I found multiple bodies and more severed heads, all neatly stacked.
I threw up and almost collapsed from a mix of stress and exhaustion.  I sat and tried to collect my thoughts.  I couldn't remember the last day, but I was sure I had some sort of episode.  I'd struggled with violent episodes for a while, but... it'd never been this bad... maybe this wasn't an episode? Maybe this was something more?
My ears started to ring.  I noticed my scythe on the ground and I remembered my purpose.  I couldn't be weak.  So many souls relied on me for their deliverance.  These were just the first.  I had to push on.
Before long I heard sirens, and a sudden knock at my door.  
"Police! Open up!"
I didn't answer.  I grabbed my scythe and waited patiently, fearlessly.  They couldn't kill death.  I was invincible, more focused than them.  Even as they burst in, guns ready, all I saw were mortals.
