Rain poured down in a abysmal onslaught as the sleek town car pulled through the gates and into the winding, scenic driveway of Wayne Manor. The garage door opened silently on well-oiled hinges and the car entered. Alfred let out a sigh as he parked the car in the usual spot flanked by the Lamborghini and the Aston Martin. He stared glumly across the array of the super cars; the luxury coupes; the classic muscles. It had been ages since Master Wayne had driven a car (excluding the black, armor-plated variety). They'd be covered in a thin layer of dust if not for Alfred's herculean effort to keep the manor presentable. With a small *tsk* to himself, he turned off the engine and was left with nothing but the constant drumming of the rain to break the silence of the expansive room.

He collected the groceries from the boot of the car and made his way through a series of twisting servant's corridors to the kitchen. He bumped the hidden service door open with his hip and struggled to turn on the kitchen light with his hands full. Nudging the door closed with his toe, he set the paper bag on the counter and looked to the dining table. The breakfast he had carefully prepared hours before remained patiently where he had left it, cold and forgotten. With a look of disdain, he unceremoniously deposited it in the waste bin.

"I was just about to eat that Alfred," stated Bruce wryly, striding into the room while tousling his hair with a towel. Alfred glanced disapprovingly to the half-wet footprints trailing behind the man.

"One does not maintain his reputation as a respectable chef by serving cold food, sir. Nor does one maintain the illusion of living a luxurious life by eating his breakfast past noon", he replied in a like tone.

Bruce cracked a smile. He made an intimidating figure, standing a few inches taller than Alfred, his bare torso scarred and ribbed with muscle. Despite his impressive physique, a closer inspection revealed a far more daunting aspect of the man to be his eyes.

Cold and hard eyes.

Anguished eyes.

It was that part of Bruce that kept Alfred going through the motions of his job; making food that wouldn't be eaten and cleaning floors that would never see guests. It was the knowledge that maintaining order and routine was in some way healthy for his charge, despite how little Bruce seemed to care for the comforts of a billionaire's life.

"I'm plenty fine with not having a life Alfred, let alone a *luxurious* one. Keeping that facade up was your idea after all," Bruce said with a shrug.

"Well all the same, if you expect me to keep making your food then you can at least learn to dry your feet properly," Alfred accused, gesturing to the little puddles trailing in behind his master from the foyer. Bruce glanced back the way he had come with a look of chagrin. For a split second, he looked to Alfred every bit like the young boy he used to catch tracking mud in from the garden so long ago. The thought brought a bittersweet pang of nostalgia and innocence with it. The look was replaced with a hint of smugness as Bruce glanced behind Alfred and accused, "Well isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?"

Alfred glanced behind him to see wet footprints leading into the kitchen from the servant's entrance. He had taken the corridors inside the house from the garage. Confused, he looked to his own feet. His shoes shone with a matte layer of shoe polish.

Not a drop of water on them.

"Master Bruce! Get to the cav--!

***PHT PHT PHT***

Muffled gunshots sounded out in the kitchen as the wood slivers exploded from the pantry. With a grunt, Bruce dropped to the ground, clutching his shoulder. He dove behind the kitchen counter as the gun fired again.

***PHT PHT***

The barrel of a suppressed M1911 moved forward past the splintered pantry door, trying to get a better angle on its mark.

With a massive *clang*, Alfred brought a cast iron pan down on the pistol like a mighty zweihander knocking it from the assassin's hands. Then with a twist, he brought it upwards in a swift backhand towards the assailant's head. Ducking quickly, the gunman dodged the blow and pinned the pan against the wall bringing him face to face with the butler.

"Alfred."

"John."

With a two handed strike to his wrists, John broke Alfred's grip on the pan. In retaliation, he struck out with his elbow then spun to position himself behind John, placing him in a rear naked choke.

"How's -- Hel--en?" Alfred asked through gritted teeth.

John struggled against the aging military vet. He might be older, but Alfred clearly remembered his S.A.S. training. John elbowed the man's stomach, then heaved his weight forward and down sending Alfred over his head and onto the kitchen island. 

He stood to catch his breath, "She's actually...not doing too w--".

Bruce tackled him to the ground. He straddled the smaller man grabbing the collar of his suit jacket and bringing it across his neck to constrict the carotid arteries. John quickly began to lose consciousness, but was able to reach the bullet wound in Bruce's shoulder and pressed down hard. With a guttural yell, Bruce was forced to release his hold giving John a chance to scrabble around above him for the cast-iron pan on the floor which he swung up with a resounding ***THUNK*** as it made contact with Bruce's skull. The man went reeling backwards, head spinning.


***PHT PHT***

As John struggled to his feet, two more gunshots rang out, bullets embedding themselves in the counter next to John. He froze.

"Al-alfred...no...no g-guns...", Bruce called out weakly as he stumbled to his feet and made his way to the kitchen door.

"Not to worry Master Bruce. I won't kill him," Alfred replied. "Can't guarantee I won't shoot him though...", he muttered just loud enough for John to hear. Bruce paused at the door and looked to John propped up on the floor, then to his butler aiming the pistol at the assassin.

"...that'll have to do", said Bruce as he stumbled out of the room.

A moment of tense silence passed between the two remaining men.

"...I'm sorry about Helen...I heard about her diagnosis", Alfred solemnly said, breaking the silence.

John looked down. 

"I'm sorry I was sent here Alfred."

"I don't suppose you had a choice?", Alfred asked with a sigh. "I can't say I'm entirely surprised. You don't become the richest man in Gotham without making some enemies."

Alfred looked at the man on the floor in front of him. He had a lot of respect for Mr. Wick, despite his choice of profession.

"Well, what do you suppose we do now?" he asked John.

John glanced up. "How about a drink?" he asked with a wry smile. Alfred met his with a sad smile of his own. He gestured with the pistol for him to stand up. John stood and poured himself a drink from the decanter on the counter top. Holding the decanter in one hand and the scotch glass in the other, he took a sip and sighed.

"I want you to know it's nothing personal Alfred", John stated firmly.

"I know John", the butler replied, readjusting his grip on the pistol.

John nodded.

"Don't miss."

John threw the glass at Alfred, and dived forward. Alfred opened fire.

***PHT*** *click click*

The shot grazed John's waist. The slide of the pistol kicked back and locked. Empty.

The decanter swung into the side of Alfred's face.

-------------------

Bruce leaned against his desk in the Batcave, suturing his shoulder, an ice-pack balanced delicately on his head. He heard the door from the elevator open.

"Did you hand him over to the police Alfred?", Bruce called out.

"No, but he offered me a drink."

Bruce froze. He looked over his shoulder, the ice pack sliding off his head. John Wick stood there looking back, gun leveled on him. Bruce put down his needle and stood up straight to face the man.

"...Alfred? Is he--"

"Alive. I was only sent here for Bruce Wayne", John explained.

Bruce nodded, and stared back at the man before him. John glanced around then back at Bruce, a look of grim determination on his face.

He pulled the hammer on his pistol back.

Then he paused. Something occurred to him. He smiled to himself, then lowered his gun. Then he turned and started to walk away.

"...is that it?" Bruce called out, confused.

John kept walking away, but called back.

"I was sent here to kill Bruce Wayne, not Batman."
