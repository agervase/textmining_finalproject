Joy Langston, the highly intelligent woman I have been assigned. Joy is the leader of a highly dangerous, popular rebel cause. I must watch her to keep her under wraps and make sure she doesn't grow too powerful. Although, ironically I find the fact that she is so powerful makes me feel more deeply than i have fot anyonr. Somehow, during the last few weeks I've slowly begun to fall in love with her. The way she thinks is captivating, she solves issues in ways no one I have watched has. Her hair is short and choppy, very reflective of her serious personality. She wasn't a very bright person, most of the time I watch her through her computer and her phone cameras she rarely smiles. Some nights I watch her cry at night. Every time she does this, she blasts music on her laptop. Every tear that falls from her face pains my heart more than anything has before. 

What is so odd about my infatuation with this gorgeous woman is that... I have sworn I'm straight my entire life. I've only been with men, I have never felt this way for a woman. But with her I feel more toward her than anyone else. As I watch her relax or work I can't help myself imagine touching her gorgeous honey kissed skin. She looks so soft, her lips I could kiss for eternity. 

Wednesday:
6 a.m.:
Joy sleepily gets up to prepare for her big meeting. 
7 a.m.:
Joy sits for a bit sipping her tea before work. 
8 a.m.: 
Joy begins her presentation.
...
10 p.m.:
She comes home with a man. 

All the joy that I held in my heart dissipated and was filled with outrage. I felt blood thirsty. I watched this man gingerly kiss down her body and slowly take her clothes off. I started screaming at my monitor trying to get her to realize she was making a mistake, telling this man to fuck off. But of course, she was unresponsive. Quickly I grabbed my keys and my pistol. Time to pay Joy a visit.
