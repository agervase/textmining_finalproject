The pits beneath the arena were dimly lit by a handful of torches.  What little light that slipped through the cracks of the boards overhead helped illuminate the area.  It was very similar in nature to the Roman Arenas of antiquity, or so those that had prior knowledge of Ancient Rome thought.  The strange thing about the pits was the random order in which people appeared.  People from periods throughout history were known to appear in the pits as though  time did not move in a single line here.  A man in a black uniform was adjusting his gloves as another approached him.  "You're looking nervous my friend, why so?  Once you finish your arena fights you'll be blessed with eternal life in heaven!" 

The uniformed man looked at the happy stranger, "You're rather optimistic."  

"Ha, well of course, I lived pious life and I can happily say that I only ever killed that which I had to."

"As you did, though I am certain my number of kills far exceed yours."  The man replied back, adjusting several medals and ornate features on his uniform.  

"It can't be so bad," the stranger said in turn. 

"I was an exterminator in my past life."

"Oh, well that does change things.  But I am sure you will prevail."

"No, I knew I would find myself in hell the first time I killed them," The Uniformed man said in a near monotone voice as he finished adjusting the silver skulls on his collar and red armband.   

As he stepped out through the glowing doorway before him he found himself transported to a very familiar scene.  Wooden barracks, barbwire fences, gallows, all so real he almost thought for a moment that it was a dream and he hadn't actually died yet. Until he heard a crowd of voices call out from behind him, "Schutzstaffel".
