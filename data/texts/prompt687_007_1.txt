I’m a master murderer, when the teleportation booths, which are supposed to clone and kill the original, fuck up, I step in to finish the job. It has been for years since I was appointed such a task, I keep at it since the pay is magnificent. I don’t have many moral problems with killing them, they are just extras in my honest opinion.

Anyway, today is going to be my first day of using such booths. My nervousness tends to overextend itself, almost rendering me useless. In this case, there was no such thing! All of the wretchedness disappeared, as I entered inside the teleportation booth. A voice confirmed my location, my ID and the booth shook up with extreme intensity. Unfortunately for me, a blue light emanated from it, almost blinding me, kicking me outside of the booth. When I came up, I saw the face of horror.

There were at least five clones of mine, to my dismay. Not waiting for a second, they took it to themselves to chase me and murder me. I started running into the alleys, but the clones were me, they knew my plans and followed me.

In a heated battle against the first clone I encountered, I managed to defeat him. I’ve noticed something that could save my very life, the clones are significantly weaker than I am. As I escaped the bloody murder of myself, two more clones cut my path short.

I didn’t wait, taking out my darksaber. Darkness came out of the handle of the sword, creeping its way upwards, until reaching the satisfied tip of the sword.

Fortunately, it seems that the fuck up didn’t clone them darksabers. In a bloody aftermath, two of me lay lifelessly on the floor. There were two more of them left, which I took care of. That’s when I received a call from my superiors.

“Jesse, what happened in District Two?”

“Just a small malfunctioning, nothing to worry about. I’ve taken care of it.”

I hid four of the bodies, taking one body with myself.

After all, I needed evidence that I have murdered myself, the original.
