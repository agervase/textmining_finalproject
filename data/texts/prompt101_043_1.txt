A violent thunderstorm attacks the Earth, splitting the rough land down to its core. A mighty crimson river flows seemingly without end, gaining speed until it drops off of the ends of the earth. A light sprinkle appears almost out of nowhere but the source becomes evident as colossal dark clouds converge in an apparent effort to console the abused terrain. The ground from which the great river flows is pale and exhausted, showing signs of imminent decay.

The emaciated boy let out a sigh of relief upon realizing that he was back in the familiar hospital that he had become so very used to ever since he started taking emotional donations from strangers. What happened next surprised the worn out teenager.

A variety of emotions ranging from deep remorse to intense frustration seemingly fell over the boy in a slow, painful motion until an agonizing sense of nausea overcame him and causes him to vomit violently.

"The blood transfusion was a success" the doctor proclaimed with a smile. "Also, someone dropped this off" he added while handing over a hand written note. 

The boy let out a tear of joy as he read the note: 

"When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy"
