You follow your trainer across the yard to the warehouse. It looks abandoned from the outside, but it's not - you can smell the people in there, as well as the other smells, the ones you've been trained to seek out. 

Your trainer's in his funny dark suit and you follow him as he and his pack fall upon the warehouse. 


"POLICE! FREEZE! PUT YOUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR!"

You're halfway to the enticing smells in the heavy packages strewn about the floor when you first smell the smoke and gunpowder, when you hear the screaming. You growl deep in your throat; leap towards where you know your handler to be. 

You can recognise the smell of blood, of death, of dying. You lick his hand in mute supplication. "Go", your trainer croaks, "run, now", and ever obedient, you do. 

You run along alleyways and crowded streets until you reach the edges of the city. You're tired and hungry so you forage for a bit and then go back to sleep. You start walking again and your collar gets caught in a fence you're trying to squeeze through. With enough effort and sawing with your back teeth, you manage to get it off and leave it behind. 

It's a few days before you reach the area with houses and people. It's not like the city, though. It's greener. Quieter. There are other dogs around. It's another day before you meet your new master. 

He's young - much too young to be any sort of trainer - but he has an open, kind face, and seems unexpectedly excited to see you. He takes you into the house and feeds you. 

This isn't anything like training. For the first few days you're still confused, on high alert, and you growl at anyone who tries to pet you - except for your master. After a while, though, when nothing bad happens - to you, or to your master - you decide that maybe it's okay to relax. 

Maybe you've finally found a place that's safe.
