I’ve always been a paranoid bastard. How could I not be? With the Chinese, North Koreans, Russians, ANTIFA, Nazis, communists, rabid vegans, and who knows what else? That’s why I invested in a small private island, complete with a water treatment plant, solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric generators, and a bunker to wait out anything the world could throw at me, or so I thought. It couldn’t keep me safe from marriage. I fell in love and had two kids, a daughter and a son. My wife is the most beautiful woman you’d ever see. Crimson hair, emerald eyes, and one of the only people who can kick my ass. My son inherited my wife’s eyes and my hair, my daughter did the opposite.

It started one day. Reports started coming in about some kind of waves that would turn children, and only children into zombies. That’s good for my wife and I because our gasmasks can’t block out energy waves, but our children were still in danger. I swung by my children’s school, picked them up, and told them that there was an emergency. I took my family to the airport and told them to strap into the chopper. It was a relatively short trip to the island, only about an hour. As soon as we got there I thought we were safe. So when I woke up to sounds coming from the entertainment room you could say that I was scared shitless. I crept in and sure enough, it was my daughter, staring at the TV. I quickly charged in, picked her up, and threw her out of the room. I locked the door. 

She’s pawing at the door, right now. “Daddy, let me in! I wanna play Fortnite!” She’s already infected. I can only hope that she gets over it before my wife wakes up.
