“Okay okay okay. Stay calm. It’s okay. We’re all calm,” I said. Fifteen years was a long time to wait for a baby to pop out of the womb. I had spent the whole time eating nachos and drinking beer, but I’m sure it wasn’t a pleasant experience for my wife. But now her water broke and weird lady things have started to happen. Finally. Weird lady things that I don’t understand and I don’t really want to understand. 

Fifteen years. It should be one powerful baby. Maybe a god? Is it going to be like Jesus 2.0? Maybe it’ll be famous and make me rich. I’d never need to work another day in my life.

I sat in the back of an ambulance with my wife. I ate too many beans earlier and was farting the place up, which was apparently not helping her stay calm.

She kept yelling, “I’m going to rip your ***** face off you *********************** ********** *******.”
Not the kindest words thrown in my direction.

What could it be? Maybe he’ll fly? Maybe she’ll be able to talk to fish? We never checked the gender. Mostly because we never thought it would take fifteen years to find out.

Finally, we arrived at the hospital and they rushed her off.

“Pull that baby right out of her,” I shouted.

“That’s not really how birth works,” said a nurse nearby.

“How would you know?”

“I’m a nurse?”

I mocked her until she left me alone. 
After fifteen years, you would assume the birth would be rather quick.
Nope.
Ten hours later a doctor came into the lobby and waved me over.

“The birth was successful. You have a happy baby boy.”

“And?”

“He is definitely powered.”

I threw my arms into the air triumphantly. “So, what are the powers?”

“He came out of the womb glowing.”

“Okay,” I nodded, urging him to continue.

“I think that’s it. We’ll need to do some more tests, but he appears to just be a big flashlight.”

“This is a joke. Right? Right?”

“He’ll light up your world.”

“I hate you.”
