Rollen led in the cold wet mud, concerned about the increasing squelch in his trousers. His wife, Neeta would be cross at him for getting so filthy. The last time he came home this dirty she made him stand in the garden with only a marigold to protect his ever shrinking modesty whilst she washed his clothes in the trough out the back.
Recoiling at the realisation that the season for Marigolds had indeed passed, he became aware of a tall black figure standing to his left. 

"Moist" thought Rollen.

The tall figure tilted his head as he looked down at the man with brown trousers, splayed out in the mud.

"ROLLEN STONEGARDEN?" Enquired death.

"Oh..." said Rollen, coming to the grim realisation of his fate. 

"Is it time? Am I?"

Death nodded solemnly. 

"But my wife....she'll kill me for"

"IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR THAT"

"Oh, yes. Of course"

"IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE HERE"

Death pushed a small note onto Rollen's chest. It was on beautifully crisp white parchment and bore the heading "From the office of Death". 

Rollen unfolded the single sheet of paper and squinted at the perfect calligraphy inside.


"But I don't understand, it says here 'Presenting your top ten moments' but there's only one!"

"I DON'T CURATE THE LISTS, I ONLY BRING THEM TO THEIR CREATOR"
"NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CATCH UP ON A BIT OF LIGHT READING. THESE THINGS TAKE TIME TO PROCESS, TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED."

Rollen looked down at the sheet of parchment in front of him, and wondered if Death was born with a sense of humour or if it developed as a coping mechanism for the job.

Death carefully sat down with the kind of careful precision needed for someone entirely made out of bones, and pulled out from the folds of his robe a tatty leather covered book entitled "The Farmer's Almanac" 

Rollen's lips moved as he read to himself the only bullet point on the list, dated today.

"Saved a boy's life. Sacrificed his own."
