"Hey folks I was actually one of you a few years ago and I *might* have lied on my CV to get this job."

I immediately thought I'd gotten some kind of  sudden schizophrenia. Good news was that I hadn't, because the next thing that happened was

"Uh... that doesn't matter anymore, I'm the ruler now. I never really understood why God didn't like to speak to you guys. This is fun, I can do whatever the hell I want, like THIS!"

And the next thing I remember was waking up after hitting the kitchen roof. The new guy had just altered the direction of gravity. *Definitely not schizophrenic.* I think I hit my head hard enough to be out for at least five minutes, because the next thing I heard was

"OH SHIT OH SHIT I swear I didn't mean to throw all of you guys that weren't under a roof to outer space. Well let me reverse this slowly so there's no more death."

After I was able to use the floor again, I had to take a look outside. Thousands of bodies that were exposed to the vacuum of space were going down slowly. Like my neighboor, who was watering his plants. All dead. Man, what the fuck does this guy think he's doing?

"Ok, I'm gonna grab a coffee right now and will be right back, stay alive folks!"

It was a fact, Bob was fucking dumb.

Of course he forgot to stop calibrating the gravitational constant. I felt my body more and more pressed against the ground and could actually see the Sun becoming closer. Of course, I would never see the Sun hitting Earth, I was almost sure the impact of the moon would be enough to kill the rest of us.

Ok, I am going to die, but I'm definitely gonna kill this "Bob" for the second time in his existence, how can someone be so stup-

"WHAT THE HELL BOB, I LET YOU 10 MINUTES WITH MILKY WAY AND YOU MANAGE TO KILL EVERYONE OF THE ONLY PLANET HERE WITH LIFE FORM? GET YOUR THINGS AND GET OUT, I'M COMING BACK."

Oh for fucks sake, THANK GOD.
