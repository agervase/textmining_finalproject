He hadn't done a lot of wondering, had not had much in the way of regret. In a way, that was his special treat for the end of all things: he felt regret. Another world of understanding finally opened, lost until the final moments of creation, he understood wonder and regret. He understood his ancient foe and what had spurred him to deviate from the Plan, to become the monster he had reviled for so long. 

Still, when he looked on his brother's face, he didn't feel rancor or triumph. He only smiled that small smile, and turned his hands palm up. The other man returned the gesture, and they were joined for the first time since the start of it all...and for the last time before the end. 

"Are you certain?" The man asked him. "You should know best of all, this can't be undone." 

He nodded and let out a long, gusty sigh. That sound would echo into the empty infinity for eons: Not life, not rebirth, only the last exhalation of regret. "It's time, brother. I'm tired...I think we both are." 

The man who had once been Life, the man who had come unbidden to his brother's last embrace, conceded with all of the grace Death had lacked when first they parted ways. "Do you still hate me?" 

Death would have laughed if he could laugh. He would have cried if he could cry. "That I am unable to weep, brother, does not mean I lack reason to. I saw this moment when you made Them. It does not mean it brings me joy." 

Life's smile was like the sun, a shining beacon he had missed. "Then we will go together."

Death embraced him, and closed his eyes. "There was never any other way." The light went out, and the darkness too. There was no place for one without the other.
