The hero had his gun pointed to my skull, but I was too pissed to care.

"Any last words?"

I turned and looked him in the eyes.

"Yeah. What the fuck, dude?"

He was noticeably caught off guard by that.

"...what?"

"Ever since I was six. *SIX.* I've been trying to make my way up to this asshole," I said as I pointed to the king's corpse, hunched over the desk, "...only for someone to come in at the last moment and take my glory away from me? I fucking had the shot! I had it planned out! I knew how I was getting out!"

He looked at me, gun not pointed to me anymore.

"You were gonna kill him?"

I walked over to the king's desk and pushed his corpse off of it, the bullet wound through the head still fresh.

"Yeah, I was. I spent years of my life killing innocents, killing people this guy didn't like, and jacking him off just so I could get close and blow his fucking head apart!"

"Why didn't you just kill him when you were doing that?"

"Because he doesn't go to the sight of every battlefield, you fucking moron! He's not fucking Darth Vader or Kylo Ren!"

I looked to the king, now on the floor. Filled with rage, I began to bring my boot down against his skull repeatedly, saying "FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!" as I did.

Eventually, once his head was little more than brain matter, blood, and bone mixed with hair, I looked over to the "hero," now vomiting. 

He looked to me, and began to bring his gun up. Slowly.

"Fuck you."

Those were the last words he would hear as I blew his brains out.

I destroyed all footage of the shooting, and I stuffed his body into the garbage chute. I left the king there.

And I walked out of the room, running through the corridors to reach an elevator.

Fast forward a couple years, and now I'm living in a small little apartment in New York City, living with no one. Little fuck didn't deserve to be remembered.

I still have the boot I used to crush his skull.
