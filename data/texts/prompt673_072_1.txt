Justice. The only word to describe what was finally happening. A word she so often used as a whip against him. 

"It is unjust to take what I give!" She had screamed at him more than once. But Death, like all beings in this universe, did not choose his role. He was born to it. Compelled by forces greater than even he. 

Her justice was a lie she told herself. The laziness of Life was staggering. Once every couple of millennia she'd mosey over to some barron planet and push something into it. Her 'spark' she called it, though he had seen her do it and it looked nothing like the tiny balls of light. 

And after her spark took root, what was her job? To sit back and watch and revel in her labors. 

How lazy. How inconsiderate. 

Death never rested or got to enjoy his work. Each moment he was compelled from one life to the next, pulling that spark from it and pushing it away. 

Where did they go? He didn't know, nor did he have time to care. His task was too consuming. 

Life often searched for the pieces of herself he pushed from their universe, but she could never find them. 

And for all her lofty speeches, her labors led her here. 

"You've finally got your prize." She said, her voice dripping with disdain. 

"Yes." He said, reaching out to her. 

She cringed at his touch, but didn't fight. She had given to much of herself away and there was no more left to stop him. 

With a sweet satisfaction, he pushed her away, as he had so many times before. 

"I'll finally know where they go." She said as her very being faded away. 

He said nothing, only watched as the last of Life faded from the universe. 

And for the first time he knew peace. For the first time he knew satisfaction of a job complete. 

And with those, for the first time, he knew loneliness.
