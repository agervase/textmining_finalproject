The world spun at a dizzying speed as he struggled to find something solid to grasp; something to hold him up, to make him feel secure. His fingers closed around air and before he knew it the ground was solid beneath him again and he felt the hard concrete and tasted the moistened, dusted air. 

"Where am I now?" He thought as he shakily took a step towards the sidewalk, out of the seemingly deserted streets. The blinding heat of the sun covered his body, and with every step he felt the warmth creep into his veins and heat up his body and burn his sensitive skin; and just as he felt he needed to seek shelter, he heard a cry behind him. 

"Help! Please, I beg of you..." A young woman, seemingly in her twenties, ran towards him at incredible speed despite her heels. Her hair was in a messy bun, her shirt torn and held up by merely a pin, and she didn't appear to be wearing any visible pants or skirt. Stopping to gasp for air in front of him, she held up a finger as to ask: "Give me a second" 

After a cough or two and attempted smiles, the woman cleared her throat and began speaking, a bit too fast for comfort. 

"Soigothereandthisguycameuptomeand-" He held up his hands and smiled nervously, asking the woman to calm down and speak slower. She looked dazed for a minute or two, her eyes glazing over, and then seemed to snap out of it and continued, slower this time:

"I was going to work like usual today in my mini skirt, pantyhose and dress shirt. A man was going by and suddenly grabbed me, tearing my cloths off, and ran away. If you could please help me get some cloths! He took my money with him and I-" She cut herself off, her voice breaking. He reached over and grasped her hands in his own, nodding with a gentle expression.

"Of course. Do you know a shop nearby?"
