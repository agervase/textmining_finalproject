At about the thirty year point I suddenly turned grey.  The colour fell out of my hair overnight.  I think it was the trauma, it's reach extending from that very first moment when Miss. Dawson pressed the button on my pod and the glass reeled back.

She smiled.  I saw red lipstick bonded to the gaps between her teeth.  Slate grey eyes peering down at me.  My head was still restrained.  I flickered my eyes away but she bobbed her head in the same direction so that she filled my vision.

'Welcome to The Advancement.  It's morning, Julia.  Time to get up.'

Thirty years later, it's morning again.  It always feel like it's morning.  The day is beginning.  I'm exiting the pod to an empty world.   

I logged on to the federal system to retrieve my mail.  It loaded instantly.  There was no other traffic to clog the fibre optics.

'Good morning, Julia.'

She hadn't changed.  Her face filled the computer screen.

'Rough night?'

I reached up and touched my hair, pushing it flat to my head.  I should have worn a hat or pulled it into a pony tail so it was less noticeable.

'Something like that.'

'Oh dear.  It hits them all at some point.'  I wasn't entirely sure she was addressing me, or if we were suddenly co-conspirators in something I still didn't understand.

'Seth is fine.  He's passed all respiratory checks.  He's currently dreaming of a cartoon dog.'

My heart pumelled.  He's dreaming about Scruffy.  He's still in there.  I thought of my baby;  still my baby, held in stasis without me.  When he woke, I'd be long dead.  Dust in the ground.  Who would look after him?  Who would-

'Julia?'  Miss. Dawson was snapping through the screen.  Her mouth had drawn together in an ugly pucker.  Of course she was mad at me.  She always had reason to be mad at me.

'I'm with you.'

'Good.  There's a car on its way to you.  Be ready in half an hour.  Do something with your hair, for God's sake,' she said, before the screen went black.
