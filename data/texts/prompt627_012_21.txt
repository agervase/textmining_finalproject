April 5: I've finished digging the moat and the crocodiles have already moved in, fantastic.

4/6: me and Chico both had a good hard laugh when this suited up loser got devoured.  all those dollars for armor but zero sense.   I saddled up Chico and we flew to Halfordshire for some juicy lambs, dined and dashed because the rancher's son had to be a hero, a roasted hero.

4/12: we really did it this time.  we took a wrong turn on our trip to Salisburg and flew over the city with THE MOST bravado in the world.   I didn't notice it until after we landed for water but entire mobs of knights riding freaking armored elephants with flaming level 80 magma spears swarmed the north and south.  No doubt a coordinated offensive involving the northern settlement which apparently excelled in training attack hyenas .  "Aid in my liberating of this divine maiden from her foul warden, oh formidable kinsmen." said this overly rich snob bag in gold armor.  No doubt the task master or mayor.  Unfortunately for them metal armor is perfect for cooking the dragon food inside and Chico ate well....too well, I'm afraid Chico must go on a diet, he can't even take flight.  Been trying to make him go vegan for a while, just can't find a place with adequate barrel sizes of soy milk.  Getting frustrated.

5/18  Chico lost 875 lbs since 4/20, not reaching his goal yet.

5/22  Chico relapsed, not good.  I woke up with him gone from his stable and evidence of a massive battle took place at the castle gates, swords, spears, bows and arrows, blood everywhere.  But no bodies, except that of a fat dragon passed out in the middle of the scene.  I scolded him, I made him sleep outside, he knows what he did.
