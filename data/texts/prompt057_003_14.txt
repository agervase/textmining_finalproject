I see Johnny thinks he’s pretty good now he can brandish this new fiddle
But let’s see how he stands against God who’s work is never little

I was the greatest angel and yes my praises were so grand
But when I went to challenge him my playing seemed so bland

He’s the God of creation and he’s never felt defeat
let’s see how he fairs with a boy with a fiddle at his feet

Now Johnny boy has a sense of pride and is the best of best
Let’s see if he can be the sabbath and put this God to rest

Now coming with a thundering roar God case came opened up
And sitting right next to his fiddle was a golden cup

Drinking from this cup will give eternal life
But lose to me Johnny and instead I’ll give you strife

You have a sense of confidence that none have ever brandished
But beating who one who made it all seems a bit outlandish

God strung his bow up in the air and came a gleam of light
The devil and demons cowered back in a sense of fright

Johnny expected God to come across with a sense of grace
Instead he heard some special sound he never thought he’d face

Johnny kept humming  the music he was hearing 
He couldn’t see the face of God but knew that he was leering 

God finished playing and he went layed down his bow
“It’s your turn Johnny boy, let’s see what you’ve got to show”

Now Johnny was a clever boy and had his share of practice
He was put right here in wonderland but he wasn’t lost like Alice

Johnny simply smirked and told the God of men that it was now his turn
He picked his golden fiddle up and took his stance up stern

He started with a solid song but God was not impressed
Johnny looked up back again and said “now here’s the rest!”

God eyes opened wide because he didn’t expect what he was hearing
Johnny was playing exactly what he was fearing 

Johnny played David’s song that contained a secret chord
Every enemy that has heard it yet had been struck down by his sword

This secret chord was one that God didn’t know
For only the chosen king ever had it to show

Here stood Johnny playing better then ever
God had no idea that he could be so clever 

God know that to concede defeat that he would be embarrassed
He would give up the title that he truly cherished

“You truly are the greatest that has ever playing on Earth”
The music you produce burns brighter then a hearth

I’m giving you this chalice which will grant eternal life.
May you live forever without a word of strife.

Now Johnny didn’t take a sip so that someday he’d move on
He knew that if he stayed on Earth then up there in the courts of God he never could play on


Thanks for reading ^^
