*Awaken…*

A burning sensation pierced the entirety of my being as I heard the voice. I opened my eyes and was quickly met by a blinding light. The radiant luminosity seemed to carry on for an eternity, and within its brilliant glow I could see nothing else. Even as I held my hand out in front of me, all I could see was the ever-prevailing light.

*Awaken…*

That voice again… where was it coming from? To this day I still couldn’t say. Its presence seemed as omnipresent as the light, and yet as personal as coming from my very soul. I quickly told myself that this was a dream. It had to be, for nothing else could explain such a thing. To test this, I gave myself a swift, hard slap on the face. Pain… I had never felt pain in a dream before. My mind wandered to other possibilities. I wondered if I were going crazy, or if somehow I had ingested some hallucinogenic substance. I began to consider even the less reasonable of answers. Was I dead? Could this be the afterlife? As my mind began to race the voice began to call out again.

*Awaken… awaken… awaken…*

I fell to my knees, face in my hands.

“Where am I?” I screamed. “Tell me!”

Suddenly, silence… the ever-chanting voice dissipated in an instant. I pulled my face away from my hands to see the light pulling back from me. Its glow cascaded off of my body like a mist, and as I looked around, I could finally see where I was.
I was kneeling in the center of a great hall. A cathedral perhaps? But I had never seen one such as this. The polished ebon floor was contrasted by alabaster walls and tall, crystalline pillars of all manner of magnificent colors. As I sat and marveled at the surrounding beauty, I heard the whispers return.

*Welcome home…*

I took a moment to rise to my feet. I gathered my thoughts, and with a quick breath I began walking down the hall. As I continued down the long, beautiful room, I took a minute to take in my surroundings. I noticed pedestals to each side of me, each made of a crystal similar to the pillars that adorned the hall. Upon each pedestal sat a weapon. As I passed each pillar, I took note of what I saw. A hammer, engraved with some sort of runes sitting on a pedestal of gray and gold, as if it were sailing on the back of a lightning storm. The next, an iron staff with an inscription on it, which had been placed on a pedestal made of what looked like jade. The pedestal itself had been carved into the shape of a monkey, with the staff placed in its hands. Shortly after, a sword caught my eye. The sword itself was a thing of beauty, with a shining blade and golden hilt. Unlike the other weapons, the sword sat upon a pedestal of a sort of mossy stone.

I passed by many other wondrous weapons as I continued down the hall. I wished to stop and have a closer look at these mysterious objects, but something compelled me to keep pushing forward. I walked for what seemed like hours, until I finally heard the voice calling from within the depths of my being.

*Here we are…*

As I looked ahead, I saw a statue of a woman with her arms stretched forward and holding a large jar. The unkempt, dust-covered appearance of the statue was a glaring contrast from the rest of the immaculate hall. I couldn’t help but to wonder why this one statue had been left so neglected.

*It has been an eternity since you have been home. We have missed you…*

I began to grow frustrated with my lack of answers. I almost shouted back at the voice, but instead took a moment to calm myself.

“Where am I”, I asked with uncertainty.

*You are at the place of beginnings, the fulcrum upon which the ebb and flow of creation rests.*

“What am I doing here? What is the purpose of all of this?”

*Your soul is as ancient as time, and yet has been dormant for many years. The time has come for that soul to awaken, and for you to take your rightful place within the shifting planes of life and death.*

I didn’t have a clue what any of it meant, but as the voice spoke I felt a sudden growing feeling within me, as if there were some unfinished duty I had to tend to. No, not duty… destiny. I took a couple of steps towards the statue.

“Why me? Why now?”

*There is a great darkness coming. The inevitable end of all creation is upon us. The approaching battle against the forces of destruction is at hand, and in the final hour you will be our savior.*

My hands began to shake as I spoke.

“But… you talk of battles and death and the end of the world… but I’m just a gardener. You need a warrior for something like this.”

*Yes, and warriors we shall have. Many will come to these halls to prepare for the coming darkness, and many shall fall. All shall fall…*

“You make it sound as if the end is set in stone. If all is lost, then what good am I? Why fight at all?”

*In order for creation to persevere, all of the worlds must be remade. Things begin, end, and give birth to a new beginning. This cycle hinges on you. Take up what is yours. Accept your destiny and take your place in the universe. The time has come…*

As the voice spoke, I continued to gaze at the worn statue. My eyes journeyed down towards the jar, which I then realized was not actually a part of the statue itself. I reached out for it, but quickly pulled my hand away.

“What is it?”

*It is the reason why you are needed. It is that which has brought evil upon all of the worlds. Death, greed, sickness… all of this and more was once contained therein.*

“How can something that once contained such evil possibly help in such a dark time?”

*Because it still contains the one thing that can save us.*

“Which is?”

*Hope…*

I took a couple of really deep breaths, and with great uncertainty, I grabbed the jar. I was suddenly flooded with images of all kinds. Centuries upon centuries of visions shot through my brain like a bolt of lightning. I saw kings crowned, empires fall, and other worlds springing to life.

As the visions finally faded, I felt all fear and doubt leave my body. I took the lid of the jar in one hand and pulled it away. I gently placed the lid at my feet, and reached into the jar. At first I felt nothing, but eventually touched something small. I took it in my hand and pulled it out of the jar. I looked down, and within the palm of my hand was a single seed. Puzzlement began to take hold once again as I held the seed closer to my face.

“What can a single seed do to change things?”

*That is the offspring of all creation. It is taken from the tree that holds all worlds together. The tree is fading away, and will be fully withered in the hours of the final battle. You must take that seed and plant it when the time is right. The ashes of destruction will be the fuel for its growth, and from it all of the worlds will spring forth anew.*

“How will I know when to plant it?”

*You will know when the time comes. Now you must return to your world. Keep hope close to your chest, and always remember your destiny…*

With that, a bright flash of light erupted within the hall. I felt myself knocked onto my back. As I sat up, I found myself in my bed. All of that… a dream after all. What a vivid dream it was though. I had never experienced anything like it before. I took a moment to process everything, and slowly rose from my bed. As I placed my first foot towards the floor, I felt it brush against something. I looked to my side, and next to my floor was the jar. I quickly leaned over towards it and began to open it. I reached inside of it, and pulled out an all too familiar seed. Suddenly, the words of the voice echoed in my head.

*Keep hope close to your chest, and always remember your destiny…*
