Icy wind swept over a compound of log cabins. Small, twisted figures lurked outside each door. They chittered and barked in a harsh broken tongue. 

Inside one of the cabins sat an old man bent over a workbench. He was expansive, well over six feet tall, with a bone-white beard which reached the middle of his broad chest. He toiled away, stitching the leather of a harness.

He savored the quiet time. The parts of the year where the twisted elves only beat and starved him. But every day which flew from the calendar, inching him closer to the hated holiday  was like a nail being driven into his skull. 

Soon he knew, he would be forced into the sleigh, and made to work until his bones quaked, until his body screamed for reprieve. Until he would rather die than take one more interminable step. He also knew from experience that by that time, he would be roughly a third of the way done. 

Tomorrow was it. Tomorrow was the day that the elves would load him onto the sleigh and force him to deliver their twisted gifts to all the boys and girls of the world. It would be over in a day. It would last him a lifetime. Time was different on the sleigh. He envied people blessed enough to burn in the fires of Hell. He longed for the burden of Atlas or Prometheus. His torture was more refined and cruel than ever they could imagine.

He looked at the sleigh, tears streaming down his face. It was the night before Christmas, and all through the house, none heard his sobbing. Not even a mouse.
