David wakes up with his wrist chained to the wall to see Jigsaw standing before him. Before he can speak, David, knowing Jigsaw's infamy, says "Watch this... watch this... hey, come check this out. Are you watching? Okay, watch this... aaaaaaaand, you're now a hacksaw." Jigsaw's robe collapses and a hacksaw falls to the floor. David now says calmly "Okay, watch this. Watch this.

Are you watching? Okay, don't blink. Are you ready to see something? Okay, watch this." Pulling the robe off, "and now you're a see-saw."

But is taken back in a nauseating mixture of confusion and empty adrenaline to find David Blane starved to death and a saw horse laying on the ground. At David's left, written in blood said only "47 saw puns, new record..."
