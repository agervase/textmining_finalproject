With unprecedented fear, I take my first steps onto the planetary system known as Earth. The terrestrial planet is found in the solar system of the Milky way galaxy. The closest major civilisation is that of Alpha Centauri.

Stepping out, my body immediately reacts to the sickening effect of the planet's intolerable atmosphere. As is the case with some primitive lifeforms, Earthlings have no awareness over the unbearable gravity strength their planet exhibits. At just over 9.8 meters per second squared, I can already feel my spine slowly conforming to the inescapable pull of the dwarf's 5.972 × 10\^24 kg mass.

Looking around, I find myself in a desert biome. There is no water in sight, and what's worse, teletransport has yet to be discovered in any form on this backwards civilisation. Therefore, as part of the 5th millennial intergalactic technological interference agreement, I am forbidden from using my own teletransport device to explore this inhospitable wasteland, meaning I will have to walk. The device has been left in the hangar, which has been set to 99% transparency to avoid potential sightings from Earthlings.

I have been walking for 50 hours now. I have extended my exploration radius to 53 kilometres from the spacecraft - but something is worrying me. No signs of life have been recorded, besides a variant of Cactaceae species, known as Opuntia. This life-form has adapted to the Earth's dry climate and has evolved to draw on low concentrations of water from the air and Earth. How I envy this creature now. My search is proving near futile and my hunger levels and water saturation have deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing minor hallucinations. This is not aided by the close proximity of their major star, 'The Sun', a G-type main-sequence which at only 150 million km away, has quickly sapped my strength and earlier enthusiasm about this mission. The only consolatory relief given to me is the shortness of their daytime cycles: following 12 hours of light, the Earth's axis of rotation enables avoidance of direct beams of radiation from the Sun, leaving the planet a temperature of -2 degrees celsius.

Something amazing has happened. I was able to make contact with a small district some 43 kilometers South East of my starting location. Following a road, not unseemlier to the kind seen back on Potromo Alpha II, a rusted sign caught my eye. It read: Rachel, Population 32,000, distance 32 miles. Relief is flooding through me as I write. I didn't want to yield to the thought, but I had been beginning to lose hope in my survival over the last 48 hours.

Currently from a distance, I can see the subtle indicators that this is a large Earthling nest: Neon lights, wooden buildings and more established road links. The prospect of food and water is enough for my salivary enzymes to self-stimulate production. Although, the closer I go there appears to be an object growing larger, or is it just moving towards me? It seemed very far away at first, but I don't know if this is the result of my poor nutritional intake over the past 3 days. Strangely, it appears to be an all black vehicle - something that must not be normal in the heat of this climate. I wonder if humans have discovered the link between spectra and absorption yet. Anyway, I must continue my journey.

Area 51, Nevada, June 8th 1967

OFFICIAL REPORT 12

3 miles off the border of Rachel, pink scaled life-form captured. Unintelligible, however noted to make guttural hisses frequently in what is suspected as attempt of communication. Was very compliant in capture initially, but grew volatile once introduced into the cage. Appeared to be writing something in haste down on what we can assume is a communication device - this was quickly removed. Creature shows visible signs of high intelligence and would be considered as a potential threat to our national security. Has been transported to 51 central for testing.

Thanks for the read, I joined reddit yesterday for the first time and I'm already in love with this community, there's so much creativity and I regret not joining sooner.
