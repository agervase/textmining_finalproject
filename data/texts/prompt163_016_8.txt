In the heart of the central library, many intelligent Humans gather to socialize or purchase written knowledge. Courting season never ends for the Humans, and females always look their best when they enter a social environment, while males rarely put effort into their appearance unless they are aided by their mothers or have experience in the art of courting.

And here, we see, a young male Human, of the Homo sapiens sapiens species, about to attempt a courting ritual, with a slightly older, very attractive female. This is a daring love from the male. 

He makes his approach, shaking slightly, sweat visible above his brow, he needs to be careful to make a good first impression here, so not to scare the female off. 

What's this?!?! The female has noticed him but has NOT, I repeat, NOT encouraged his advance. This could prove an unsuccessful courting season for the young male. 

It should be noted, viewers, that the female has seen more courting seasons than the male, and has virile males at her disposal who'd fight another male for the opportunity to court her again. The female dabs at the markings she applied to her face this morning, with what appears to be pigmented lanolin with added mineral oils. What's is that? Maybe it's Maybelline? 

The young male appears to be encouraged by this behaviour and approaches once more. He smiles and compliments her on the effort she has put into her courting markings, comparing her skill to that of an artist, by pointing out how both use brushes, it is simply the canvas that is different. What's this? The female seems to be reacting positively to this attempt and invites the male to sit with her! The male seems shocked at his luck, our young fellow has been successful! May this courtship last until the next mating season.
