"I still don't believe you," he stated flatly.

"I'm not sure I believe me either, to be honest." She paused, moving the phone away from her ear slightly and staring out the kitchen window.

"Look," she continued, "That wasn't really why I called. I know we haven't spoken in a while."

"We haven't spoken in, what, ten years? Are you sure you're okay?

She hesitated. The whole thing was a dumb idea: Calling her old boyfriend out of the blue. He had a family. She had a family. They had both moved on. She had made an awkward situation worse by bringing up "the death words" conversation again.

He had tried to look past it when they were together. Everything else about the relationship was perfect. He was understanding at first. She always stumbled through the explanation of why she believed she had the power to call her own death. It was a ridiculous conversation, regardless of whether it was true.

It was the most unexotic of traditions, passed down from suburban generation to suburban generation---the origins lost during some transatlantic boat ride from Wales or Scotland or England. No one knew, really. No one could prove it didn't work, either. How could you know whether it was true? Everyone you could ask was dead.

"Are you still there?" He asked. His voice was timid. He hoped she had hung up so that he would have an easy way to end the conversation.

"Aaron. I just..."

"You 'just' what?"

"I just need to know if you still think about us. If you ever wonder about some alternate version of events in which we're not speaking on the phone, in separate states, with separate lives."

"Anna, I don't know how to say this. But, I'm sorry."

"Then it must be true."

"What must be true?"

"The death words. I needed to know. I needed to know that Aaron and Anna will never be together."

Aaron heard the sound of a phone clattering to the floor.
