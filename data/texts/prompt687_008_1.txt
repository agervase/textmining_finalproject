As my pilgrimage comes to an end I step inside the teleporter to return to my temple, as I have done many times before. This has been a long trip and I am eager to return to spread the lessons I have learned with my fellow monks. 

*beep beep beep*

That's strange. I'm sure it's just a glitch. I'll try again.

*beep beep beep*

I try it 3 more times before accepting that this machine was defective. I move to the next teleporter.

*beep beep beep*

Once more I try a couple more times before admitting defeat. At last I accept that teleporting just isn't meant to be my mode of transport and purchase a ticket for shuttle heading towards a nearby province. It's a long ride and I'm tired. There's something strange though. I could have sworn I saw that man get off at the last stop. I guess I really do need some sleep.

I wake up as the shuttle stops and switch to another. It's strange, I could have sworn the woman boarding the return shuttle looked exactly like someone I had seen at the last station. It must have been a longer journey than I thought. 

*screech*

The shuttle pulls into my final stop and I head towards the province. I pass the teleporters on the platform and leave the station. The air seemed still, the dust unmoving. Though I cannot see anyone, a sense of apprehension fills the air. I walk through town, mustering up all my remaining energy, knowing I the walk up to my temple is steep and exhausting. 

The gates are open and the grounds are quiet. The students should be training, the masters teaching, and the gates closed to preserve concentration and tranquility. The faint smell of copper lingers in the wind and the dirt is dark with blood. I run towards the temple, my heart pounding in my chest as I contemplate a hundred scenarios to explain what has happened. I open the door. I wasn't even close.

Seated on each of the meditation cushions is...me. They--***I*** look at me calmly, serenely, even warmly and say very simply:

"Now, we are truly one"
