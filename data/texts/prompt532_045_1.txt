The 23rd Day of December, 2135

This morning, in a fit of anger, John said I should have died with the last of my “old friends”. He told me the human race had become an “ideal society” and that perfection was achieved without violence but long lasting intellectual curiosity. He believes nothing I’ve told him of how *they* stole my work and that my “old friends” and I were those who made the discovery in the first place.

We’ve been holed up in this South American jungle for what seems like an eternity. My workshop is covered in diagrams and my skin is covered in sores. I can’t stand the heat here. John thinks of this place as home. To me it’s a squalid tumor.

The “cure” wasn’t supposed to work for everyone, only those with pure hearts and clean souls – not the beggars, not the bureaucrats, not the evil scum running the banks. It was perverted by the English and spread like fluoride or television signals from small towns to large cities across the globe. Soon, everyone, the poor, the wicked, the unclean, had eternal life.

At first there were hundreds of us planning and researching, preparing. After many years though, the weakest became impatient and abandoned our cause. John believes we’re a small branch of a larger drug cartel based in Fortaleza. I’ve never lied to him; I’ve just never given him enough truth. I love my son but I’ll kill him if I have to.
 
“What, what is it?”

“Three more of the men left last night. It’s now just...”

“You will address me as ‘sir’ Mr. Beck. You may go.”

“Sir, I think it’s time we... you just sto..”

“You would have me throw away our destiny?! Our people’s destiny will be found where I’ve planned, it will be laid out before us and set in stone!”

“No, I… I didn’t mean... my apologies, Mein Führer.”
