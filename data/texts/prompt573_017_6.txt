Called "A Life Once Lived"

"While outwardly, Death had the appearance of being beyond angered and resentful, on the inside Death was calm, subdued, pleased yet with a twinge of emphatic sadness.  For only Death understood the true hardship and pain was having to relive the life you once lived.  By winning you lose...lose your loved ones to sadness, heartbreak and sickness.  You lose yourself with time as even the most subtle changes have catastrophic consequences.  

Gone is that person you loved because you were just a little too late getting there this time.  Gone, taken by chance, is that beloved pet because you chose a different path in life this time that ultimately resorted in that terrible accident.  Even though you spent the bulk of thirty lifetimes you couldn't save your Mother.  You tried.  Something different each time but to no avail.  She was gone and you rung your hands together for days, stressing as to how this could have happened...what you could have done wrong...and how better to do it the next time.

Each time you awaited Death's appearance you appeared a little more exhausted, a little more frenzied and a little more anxious.  You said "This time I can get it right...this time I can save them...this time I can do it."  But, you cannot.  For this is Death's ultimate ruin of man, to repeat a life once lived.  Where Death once found a sly happiness he now found only sadness and regret as he watched your soul wither and die on the vine for he understood that no man should be forced to relive a life once past for that is truly a horrible terror.

The last flip you made Death calmly caught the coin in mid-air and rested a hand on your shoulder and whispered "It's time to rest now.  Let me win.  Let time go."   A soft sigh of pained relief you let out and then you were gone, finally at peace for you now understand that a single life lived is the only life worth living."
