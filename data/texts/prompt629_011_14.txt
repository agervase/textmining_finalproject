Rising from my grave, I enter a half-lit world inhabited only by dark undead and beings burning for power, espousing godhood. 

"Bring us the souls of these undead and you shall keep the right to your own" said they, but I, knowing the caprice and deviousness of those in search of power, knew there was no hope for my soul. Yet I did arm myself and venture into the darkness, reaping souls of demons and slaves. 

Along the way I discovered by chance that souls are not currency only to gods; man too may take nourishment from the cursed and fading souls of the afterlife. And so I gained strength and vigor, increasing my capability and armament with every poor soul in my path, devouring those that would stand against me. The greed, the power, the bloating of my might... These vices grew in my empty heart and I slowly became as corrupted as those who had attempted to deceive me.

My quest did alter in quality upon the realization that I was not warring for mine own soul but for the enrichment of those who would despitefully use me. Now, my only focus was set upon the dethroning of these power mongers and slave drivers, crushing their source of power and returning to every soul the right to perpetuity. And so it was. I did bring shame upon the gods, defeating them one after another, with strength and vengeance never before seen in all the realms of the undead. Some held to their altars with belligerence, while others welcomed my sword as a kind of solace; I smote them all, their cries of pain or gratitude sounded all the same to me.

Reaching their source of power, I dispatched the guardian concocted by my enemies to restrain my usurpation and made my way to the altar. I readied my sword, preparing to exact my wrath upon this temple of avarice, but by this time, my heart and mind had already been corrupted. My true intention was not to extinguish the hallowed First Flame, but to take it for myself and become Lord of all. 

And so I did, and became the most Dank of Souls.
