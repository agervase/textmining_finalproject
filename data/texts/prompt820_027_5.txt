The Valkyrie led me in silence from the moment she'd abducted me from my otherwise seemingly normal existence.  I call her the Valkyrie because I don't know what else you call a seven foot tall Nordic woman with wings, a golden breastplate, and and a sword of heavenly fire. Before my abduction I stood, not unlike on many nights of late, upon the deck behind my current residence in Philadelphia. Ben, John, Roger, and Bob had all just left. Each to their own devices for the evening I suppose, though how none of them had seen this woman, this Valkyrie bright and glorious, I will never know. She began as a single bright star as I stared into the night sky. Deep in thought, I hardly noticed it growing more and more brightly as I focused on it unintentionally. Then before my very eyes this true and real life Valkyrie alighted upon the ground before me.  Confounded I searched for words, but all I managed was to loosen my jaw and stare like a buffoon. I collected my jaw as she suddenly flapped her wings and was behind me, hooking her arms under mine and lifting us both skyward. A few more flaps and away we went. Skyward is an understatement, we careened upward at a rate far faster than the flapping of her wings would indicate and as I realized as much, she stopped flapping. Somewhat disconcerting was the notion that she could see and understand my thoughts, using that knowledge to adjust her conduct if her illusions failed her. She continued her silence as she set me down, seemingly upon a cloud, though there was a hard surface upon which I tread. By the sensation of my boot heel as I tread I determined it to be a stone floor, rather than wood or cloud. Though to be honest I know not what a cloud would feel like under ones heel. There seemed to be a hillock near us, and my generous host was walking towards it. Seeing no recourse but to follow, I did. As I came towards the cloud bank it seemed to dissolve away like sugar into tea. There before me stood a glowing door, upon which was written runes of arcane origins. Though I had never studied this language I knew the meaning of the marks it bore. 

*Herein lie the weapons of your causes, Ye greatest of mortals who shall be remembered forever in songs!*

Undaunted, and certainly intrigued I proceeded cautiously at first. The Valkyrie stood aside, her task to bring me here complete. I placed my hand upon the door, it was warm and I was suddenly very aware of the beating of my heart, which was quite rapid. I found my courage and pressed forward, the door yielded to me far easier than a stone door should have, and I found myself in a hall of some great size. A soft white light seemed to radiate from all directions, though the roof of stone still managed to seem dark and ominous above me. I began to look about the room, there were pedestals spaced evenly about the room in a grid, each with a weapon upon it. I walked, as in a daze. I recognize the names of some of these weapons: Mjolnir, Hammer of Thor, and Excalibur, Arthur's Blade. Others I have never heard of, and take on strange forms unfamiliar to my knowledge of weapons used by men.  Hradnar, Disintegration Ray of Urdnur for example is a bulbous object, but the thought of touching it repulses me. The blade of Excalibur did not repulse me so, yet I knew somehow that it wasn't for me to wield that blade, though truth be told in my fight it would not be lost irony to use it I wasn't meant to disturb its well earned rest. I searched through the annals of history's greatest weapons, as well as other oddities I finally heard a voice in this strange journey to the sky.  'Tom...' it whispered from its pedestal '...Tom, pick me up!' it cried in a desperate whisper. I lurched around the corner with frightful speed, surprised myself at the speed I moved to heed this tiny command, and there before me I would see the weapon I'd use to be remembered forever.

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
