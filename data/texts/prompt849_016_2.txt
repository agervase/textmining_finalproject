In her first last day, remember how it was back then?

This woman found herself, depressed and full of regrets.

Her life was gonna end, her story would be forgotten.

All the hard decisions she would make, how she managed to lost them.

Lost her love, lost her faith, lost her job and felt the pain.

But imagine the surprise written into her eyes.

When in the after-life she found a coin, and instructions on a letter.

To manage a machine to try again and become so much better.

So she came back to life and fought so bad to become, 

Everything that she would dream of since the day she was born.

She became a famous actress, she became the world's first martian.

She was asked to bring peace on the Middle East, 

And wrote the biggest piece of the treaty of peace.

She would become the president of the first World's Coalition, 

And more than fifty millions schools would be named after her vision.

But the thing nobody knew was the cost of her youth.

She had to get enough money to pay, she had to get loot.

So she started to drain the riches from mother earth.

The end knows nothing about the means she used to say.

She had to build a market, ever growing as her health demanded.

Soon everyone had to bring her everything they've got.

And slowly but constantly her soul began to rot.

Now you can see her as she truly is, a monster devouring itself.

Never ending, never satisfied, an emissary from the will of death.

Beware, my friends, beware of Life. Life will cost you who you are.

Coming back will serve no propose, but the ruining of the Cosmos.

So live your lives as you can do, never worry for what you could.

And if you find a way to conquer time, to stay alive, to be holy.

Ask yourself if it is worth it, or only just a pity dream of glory.
