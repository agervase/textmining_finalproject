"You can see it too?" I asked.

She nodded her head and gave an exact description. I was flabbergasted. Not only had I just gone on a blind date with one of the loveliest women I had ever met, but she also shared the same exact disorder in a way I had only dreamed was possible.

We had 4 more dates before I figured it out. She always seemed so care free about the fact that we were possibly the only two people in the universe who could see Pang-wee the Penguin. And that we both shared this rare condition.

She was nice but I didn't know if she was really that into me. It was a few months after our first dinner date when I walked by Panghurst Printing and saw her working there at the business my mom ran.

Funny thing is, I didn't end our dates right then. Even though I knew she was just doing Mom a favor, I thought I'd have fun with it.

Over the course of the next few dates, Peng-wee was lit on fire at a Japanese steakhouse. At a mexican restaurant he joined in with a Mariachi band. Much to my date's surprise and uproarious laughter I joined in doing my best hand trumpet. He also jumped in with the alligators at the zoo, and she had to hold me back from jumping in to save him! Of course the zookeepers didn't believe me. Neither did the real Peng-wee, who just shook his head at me.

I pushed her to the limits and she never cracked. So I pushed harder, and embarrassed myself in a hundred different ways. It was a great time. And she played right along. It's how I knew she was the one. And it's why I realized my mom set me up with this woman. It wasn't out of pity, she just somehow knew that we were right for each other.

We have 3 kids now and a great marriage. All 5 of us can see Peng-wee the Penguin. Allegedly :)
