It was hard to imagine how she had passed relatively unnoticed through the centuries with that burning red hair. As near as anyone could tell she was Irish, but Old Irish...the oldest. When she spoke there was a hint of a lilt to her voice but it was hard to attribute it to any current civilization, and her emerald green eyes were as eerie as they were beautiful. 

I'd seen her scurry through some of the damndest holes and passages, her body seeming to unhinge in places allowing for that strange and unsettling supernatural movement. The cave was large enough for her to stand in, however, so she simply looked like an ivory statue with a burning brand of red hair. She had stopped, which usually meant trouble, and the six of us stopped behind her and held our breath.

She frowned, a confused look on her face, "I can go no further." She said tersely, and Beckett looked a little frustrated. "What do you mean? What is there garlic in there or something?" Dorsen slapped him in the arm and hissed something about minding his manners, but the ancient creature was too far removed from humanity to rise to such a simple jab. "I mean..." she said slowly, choosing her words carefully since she spoke so rarely. "I cannot pass this threshold. Not without an invitation." 

Beckett didn't even seem to think about the implications of the information, he just laughed and walked ahead of her, something we had been told to never do. "Fine. I invite you, come in your high--" His mocking words cut off in a sharp scream as he was sucked into the black by something we never even saw. A rumbling voice let out a terrible, dry laughter, "Yes...come in." 

She looked to each of us once and said tightly, "I will go no further." 

I had never seen a vampire run. I didn't see one run this time, she was simply gone. Wisdom followed beauty.
