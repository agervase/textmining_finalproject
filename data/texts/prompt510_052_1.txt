I stepped out for lunch. It was a bitter cold morning but in the square it was always warmer. People buzzing around.. food trucks and hot dog stands.. and bakeries ! All gave some extra warmth and really gave off the vibe of something similiar to the beginning of beauty and the beast, apart from the tall buildings surounding us.

 I didnt mind it. They kept the wind out but on this day,  I couldnt help but notice this.. Odd and very entrancing smell and sight.  I caught myself staring.
Her hair..  it gently twisted ,breathing in what seemed to be the only breath of a breeze.
Black as a night sky  full of stars, shimmering under the only ray of sunlight in the square.

She turned around and looked at me. I  flinched , my knees almost buckled and i dropped my cigarette. 
I remember those eyes .. So strikingly familiar it took my breathe away. She stared right into mine and as i walked closer i could feel the wind. It was cold but pure like a mountain Creek right before it ices over.

She smiled and her eyes lit up reminding me once more that they knew me. I couldnt grasp what was happening and why i walked towards this strange  woman i was inexplicably drawn to and  as I made my final step, time seemed to slow down...

The air around me filled with sparks of yellow light and all i could see was her face, still inviting me in.  Then.. Something peculiar happened. She blinked and the most beautiful tear.. Slowly emerged .. Travelling down her cheek... Drawing me in deeper and revealing my reflection.
 I know those eyes..


" You remember now " she said..."Why did you leave me ?  " 
As more tears trickled down her face..so did my own.
I did remember.
I remember that voice. 
I remember that face..  that smell ! 
I remember her.
She never forgot me.
