You are an asshole. You've been told this your entire life. You have seen other people preform great acts of selflessness, but all you see is a waste of time and effort. It almost feels like you have no soul.

After highschool, you got a degree in whatever felt easiest. You didn't really care one way or the other where you ended up, so long as a steady paycheck waited for you at the end. So you went into business. Graduated mid of your class, just enough that you still looked promising to potential employers. And sure enough, you got offered a good starting position at a bland office job.

As soon as you start there, you find how you can move higher in the company. Your coworkers around you seem too interested in keeping friendships within the company to take advantage of these opportunities, but not you. From day one, you start metaphorically slashing throats. You pick out a weak worker, study their flaws, then without warning move in for the strike. Before they know it, HR has asked them to clear out their desks and you now have their position.

After working there for only 3 years, you have made yourself invaluable to the company. They have made you the head of a regional office, giving you your own company car and a nice 6 figure salary to boot. Life is good. Well, life is ok. You just don't care enough to call things good. Life just is for you.

One day, just a day like any other, you walk up to take the train. It's pouring rain. Your foot finds a puddle of water and suddenly looses traction under you. You slip and stumble forward, falling towards the end of the platform. You're about to fall off the platform and in the way of the approaching train, when a skeletal hand grabs your wrist and pulls you back to safety.

You look up, about to give the stranger a polite thanks, when you see the person in front of you. He stands a full 6.5 feet tall, a billowing cloak around him. To his side is a wicked scythe, clutched in a hand made of bone. You feel like this should terrify you, but it doesn't. It just is another fact of another day.

The skeleton reaches up and pulls down his hood. His face is a skull, as you expected, but the eye sockets seem to move they way a face with skin would. Given this, you take a guess that his face right now is showing an expression of.. pity? The skeleton looks at you for a full minute before finally speaking.

"I'm.. I'm sorry. There's been a mistake that we just recently caught.."

"A mistake?" You were not expecting the skeleton to speak with such sadness in his voice. "Do you mean you shouldn't have saved me just then?"

"What?! No," the skeleton says in disbelief. "It's difficult to explain, but I'll do my best. You have no soul."

You've heard people tell you this before. They sling it at you every time you fought for a promotion. They said it as of it were an insult, though it never seemed to affect you.

"When you were born, there was a clerical error. We were switching systems at the time, and your account never got transferred over. So, your soul didn't get attached to you," he said with more sorrow in his voice. This guy really seemed to be upset that this happened. Maybe it was his fault. If you reported him, maybe you could take his job. 

"But its out there," he blurted suddenly. "You're soul was attached to someone else! You still have a chance to collect it and live the life you were supposed to! A life with passion, with drive, with emotions!"

He extends his arm holding the scythe out to you. "Here. Take this. It will direct you to your soul. When you find it, use the scythe to take it back."

You reach forward and take the weapon. As you do this, the weight of the information finally sets in. Your whole life was a mistake. All the times that you felt out of place or different was due to an incompetent employee. You could never stand incompetence. With this weapon by your side, you feel something for the first time in your life; rage. Inside you stirs a storm of pain and anger that is about to erupt. You smile a wicked smile to yourself. You're going to get your soul back. And then, your going to make someone pay for their mistake.
