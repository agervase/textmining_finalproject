At last... 

The last and greatest secret had eluded me.  No sorcerer’s stone or endless elixir could keep me alive.  

The healers did their best, but not even I could cure this disease, so how could they?  I am the oldest and greatest of the wizards, mightiest of sorcerers who wielded the powers of earth and sky.  

I’ve cast so many spells in my life, that I could not even finish writing them all in the hall of memory.  When I am gone, so too, will these spells.  

The spell that held the tower of heaven. And bound the lord of shadow beneath its crystalline foundations.  The summon of the Golden Fleece that kept this entire continent prosperous and at peace.  The enchantment around the vale of evil, that kept the darkness from seeping through.  

And last, but not least, the great debt.  The power of so many sorcerers who had sacrificed themselves in the first war, and the spell that gave their magic to me.  

Those souls cannot wield magic any longer, and so the many wizards of this continent are in fear of what will happen.  But in my death, I have found one last, great secret.  If a spell cannot be resolved after the death of its caster, an equivalent effect may be built into the spell for its dissolution.  Pass a little sooner, and you can, indeed, shift the spell’s ending just a little.  

This is the magic of over a million archmagi, strengthened and carefully tended to by me.  I give this to you, people of the continent, to guard you in the days to come.  So too will I give you the library, so that you may have the knowledge to keep this world safe.  

— the last will of Sotek Mazdamundi

I read this will on the field of battle.  The vale-guard has fallen and the evil spreads.  

I, Sotek Mazdamundi, reborn, will claim the magic of spread across the world by my past life.  The evil within is my greed.  I will take it and make it mine.
