As I entered the hall, the large and intricately carved stone doors shut behind me. I began to walk down the path laid out before me, in awe of the legendary artifacts that surrounded me. To my left a well polished shield hung on the wall, to my right there was a leather quiver filled with silver tipped arrows. I continued down the ancient corridor, passing many weapons. I remember every last one of them; there was a spear as long as I was tall, a hammer that looked too heavy to be held up by the earth itself. There was a pair of identical daggers, their ancient blades emitting a faint black aura, and there was a scythe with a silver blade that bore the inscription "My enemies the gods may reap, I merely carry their scythe".

These items were the tools of the ancient chosen warriors, hidden away in the legendary hall of chosen warriors. Every step I took down the corridor meant giving up the chance to use the weapons I passed, for I must press forward if I hoped to gain my own legendary item. 

Eventually I reached the end of the hall and knew which one would lend me its power. On the back wall of the corridor, there were no weapons hanging; instead there lay a sword in a pedestal directly in front of the wall. I recognized the sword instantly, it was my sword; I had forged it with help from my closest friend, who was a skilled blacksmith. How could it be here!? The instant I thought this, a mysterious voice came from my blade. "A warrior doesn't come here to find a new blade, instead they come here to realize that they already have their legendary weapon." Without hesitation, I picked up my blade and was comforted by the familiar weight in my hand. With my sword in hand, I turned and left the corridor, ready to take on the darkness that I must face.
