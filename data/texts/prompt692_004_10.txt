For as long as I can remember, Dad has managed to keep his luscious pompadour without a streak of greying hair and Mum's face has always maintained a healthy radiance. Mr Snuffs, 150 years old in dog years, still has the vitality of those dogs that randomly hump legs.

"Very funny Nic. If I really were in a coma, I don't ever want to leave!" I threw a few sardines for the penguins, my favorite animal at the feeding area. The day was perfect for a walk in the zoo, in fact, I don't recall a time it never was.

Nicole, amiable as ever, smiled while she handed me another sardine. The gentle sun casted an array of shadows from the canopy above on both of us, almost like henna. I caught a peal of laughter from the two children behind us.

"Why's that so John?"

"Well why not? I'm happy and able right now. And I'm going to the Swiss Alps with my parents next month. Wouldn't wanna waste my 'dream cash' I worked so hard for by waking up would I?" I jested, produced a small chuckle. What an interesting topic!

I continued, "And let's say I do wake up, how'd I land in a coma anyways? Am I paralysed? Are the only ones left who care for me my parents? If they're still around that is."

Nicole's mouth was still arced in a smile. A single tear came from her left eye, meandered down her cheek and dropped from her chin. It hit the floor with a pat, and at that exact moment I felt a moistness on my cheek. Was it starting to rain? Unusual for this time of year. I heard a flapping of wings and the penguins flew off into the mesmerising violet sky. Do penguins fly?
