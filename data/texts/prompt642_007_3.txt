As soon as I laid eyes on the Roomba, it crawled over to me slowly, I stared at it intently. The roomba ran into my leg repeatedly as if it was ASKING me to take the knife.

All of a sudden, a loud roar is heard in the distance. My fence is toppled. A bulking cybernetic man wearing a black leather outfit complete with a Roomba mask that has an X mark on it appears.

He starts off by declaring his intent: "I come from the future, I am the Anti-Roomba. I am here to save humankind from the fate the Roomba. Destroyed or working properly, it is coming with me"

The Roomba starts crying out to me. It states that it used to date the Anti-Roomba fifty years ago before the Anti-Roomba turned itself into a cyborg after seeking out more power. The Roomba has declared me the chosen one to stop the cybernetic bulking Anti-Roomba. The Anti-Roomba, angered, begins his slow walk toward me as he sucks up the garbage in my backyard.

I have a tear in my eye: "I didn't choose this life. All I wanted was to protect my home, my people, my dog, the girl I have a crush on that I secretly stal....... fuck it."

I take the knife from the Roomba. The knife inserts itself unto me as Roomba armor is activated. The Anti-Roomba shoots an army of garbage at me but I resist despite being heavily injured. As I pull myself out of the garbage rubble, I shout: "Jokes on you! I'm the most powerful garbage there is!"

I instantly throw myself unto the Anti-Roomba as he opens a strange portal. We fall into a dark void of garbage sucked over the years by each and every Roomba. As soon as we land in the vortex, I see a white light in the distance. A massive ziploc trashbag approaches me. It declares itself the garbage deity. It praises me for my efforts in combating the Anti-Roomba and states that I will be blessed with a life that I will be happy with. I bow to it.

Moral of the story: Don't be afraid to take risks.
