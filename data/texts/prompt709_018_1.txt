"Honey, who's that outside?" You hear the voice of your husband, as bouncy and chirpy it is, call out to you. Your eyebrows are furrowed as you stated at the police who's trying to tell you that  Mark is dead and smiled as they paled. 

You replied just as cheery. "A guest!" 

"Oooh, I'll make an extra plate for them then!" He yelled back as the sounds of sizzling delicious ham wafted to your nose. 

You sighed in satisfaction and politely gestured the police to come in. "Why don't you come in? Hopefully you can explain more and we can resolve this issue!" 

Ignoring the sudden goosebump you felt when you saw the police widened their eyes and mimed a zipping motion to their mouth and pointed towards your phone. 

You eyed them hesitant and the police ended up drawing their own phone, quickly typing in their phone and handed it to you. 

'We had done a forensic analysis on the body found in the fire... The forensics team are certain it's your husband's body they've managed to recover... Whoever is there, it's not your hubsand. I'll call for backup, please keep him distracted.' 

You blankly stare at the screen and then back up at the police, lips tight and eyebrows drawn down. "Look. This isn't funny. I'm pretty sure I know who my husband is. No one can replace him. I'll hand you his hair you can analyse that can't you?" 

The police looks worried but nods. "... please call us if anything happens. We'll make sure to assign someone to keep an eye on your household 24/7 just in case as the circumstances surrounding the body is quite... controversial."

Laughing irritatedly, you force polite words through gritted teeth. "I understand, just sit down and take your coat off and put it on the couch would you? I'll hand you his hair once dinner's finished."

A pair of hands covered your eyes and you yelped. "Guess who?" 

"Marco...!" You groan and giggle. Gently removing the hands covering your eyes, you looked up into the face of the police who was just a moment ago standing outside. 

"...Wrong." The person chuckles and you feel mortified. "So gullible." 

You gasp as the pain of a knife entering your belly just hit you. "M-Mark!" You tried to scream but you just realise that blood was also dribbling down your chin and your head hits the ground as the last vision you saw was that of your husband looking horrified down at your bleeding body as the person who you let in dashed towards them, blade in hand. 

**you've died!** 

You open your eyes, heart beating maniacally as you hear a doorbell ring throughout the house. 

"Could you get the door for me, honey?" You hear Mark ask you. 

What... A nightmare. Sighing in relief but slightly unnerved you replied with a strained "Of course!" and went towards the door.

Your fingers wrap around the door handle and you freeze. Feeling paranoid, you decided to take a peak at who's on the other side of the door through door hole.

...It's black. The person is covering it. 

You feel afraid. 

The doorbell rings again and you end up rising to meet your flee or fight instinct and chose the latter. 

You opened the door and come face to face with the person from your dream again. 

"H-Hi... What can I help you with?" You managed to stutter out. 

With the same expression as in your dream, word for word... You slammed the door mid-sentence of the person's monologue. 

You refuse. "I'm sorry but could you please leave my house or else I'll be forced to call the police?" 

The voice of the person outside is both entertained, surprised, and frustrated. "But ma'am, I _am_ a police." 

You laugh, your hand shaking as your fingers entered the numbers for the police. "Well, you won't mind if I verify that right...?" 

"...Of course not ma'am." Was the reply you were given and you gulped. You feel bad for treating them like this. Maybe this was all just a coincidence? That nightmare can't be real. 

You pinch yourself. It stings. You're not dreaming. 

The door opens again as you look eye to eye with them. "I'm really sorry for being paranoid but my husband is in the kitchen. I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.." 

You trailed off and noticed the handle from your nightmare peaking through the pocket of their coat... 

You grab it suddenly and pressed it against the person's throat. "You were going to stab me with this weren't you!?" You scream feeling unhinged. 

They look at you confusedly and then their eyes widen, pointedly looking behind you. 

"Oh no... You remember." You hear the voice of your husband derisively speak. "This isn't good..." 

Slowly turning your head around, you see the pan burn bright red and the last thing you saw was Mark frowning at you as the pain of the pan slamming against your face directly made you lose consciousness...

**you've died!**

Your body jolts as though it was startled awake and you gulp as what you see and hear is... Exactly the same. 

Mark turns around and smiles at you. You smile back strained. "...Could you open that door for me? I'll continue what you're doing instead." 

He eyes you confusedly but laughs before obliging your request. 

Pan in hand you follow Mark who opens the door and you can see a glimpse of the shocked reaction of the person outside. 

"Hand me the pan, honey." Your husband says nonchalantly and in a trance, you did. You watch as he violently murdered the person in front of you before closing the door and kissed your cheek. "There, this should make you forget..." Your husband's voice, bubbly as it is now... Frightens you and you try to run but you fail and stumble and lost consciousness again...
