It was cold. The wind blew softly, swirling the haze of smoke and dirt like crazed dancers in the early morning sun. I rested against the side of the wooden house, left in shambles from the most recent bombing run. The silence was both taunting and welcoming, a perfect symbol of what my life has always been, will always be. 

I'd been waiting in this town for what may have been hours, days, maybe weeks. I'd long ago lost my sense of time. It's better that way. Less maddening. But an existence of eternity could not dampen the almost automatic annoyance of waiting on a woman. 

"She should've been here by now" I muttered to myself, for no other reason than to assuage my irritation. 

"Which one of us is the time traveller again, Matty?" I heard from behind me, a voice I'd grown to love, sometimes contemptuously, over uncounted centuries. 

"You sure know how to keep a man waiting Emmy" I said, only half joking. 

"I gotta keep you on your toes. Don't want you getting too used to seeing me. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and all that." She replied, with  the familiar yet foreign mix of accents not yet to exist. 

We hugged. Looked into each other's eyes. Her intense deep brown hues brightened by the sun despite the haze.

"They'll win the war." She said, matter of factly. "So why are you wasting time around here? They don't need you."

"I've nowhere else to go. It's engulfed every piece of land on earth. By the time they're done, there won't be anyone left alive to win. Just me."

"I know" she said softly. She grasped my hand, tightly squeezing. "That's why I'm here. The council has finished deliberation. They're willing to take you, Matthew."

I chuckled softly. "Are they? That's definitely news." I smiled wryly, breaking my gaze. 

"It's not a big deal, Matthew. There's nothing left here. Come with me. Please."

I looked at the dirt, singed by fire. Then looked up into her eyes. "Okay, Em. But on one condition. I want to be able to die."
