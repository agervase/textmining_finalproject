## Day 5341

The stream of new patients at The Front never seems to end. At the end of the day, I asked around and the facility as a whole processed around 14,000 new patients today, myself only getting to see 112 new patients. What saddens me is that today was slow. I have been getting more and more questions about the source of the plague from the patients, as have my colleagues. It seems that the rumors claiming that this disease was manufactured rather than natural have picked up quite a bit of steam.

I understand the desire that the sick have to fixate on this possibility, they have been infected with an illness that leaves no survivors and is brutal to its victims. Their suffering does not end until their lives do, and judging from the constant screams emanating from the sick ward, it is a suffering like no other. Unfortunately, there has been no official statement from any authority on the matter one way or the other, so I cannot give them an answer. Just quiet reassurance that I will do my best for them.

With the addition of 112 patients today, I now am responsible for observing, caring for, attempting to treat, and consoling 235 patients. I have done my best to memorize their names and as much as I can about them. The difficulty of my work should not affect their experiences with me, and this is part of that. My patients have really become my window into the outside world since this all started, a situation I believe most of the other doctors find themselves in. Through casual conversation with our patients, we learn about the goings-on of the world behind the Front. The Superbowl adopted an official mascot: a Superb Owl (this one made me laugh, along with any of the other doctors I told about it). The threat of the disease kickstarted what might turn out to be lasting peace across the globe. Turkey won the 2032 Olympics. Water is a superfood now, apparently. 

## Day 5342 

I took in another 135 patients today. This would have put the total number of people that I am responsible for up to 370, but 54 of the patients already in my care died overnight. Their bodies were burned, the ashes sent back to their loved ones, if they had any. Otherwise, they were all given a small plot of land outside of the facility as a grave. This is standard procedure for when any patient dies; burn the body, check for friends or relatives to send the ashes to, send or bury. Even though it is standard and none of the other staff at The Front seem to have problems with it, the process still seems wrong to me. There is no funeral, no proper send-off to those who have fallen. I still accept it, we are in dire times and if we took the time and money to provide that kind of treatment to every dead patient, we would have gone bankrupt within a year of starting up.

The total number of patients lost between my previous entry and now across The Front is reported to be around 6,700. We took in a total of around 19,000 patients today.

One of the newer doctors asked me about myself during breakfast today. It was the first time in a long time that someone had asked me about myself that I almost did not respond out of shock. After collecting myself for a moment, I told her my story. That my mother had caught the eye of an immortal being and how they fell in love. They had me and two other siblings years later. Myself and my brother were the same. Mortal in the sense that we could die, with some unknown traits inherited from our father. My sister was a different story. She was immortal, yet every other quality of hers was decidedly mortal. My father took her with him early on to spare her an infinite existence on this world, steeped in the misery of watching everything you love die. Later, my brother and I discovered what aspects of immortality we inherited from our father. Mine was health. While I can still be killed, my body has the vitality of the immortals. My immune system in particular is so effective that I have never gotten sick in my entire life, nor do I have an allergy to any known substance. My brother possessed the mind of the immortals. His intellect was beyond compare, and he was able to acquire his 5th PHD at the age of 18. I gained my doctorate in medicine when I was 24, and immediately specialized in the treatment of and research on the most dangerous diseases known to man. Then, the plague broke out, and I was one of the first to volunteer to serve on The Frontlines. She was shocked at some of the more fantastic parts, but seemed to believe me nonetheless. The rest of the day was uneventful.

## Day 5354

The news finally broke today. Every major world power declared simultaneously that the plague that has been ravaging humanity was manufactured. Its origin, purpose, and full potential remained unknown. The only thing that the combined scientific might of the whole planet was able to discern was that the plague was built to kill humans as quickly and efficiently as possible. This came from a combination of what we knew, it had a long incubation period, was extremely infectious and could spread through any vector, and that within a month the symptoms would become so severe that patients would either die on their own or be given physician assisted suicide, and what they were able to find out, that edits to the genome of the plague enabled it to adapt to any environment and target the body's essential systems first to drastically weaken it's ability to fight back.

Panic quickly followed this reveal. I did not have time to see things progress on the news, and was again left to discover these things through my patients. All of them were more scared than usual, and my techniques of calming them down were much less effective. Eventually, one of my patients showed me videos of the riots. They were terrible. The direct, visceral expression of humanity's fear, anger, and hopelessness.

Since my last journal entry, the net number of patients in my care has gone down by 90 to a total of 367 and the net number of patients in The Front has gone down by 1,350 to a total of around 36,000. Most of the patient losses were the result of suicide after hearing the news.

I hope that we will be able to beat this thing soon. Its tearing us apart, and I am not sure how much more we can take.

## Day 5521

My reputation apparently precedes me. During the last 177 days, more and more of my new patients began asking me if "You're really her? The Miracle Doctor?". My bloodborne abilities and talent with medicine granted me the name, as well as my contributions to the cure effort. I tell them that I am, and to please call me by my first name, Grace. They agree and we get on with our appointments.

The primary focus of the Front seems to have shifted. We focus more now on observing and documenting every aspect of the disease trying to piece together a cure as quickly as possible. To that end, surprisingly, they brought my brother onto the team. He had changed greatly since we last met. He filled out his form, cleaned up and was much better with people. I must have changed too, as the first thing he said to me when we met was "Grace, are you ok? You don't look so well." Thankfully he whispered this, as any rumor that my health is failing would certainly cause widespread panic.

"I am fine Angelo, not even my vitality can stave off the effects of being overworked."

"By how much?"

"I spend 4 hours a day sleeping, 18 hours working and 2 hours eating."

"What?" his tone nearly breaking the whispered conversation we were having "For how long?"

"This will be day 5519"

He did not respond. Instead, his face contorted as one's does when a person is deep in thought. "Fine. I'll be assisting you and your team while you try and find a cure for this thing. The people up top seem to think that if the both of us put forth our full efforts to the task at hand, that it would be impossible for us to fail."

"Alright. I will show you to one of the empty quarantine rooms."

"Good."

The next 3 days were spent in a whirlwind of work. My brother was able to bolster the medical expertise of the staff at The Front, and we were able to make amazing advances, even in such a short period of time. This knowledge relieves me greatly, as we now have another thing to worry about. Last night around 1AM, 10 minutes before I go to sleep each night, I coughed. I tested myself the next morning before anyone else was awake for the plague. It came back positive.

## Day 5523

We continue to make incredible progress with the cure effort. The day after I found out that I was infected, we received the collective research of the world's scientists on the plague. We are starting to piece things together, and with my brother around, I am confident that a cure will be ours before the year ends. We just hope that the rest of the world will still be there when we are done. We had received communications from the world governments stating that there is no more Frontline for fighting the disease. We were being repurposed as a research facility which also takes in the worst cases.

My brother, being ever vigilant, was able to catch me as I was leaving a meeting to cough in the restrooms.

"Where are you going?"

"To the restrooms, why?"

"This is the 5th time I've seen you leave the meeting in the last 30 minutes. Why. Are. You. Going. There?"

At this point, I could no longer contain it, I turned away from him and hacked into my arm. When I removed it from my face, there was blood on the sleeve.

"No...." he said "NonononononononoNO! SHIT!"

It was at this time that the meeting ended early, unbeknownst to both of us. We both turned to look at the crowd of people. I began to cry, not because I feared for my life, but because I had let them down.

Nobody spoke about what had happened for the rest of the day.
