Not again. That's all I can think of when I wake up and see a 5 year olds handd. I can't believe it. I thought I could save them I should be known I'd fuck it up. After all my last life was pretty much a waste. I thought I could change things so I went into politics. 

Man what a waste it's so damn corrupt I couldn't do anything I thought I'd try. Here's some advice want to change the future? Stay the fuck out of politics.

I'm getting off topic. I was trying to save that couple. Young kids maybe 25 at most walking home drunk from a bar. It's almost like time slowed down the guys chasing them wanting any money they could get once I knew what has happening I decided I had to help. 

What I didn't realize was there was a third guy. I had the first 2 beat easily after all they only had a knife. I've had centuries training on how to beat the sword especially when it is wielded by amateurs. 

I didn't realize it was over till I heard the boom behind me. Hell it didn't register till I saw my hands. In the morning comes the hardest part of this curse. I have to go downstairs and face people I've never met and try to pretend to be their son. The horror on their faces if they realize is almost too much to bear. 

It's not like I have a choice though. If I do anything to escape this fate it will only cause more pain. I've tried it a few times. Sometimes they went insane sometimes worse things happened. I can't deal with that anymore. 

My only remaining link to sanity is to fake it. I know this might sound cruel after all I did just kill their child. I didn't mean to but I cannot control it. Well here's to a better future.
