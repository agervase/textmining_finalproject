*'3, 2, 1. Just do it!'* Sam took another deep breath as he was pacing slowly in the bus.

*'3...2... 1!'* Was all that was going through his mind as he was approaching the cute redheaded girl he saw on the bus for the past 2 months on his way to work. *'3,2,1!'* It was the only way he could force himself to talk to her. 

*'Here goes nothing,'* he thought, *'3! 2! 1!'*

"Hi. My name's Samuel, but my friends call me Sam."

Without making a sound she started turning around in her seat, staring at different directions, around and behind her, and then looked back into his eyes. Her eyes suddenly widened.

"Anyway," he continued, "I've noticed you were taking the same bus as I have for the past month or so and... I don't know I just wanted to"

"This isn't possible." She cut him midsentence.

"Wh... What do you mean?" Sam was caught off guard.

"You shouldn't be able to see me."

"Oh..." Sam lowered his gaze, "I'm sorry, I won't bother you anymore."

As he was about to turn back and take a seat, she called back to him -"No! Wait! I didn't mean THAT. I meant - you literally shouldn't be able to see me."

"O...kay..." Sam looked confused.

"Unbelievable..." She whispered under her breath while waving her hand from side to side watching him follow it like a gullible puppy.

"What... what are you doing?" he snapped out of the 'hypnosis'.

"Take a look around."

He did, "Awkward, people are staring at us." he whispered to her.

"No. Look around once again. People are staring at YOU."

'What?" He quickly turned to his side, meeting the gaze of an old lady, who as he looked at her - turned her head away toward the window. Sam turned his head to the other direction, where a couple of kids were laughing at him. 'What a weirdo' - he could swear that's what he heard them say.

He turned back again to face her, "Why aren't they looking at you? And what's so weird about me? Do I have something on the back of my shirt?" he tried to take a glance of his back, unsuccessfuly.

"There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's odd here. They don't look at me because they can't see me."

He laughed, doubtfuly. 
She stood up briskly, taking him a step back. "Look." She walked to the old lady that was once again staring at him and started waving and jumping around her in all directions. Aside from turning around when he looked at her, she didn't move a single muscle. No matter how close the redhead was to her face - she didn't move.

"You've got to be shitting me..." Sam said out loud.

"Excuse me?" The old lady looked at him, offended.

"Sorry, I didn't mean you." He tried apologizing but she just took her bags and left. Not that it bothered him.

"Now, do you believe me?"

"I guess..." it was still hard for him to grasp that info, "Wait... I'm not in a dream, am I?"

"Nope. But even if you were - you'd probably wake up in a second on two."

They both waited silently for a couple of seconds but nothing seemed to have happened. He pinched himself.

"Yes, I definitely felt that."

"So..."

"What the actual fuck?!" He raised his voice. If there were still people who didn't notice him talking to himself, now - he had the attention of all passengers.

"Calm down. I know that it's a lot for you to process but it is the same for me, believe it or not!"

"Oh, so you JUST found out that you're invisible?" He was trying to whisper but instead it sounded like loud hissing sounds.

"First of all - I'm not invisible, jerk." She punched him on his arm. "I'm cursed. There's quite the difference."

"Hey! I felt that." He was surprised.

"Of course you did. I'm still a person. Even if no one can see me."

"Except for me."

"Yay me." She said sarcastically.

"Can we continue this conversation somewhere else? I feel very uncomfortable that everyone is looking at me like that."

"Don't you have to go to work or something?"

"Screw work. This is insane. My head is about to explode with all the questions I want to ask you."

"Fine, let's go." She pressed the stop button and stood up. Maybe you can help me lift the curse. There has to be a reason that you're the only one who's able to see me.
