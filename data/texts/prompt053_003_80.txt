Everyone was arrayed outside Paul's cubicle. 

Nearest Paul, wearing all  red, the Extremist Communist Party of Pittsburgh members stood with several duffel bags filled with high explosive and second hand soviet-era sidearms.

Just beyond them huddled the Ultra-Left Socialist Hunter-Killers, the famed violent insurrectionist movement whose brave menbers hijacked the USS Palmyra and scuttled her in international waters, sacrificing their own lives for the proletariat cause. Each had a shaved head and a purple headband, and stood by nervously, assault rifles slung over their shoulders. 

Behind these two main contingents a host of self proclaimed revolutionaries and social radicals had answered Paul's craigslist ad. There were a bunch of the individual uni-bomber types, and several middle aged couples eager to prove to themselves that they could put their political action where their mouths had been for two decades. 

Standing on his desk, kicking his computer screen to the floor to make more room, Paul gazed out on the capacity crowd. At least a hundred people filling the thirty fourth floor of the Harriman Insurance building. 

"Thank you all for coming," Paul began, raising a bullhorn to his lips and blaring his voice across the office. "Death to the capitalists!"

"DEATH TO THE CAPITALISTS!" the room full of revolutionaries replied in screamed unison. A couple of the Hunter Killers even discharged their rifles into the ceiling several times in their excitement. 

As powdered drop-ceiling fell onto Larry in accounting's work station, the frustrated pot bellied man got up, turned to Paul in annoyance and stormed off to the managers office to file yet another complaint. 

Paul paid him no attention and signaled to a man in the back of the office to hit a switch. Suddenly all the lights went off and a projection appeared on the glass wall of Mary's office. Inside, Mary got up and pulled down the interior shade, but not before giving Paul the finger. 

Paul cleared his throat and began. "Brothers and Sisters! Today we take the battle for the proletariats of the world to the very heart of the capitalist  beast!"

Another strong outcry of 'huzzahs' and 'hell yeahs' and 'da comarades' - as well as another round of rifle shots - and Paul continued, pointing at the projection with a laser pen. 

"At O Nine Hundred Hours, the Hunter Killers will intercept the CEO of Harriman Insurance. Mr. Harriman will be tightly guarded, but the Brothers and Sisters of the Hunter Killers are not averse to the use of force, isn't that right?"

Egged on, the Hunter Killers went full auto into the drop ceiling. Upstairs there were several loud screams and then the sounds of heavy objects falling to the floor. Paul shrugged. 

"My point exactly, as the Hunter Killers take Mr. Harriman, the Pittsburgh Party will be taking control of building security here," Paul pointed to the 14th floor on the map of the building. 

As Paul continued laying out his plan to militarily take over the Harriman Insurance company, he saw his manager coming around the corner with Larry from accounting. 

Frustrated, Paul raised a hand to the expectant crowd and said, "just one second." Then he stepped down from his desk and walked over to meet the manager half way down the hall, pushing his way through the militant communists. 

"Hi Paul," the manager said, "looks like Larry has a complaint again. I'm sorry to bother you with it."

Paul pursed his lips and leaned lazily against the wall. "What's up?" He asked matter of factly. 

Larry exploded. "Whats up?! What's up is that this is the second time this week your extremist buddies have shot holes in the ceiling!" He gestured to Tim's empty cubicle, "they hit Tim last week! Jesus, he'll never walk again!"

Paul sucked his upper teeth and hummed lightly, "hmmm," then he shrugged to the manager. "Got to get back to it, man."

Hands outstretched the manager lowered his head in supplication and said in a pacifying tone, "of course, Paul, of course. Gosh I'm really sorry to bother you with this. Larry," he said raising his voice, "you're fired!"

Paul nodded as Larry, flabbergasted began to protest. 

The manager shook his head, "no no, thats the last straw larry, pack your things and get out."

Dumbfounded Larry loosed a chain of curses but, at the subtle insistence of oane of Paul's crazier looking attendees, he started packing. 

Paul nodded pleasantly to the manager and was about to head back to heading his extremist communist take over of the company when the manager stopped him with a hand on the shoulder. Paul turned back around, looking put upon. "Yeah?"

The manager pointed at one of the open duffel bags of the Pittsburgh crew. A World War 2 era German stick grenade was poking out of the open zipper. 

"Paul, uh, is that a hand grenade?"

Paul made a lazy show of turning around to check. "Hmmm hm, looks like."

The manager paused for a moment and then nodded to himself. "Got it, keep up the good work buddy." Then he clapped Paul jovially on the back and walked off. 

Paul made his way back to his ersatz soap box and picked up the blow horn. He couldnt remember where he left off so he decided to give them a quick pick me up to get the energy back in the room.  

"Death to the capitalists!" He screamed and the room went wild again, bullets flying into the ceiling and dusting Larry with particle board as he lumbered angrily towards the elevator with a box of his belongings.
