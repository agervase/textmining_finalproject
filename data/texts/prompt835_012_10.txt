[Hjui village South Eastern Kenya 2018]
A white man approaches a run down bar in a poor but lively town center. The man attempts to speak the local Swahili but after saying a few incoherent sentences the bartender known as Kaski spoke to him in perfect English seemingly annoyed by the strange foreigners attempt. 

“Oh Sorry about that, wasn’t sure you guys would speak English, Hey I’m Nicholas” *Nicholas said with a smile while leaning against the bar* 


Kaski: “It’s alright you sort made sense but the accent and word choices were just weird. it’s like how our ancestors talked centuries ago, so I figured I would just bridge the language barrier myself with English” *the bartender smiles back* 




Nicholas: *slightly embarrassed upon realizing he hasn’t been in East Africa sense the 1800s* “Ha yeah my bad I tried to learn some basic Swahili from a book on my flight here..... must have been an old book” *Nicholas said while maintaining his composure* 




Kaski: *with a faint laugh* “must have been a very old book indeed, what can I get for you?” 





Nicholas: “I’ll take a shot of Rum” 





Kaski: *seemingly Intrigued* “Rum? I think I might have some in the back, it’s rare out here,” *the bartender walked into the back room out of sight* 




Nicholas soon noticed another foreigner lying at the other end of the bar dressed in rags and smelling of rancid ale seemingly past out drunk. 




Kaski: *shouting from the back* “OKAY I GOT CUBAN OR BACARDI, what’s your pick?” 



Nicholas: “Bacardi is fine, thank you” *as the bartender walks towards the bar Nicholas leans in close and speaking with a much softer tone asks ‘who’s that guy over there?’ Signaling back towards the drunken drifter* 



Kaski: *angered by the realization that the drunken foreigner was still there* “oh he’s just some washed up drunken Brit, showed up here a few decades back, sat in that exact seat........... and to this day never left. He orders some Gin every couple hours and goes in and out of somberness” 



Nicholas: *intrigued* “a man is alive after drinking nothing but gin in the corner of a bar for several decades and you’re not at all surprised or concern?” 




Kaski: *looks towards the drunk foreigner in the corner* “you’re in East Africa mister Nicholas, a seemingly immortal drunk is of little concern here” *Kaski lift up his shirt to reveal a small revolver* “he hasn’t caused me any serious problems so I don’t try as hard as I maybe should to make him leave....... or at least bathe”




*Nicholas walks over to the drunk tapping his shoulder before nudging him a little harder after realizing he was sleeping* 


The drunken foreigner moves slightly as he opens his eyes “I’m up, I’m up”


Nicholas: “sir are you okay yo.................ADRIAN ? IS THAT YOU?” 



[Flash back to the London docks 1825]

Nicholas steps off a large boat holding a small satchel, after walking past some other shops he tripped over a loose tile but was quickly helped up by a energetic man with a goatee. “Whoa are you alright? I’m Adrian” *the man said while holding out a hand to help Nicholas back up* 



Nicholas: “oh thank you, I just got back from exploring some of the most remote regions of Africa” *Nicholas pulled out his satchel to revival antiques, relics, and other rarities from that corner of the world.*



Adrian *with a smile and feeling nostalgic about his time in Africa as a Portuguese explorer during the 15th century decided to accompany Nicholas on his journey back to the continent* “East Africa you say? I happen to know of the location of a silver temple in the heart of the Congo, the  riches there are unimaginable, last time I was there I could only cary back a few handfuls, how would you like for me to show you this temple?” *Adrian asked knowing full well that there was no temple*


Nicholas: *Intrigued, “Gladly”



[Present Day Kenyan Bar] 


Adrian: *looks blankly at Nicholas* “I’m afraid you’re mistaken” 


Nicholas: “Come on you have to remember me? London 1825? We traveled to the Congo together? C’mon after...... after what YOU did to me you can’t even pretend to remember me you old bastard?” 



[Lower Congo River Basin 1826]

Both Adrian and Nicholas have been hiking through the thick jungles and mountainous terrain for days.


Adrian: *points to a nearby mound just barely tall enough to hide what’s on the other side* “OVER PAST THAT MOUND IS WHAT WE WERE SEARCHING FOR”


Nicholas: “You better be ri...........” *Nicholas stops and looks down at a small muddly lake* 



Adrian: *relieved* “here we are”



Nicholas: *enraged* “ADRIAN WHERE’S THE TEMPLE OF IMAGINATIONABLE WEALTH YOU PROMISED?”



Adrian: *pushes Nicholas down into the muddy pond and pulls out a flintlock pistol aiming it at his body* 




Nicholas: *confused* “NO ADRIAN DON’T”


(BANG) 


Adrian shoots Nicholas straight in the chest as he falls back into the muddy water. 



Adrian: “now I just need to wait a few seconds and,... NICHOLAS HOW ARE YOU FEELING?”



Nicholas: *Still super confused* “I..... I feel fine actually but how?”




Adrian: *walks over and puts his arm around Nicholas* “Nicholas, I give you the gift of immortality, same thing I got when I first traveled here in the 1490s, what you have now my friend is more valuable then Gold* 


[PRESENT DAY KENYAN BAR] 

Adrian: “listen man I don’t know who you are or what you want, how could we have met in the 1820s? That’s almost 200 years ago”


Nicholas: *thinking to himself* “what happened to make you fall so low?” 



Nicholas: “Kaski can you come here for a second?” 


Kaski: “Yeah sure” *walks over* 



Nicholas then grabbed Kaski’s revolver and fired all six shots into Adrian knocking him to the floor.



“WHAT THE FUCK NICHOLAS” Kaski tells as he grabs his gun back.



Nicholas: “Relax, just wait a few seconds”
