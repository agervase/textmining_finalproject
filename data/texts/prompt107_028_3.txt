I remained cautiously silent and still as the human entered my territory and made his pitch, any other time he would have gotten roasted for his insolence, but it was clear he was about to die anyway and I did not wish to deplete my fire bladder lest it was a trap and other humans were ready to enter once I had done it to try and best me, as I had heard some dragons had been successfully vanquished that way, same reason for which I did not approach the corpse and babe for some hours after he collapsed.

After I was sure there were no other humans near the cave entrance I relaxed and began pondering, "how deluded are these humans that they'd think I'd give more care to one of their kind based on some silly hierarchy they'd created" however, just because I don't care about it doesn't mean that there are no consequences for messing with such "special" humans, as some of my kin have found out the hard way, its quite remarkable really, the lengths that which these creatures will go to rescue or avenge one of their own, the more so if they're special humans. And while I don't really fear them, I'm not interested in being annoyed and harassed because they wish to "rescue" their tiny human "WAAAA WAAAAAA AAAAAAA"  stirred the baby interrupting his thoughts, "what a bother, its as if it was trying to signal them here" the echoes of her cries amplified in the confines of his cave and greatly annoyed him, "enough, I'm taking you back with your kin and putting an end to all this foolishness" he thoughts as he approached her and thought of the best way to transport her "eggs are best carried in the mouth, but this pup might suffocate in there, I'd best grasp her in one of my hind claws instead" and so he carefully maneuvered so that he could grab her and not perforate her or crush her, took a few careful and awkward steps, and took off.
