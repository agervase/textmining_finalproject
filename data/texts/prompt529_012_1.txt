Was I dreaming?

Did my GPS really just say that? 

Every fibre in my body was on high alert. 

I should have thrown the stupid thing out the window right there and then.

But I couldn't. Something in me wanted to discover the truth.

It spoke again:

"In 300 yards stop and discover the truth."

This must be a mistake. 

Some kind of technical glitch or something. 

It is just broken, it will correct itself in a second.

I told myself that nothing weird was going on, like a parent would do to calm a child. 

But I knew this was wrong. I knew this was not going to end well. 

"In 200 yards stop and discover the truth."

At that moment I still had enough time to turn around.

I could jump out of the car and call someone to come pick me up.

There was clearly something wrong but

I didn't do anything. 

I just kept on driving. 

"In 100 yards stop and discover the truth."

I was scared but somehow also content. I knew that it would end soon.

I was nearly there. Nearly at the truth.

As I rounded the corner I suddenly felt the cold presence of Death.

I had felt it once before, when my grandpa died.

He looked so skinny and weak.

I am not weak. I will not succumb to it. 

"You have reached your destination. Now it is time to discover the truth."

I realized jus then that I had been driving without lights the entire time. 

The cold dark night was almost mocking me. 

Making fun about the fact that I was scared to turn on the light.

With a click my headlights turned on. 

With a click it suddenly all made sense.

Directly in front of me was a tree.

Someone had tied a rope around one of the branches. 

A ladder was placed at the bottom.

The truth was finally clear to me.

This is my destiny.

No glory

No justice

No happiness

Just me, this tree and my GPS.
