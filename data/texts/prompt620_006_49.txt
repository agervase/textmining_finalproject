Mary was cute. Not hot, just cute in a quiet way, her long curly red hair always held back in a modest bun. She could blush so easily that I liked to compliment her on her outfits sometimes. She was probably straight, but that was ok, I had more things to worry about than romance. Like passing this class.

But anyway, she turned beet red just as I yelled in my thoughts, and I thought that couldn’t be a coincidence. I thought again, “You’re cute,” and Mary blushed even harder, looking out the window for a second and then looking around the room confusedly. 

“…Emily?” Ms. Hodgeson said, and I snapped back to everyone else’s reality. She was clearly looking at me like she had just asked me a question. 

“Uh…all of the above?” I hazarded, avoiding her gaze. Ms. Hodgeson was the nicest teacher I’d ever had but she didn’t understand ADHD at all. I always felt like I was letting her down, and I was, I just wished she knew how hard I was trying. Usually.

“Let me restate the question,” she said, pushing back her large rectangular glasses. Neil and his crony Jake turned around in unison, watching my face for the shitshow. “What is the capital of Kentucky?”

“Louisville?” 

“Very nice.” Our teacher moved on to further prey, and finally I could focus on this really bizarre telepathic exchange. I didn’t know what to say, though, I would probably mess it up and she was probably creeped out…

The familiar voice came into my head again, not echoey or weird, just like Mary was speaking normally into my ear. 

“Do you think she’s hot?” 

“Who?” 

“Ms. Hodgeson. I always go for girls in glasses.” 

I was silent for a second, processing. 

“Sorry, that was weird. I…” Mary turned her head all the way towards the window, the blush spreading. 

“No, no…I agree,” I replied. “I just wished she blushed more.” 

Mary got up for a bathroom break, I followed her a second after, and we made out.
