"Didn't see that one comin' did you ya arrogant prick!!!"

"Well who's laughing now!?! I am!! I'm the one who's laughing now!"

*weakly* - "Muahahahaha"

In that moment I began contemplating my life long obsession with usurping my friend's success. 

He had always been there for me and yet I had held back the contempt in my heart. Part of me was curious what it was that had finally made me snap. What had caused me to cross that metaphorical line? What had caused me to finally do it. Why?

I began halfheartedly crying and laughing at the same time. A mix of emotions swirling from deep within had taken hold of me.

"Why?!?" I blurted out asking my future self for an answer.

He stared at me for a moment seeming to consider his words carefully opening his mouth from time to time as though nearly giving me that ever so needed answer.

"Because... because I had to. My whole life I was always... less. My whole life he was always... more."

I began to contemplate everything. The envy I had held in my heart was going to drive me to do this? I thought low of myself in that moment.

Then I did something I truly had not considered when I made that curious pact with my late friend. I pulled my knife.

I never considered this to be a result.

"Hey now... what... what... what are you doing?!? Put that... put that away before you get hurt!!"

I paused for a moment considering his words and thinking carefully before giving my response.

"If you kill me you die too."

He looked at the ground - at his feet - and looked back at me with what I can only surmise to be deep regret.

"I know. I know. Do it. DO IT! GET IT OVER WITH ALREADY!!!"

His voice rising with his emotions it was in that moment I saw myself for who I truly was. Who I was going to be, and who I am now.

"I'm not like you ya know. I'M NOT LIKE YOU!!!"
