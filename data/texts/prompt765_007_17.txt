**Item #**: SCP-4092

**Object Class**: Keter

**Special Containment Procedures**: Item SCP-4092 is to be monitored constantly by no less than seventeen (17) xeno-researchers, four (4) of which must be specialized in [REDACTED]. SCP-4092 cannot be contained in its current state. Monitors must wait for the end of the current flare before drafting any new Containment Procedures. Any attempts at communication by SCP-4092 that would escape Thaumiel-1548 must be intercepted and scrambled beyond recognition. Communication attempts include photonic waves, data flows and stellar crafts. If SCP-4092 succeeds in communication with any intelligent life beyond its planet, Fleet-H8 will be dispatched to dispose of the receiving species. If another intelligent lifeform attempts communication with SCP-4092, Fleet-H8 will also be dispatched.


**Description**: SCP-4092 refers to a collective ape lifeforms originating from the third planet orbiting Thaumiel-1548. Though capable of communication, social interaction and even diplomacy, SCP-4092 are to be considered Barbaric and semi-sentient, due to their severely limited optical and auditory perceptions. They trade these off for a sensitive haptic perception which can be set off by almost any stimulus. This sensitivity could explain SCP-4092's gregarious nature and its need to touch objects, plants, animals and even other member of its species.

SCP-4092 are bipedal and have opposable thumbs, similar to most ape-based lifeforms. Their height and weight vary wildly, depending on their genes and the social setting they live in. Their life expectancy reaches 70 orbital revolutions, though some specimen have shown much longer lifespans. SCP-4092 are separated in various tribes ranging from a few dozen thousand specimens to a billion. Members of a tribe usually share a language and a some sort of culture. But these social markers are often learned and mastered by members of another tribe.

SCP-4092-1 refers to the species brains. Through -as of yet- unexplained means, SCP-4092-1 appears to be capable of reality bending. Essentially, SCP-4092-1 "downgrades" everything it encounters to make it comprehensible to its limited perceptions. This includes Dimension-Breaking, Photonic-Displacement and [DATA EXPUNGED]. No SCP-4092 member seems to be aware of this ability, though many specimen exhibit a clear appreciation of perception enhancing molecules. Once an object leaves SCP-4092-1's field of perception, it regains its usual properties after fifty-four thousand (54,000) seconds. However, the object exhibits weakened structural coherence and can suffer from Dimension Breaks at anytime. This is called "Backlash" and usually happens when a specimen of SCP-4092 uses its brainpower to simulate internally an event. This Backlash can have dramatic consequences, as shown in the freight collisions of [REDACTED] in [REDACTED], which had killed more than [REDACTED].

SCP-4092's entire solar system is to be considered in a constant state of Backlash.
