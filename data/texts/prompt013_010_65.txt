One knows when they're in the presence of something ancient. A turn of phrase, the way their gaze meets yours, the way the air around them hangs, as though to communicate an unspoken form of reverence. Or fear. Simple folk like to trade their wives tales, attempts at justifying the things that exist just outside their conceptions. Makes them feel better.

I wonder what they'd say about me.

But my gift, a paltry glimpse into the age of those who cross my path, is nothing compared to the man- er, woman? Hard to tell after so many years. Anyway. Is nothing compared to the figure who comes, every eight months like clockwork, to visit our humble distillery. The first time I met them I thought, sure. Someone's slipped me something. Just because I can see the age of things doesn't make me immune to tampering. And I've been at this for a few decades. 

All this to say, the first time I met the man (at the time) who saved my life, I had difficulty believing he was nearly four-thousand years old. 

"Been around a while, then?"

"Oh, I dread to think."

"What brings you 'round the Juicy Jailer then?"

"It really wasn't my decision. Just passing through, I suppose." 

"Not much inside worth your time, I'd think."

"Well. You'd be surprised what I find when I'm not looking."

Turned out he was right, as later that evening we learned the distillery had been housing an underground warehouse what took people and stuffed 'em into tin suits. Sy-buh whatitsorsomething' he called them. Made this dreadful, monotonous speech about "upgrading" everyone. But quick as a flash, this man had done them in and cleared out just as quickly as he'd come. I asked for his name, but he gave me his vocation instead. Weird bloke. 

But you never can tell with Time Lords, can you?
