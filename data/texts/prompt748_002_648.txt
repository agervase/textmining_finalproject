"So... when did you die mate?" I asked the peculiar looking fella next to me.

-"Do you know who you're talking to?"

"Umm? Am I supposed to mate?"

-"Yeah mate. I'm Ronnie Pickering."

"Who?"

-"Ronnie Pickering."

"Who mate?"

-"Ronnie Pickering!

"Who the fuck is that?"

-"Yeah that's me."

"Okay man... I'm just gonna go watch the Mars mission then yeah?" 

Ronnie was a weird fella but that's not going to stop me enjoy this. Most people here were great minds. Deciding not to move on to see humanity progress. To be honest I just wanted to see if Arsenal is ever going to win the premier league again. 

But I felt it, everyone did. The wave of souls going to this very place. We all knew why. The Mars mission. Led by Elon Musk is tonight. The first men were going to walk on Mars tonight. I didn't come here for that though, I knew that was going to happen back when I was alive. I expected it sooner actually. I came here to meet people. Well, meet ghosts? Or spirits? Souls basically. Matter of fact here's an interesting looking chap.

"Hey mate."

-"You know... if everything went to plan... We already would be far beyond this point."

"If... what went to plan?"

-"Third Reich of course."

"Wait... you were with the Nazi's?"

-"I was the top Nazi... elite Nazi... My name is Adolf Hitler, nice to meet you, and you are?"

"Oh... I'm Bob. Yeah I gotta be off mate see everything unveiling and shit yeah."

-"Das cool."

Alright. Any other people around here that aren't literally Hitler. 

-"ETA 5 Minutes to Mars. 5 Minutes to Mars control copy. Over"

-"Control. Confirmed. Get your landing gear ready. Over"

-"Confirmed.

I'll approach this lad here.

"Hey."

-"This is a historic day isn't it? But there'll be plenty more."

"You plan to move on after this?"

-"No. I don't think I'll ever. Especially now that humans are advancing faster and faster."

"I agree mate, you know like I've read somewhere that humans have advanced more in the last 100 years than all the other time combined.

-"I remember when I discovered the USA. That was considered the biggest discovery. Now men will be landing on another planet."

"Holy shit? Christopher?"

-"That's my name. Look, 1 minute until landing."

"I guess to technological advancement. And discovery."

-"To discovery."
