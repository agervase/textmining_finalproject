The cold steel under my fingers snaps me back to my senses.

“So? Are you getting on, or not?” The driver looks at me, plain annoyance written on her features. Her forehead glistens with sweat; it’s a warm day, and the bus is crowded. The air-conditioning in front sputters a pathetic defense against the late June weather, and I can already hear complaints coming from within about the vehicle remaining at a standstill in the middle of the morning rush.

All these things I note as I swallow down the bile working its way up my throat, trying to come to a decision.

I’d been waiting for this moment for years.

Finally -- *finally* -- I could make peace with myself. With him.

*We tried as best as we could*, they’d told me. But they still hadn’t found the perpetrator. I had been groping in the handbag then, desperate for any clue the fantastical could provide me where reality had not. A name. A phone number. Even a crumpled supermarket receipt. But the handbag had given me nothing, and I’d laughed at myself for having believed in the ridiculous superstitions my family still held to, even just once.

I don’t know what had me reaching for that very same handbag today. Providence? Fate? Or maybe just coincidence; I’d been in a retro mood, and the leather matched my new vintage shoes.

Funny how such a trivial motivation can result in your finally finding your husband’s killer after more than a decade’s worth of mindless waiting.

The driver lets out an exasperated sigh, and the doors almost fold to a close with a similar noise; but my hand shoots out to stop it. I barely feel the snap of pain against my skin before they withdraw from their unintended bite.

“I’m coming,” I say out loud. Half an eternity flashes past in a moment as I pay for passage, the coins that swap hands slick with sweat that has nothing to do with the summer heat. If the driver notices my trembling, she gives no impression of it. I stumble onto the bus, my heels rapidly clacking forward by the momentum as we depart.

It’s too soon. It’s too late. I feel like I’ve waited my entire life for this, and yet my entire being is nothing but pins and needles as I try not to make it too apparent that I’m clutching onto the salvation in my handbag for dear life.

Just as I think this, I feel the acute sensation of paper materializing under my death-grip of the gun, and I cautiously pull out something that bears an ironic resemblance to a bus ticket.

*Second row to the left*, it says on the back. *Red cap.*

I see him.

The teenager jostled next to me has their music turned up obnoxiously loud, a tinny bass gone berserk escaping the confines of their headphones that matches the beating of my heart. Da-**da**-*dum*. Da-**da**-*dum*.

At least, I think to myself, I’m wearing the right shoes for murder today.
