"So, what you're telling me is, that, a wall just... appeared... in front of you when you tried to punch him.". Ms. Cowli was nothing but confused.

"Yeah.", Eric muttered between breaths.

The principal nodded understandably. I mean, how else could you explain the random four-foot wall, standing upright on the hill in front of the school, that was never there before? I could hear the kid next to me, breathing heavy between muffled moans, his wrist bent awkwardly to the side. And looking back on it now, I feel kind of terrible for it, picking fights for the sole reason of picking fights. But, honestly, you give any sixth-grader even a **little bit** of power, and they go crazy with it, no?

"How long is it going to take for them to get here?", he muttered out, almost too quietly to hear. And yeah, he was probably in a **lot** of pain. Whoops.

"You were a real brat when you were younger!" she exclaims. "Oh, but I'm sure it doesn't end there."

"Absolutely it doesn't.

So there I was, starting to get a little irritated that this kid was so loud, so obnoxious, all in my face telling me how weird I am for doing what I did and - *right click* - *mute* - *aaaaahhhhh*. That is **SO** much better. And yeah, it got a little awkward when Cowli was staring at me, waiting for me to reply to what Eric just asked - which, to this day I still do not know - but it was totally worth the look on their faces."

"But didn't you get suspended? Expelled?!", she asked, breaking out into laughter.

"Nope!"

"Right. I guess you can't really explain copy and paste in real life. But didn't anybody see that you just highlighted a section of the wall of the school?" she asked.

"Well... think about it like this. It was a Word document, in a sense. And yeah, Word Online is a thing, but I was too far from the school to pick up a WiFi signal."

She laughed. I'd never seen her laugh that hard. Yeah, I was half Windows, but I wasn't entirely machine. The human part of me thought she was adorable.

"Thanks for letting me open up like this. I've never told anyone. And wow, does it feel great."

"I'm telling them about you!", she jokingly remarked.

"And you say **I'm** the brat!"

This mouse cursor has been a blessing, but let me tell you - there's no mouse cursor that can help you kiss that girl for the first time.
