"I am not telling people to put that in their mouths! I refuse. I'm a professional not some damn breathing advertisement". The 10th Dentist said. He wasn't a fan of the Charcoal-Microplastic-Mint toothpaste.
"Doesn't have to be damn hard. Could really just use a brush with water or some baking soda. We don't need these damn child coke toothpaste either. Why does it have to be so complicated?" He continued.

The 10th dentist is typically the silent one, the one that takes everyone's opinions and then comes to a conclusion. At least that's how it used to be, but as the years passed by the marketing and selling of toothpaste just wore at him. He was being eaten alive by these human cavities, but his livelihood depended on their "patronage" a bit. 
Still, he started during the 80's, before the overcommercialization of tooth paste. Before all the fruity/sweet flavors, before the dirt and trash plastic, before it all got overcomplicated. 

"And you! You all call yourself my peers? Just sitting here and filling your mouths with their lies? Their complicating of something damn simple? Just brush your damn teeth as much as you can to keep them nice and healthy. Also avoid smoking, soft drinks, and drugs. That used to be it". He continues "What happen to keep teeth and people healthy? What happen to being Dentists? I'm ashamed of all of you!". He exclaimed before leaving the room. 

The next night the 10th Dentist put together an armament of teeth cleaning related products, the best, the most trusted. He then set out to right the wrongs of dentistry. He started providing free services to those with failing teeth or those that couldn't afford proper dental assistance. And during the night, there is a legend that a lone rogue dentist destroys the complicated toothpaste and leaves behind simple toothpaste. He also attacks those who peddle sugar in public.
Beware! Beware the 10th Dentist.
