They were everywhere. The squirrels. Chittering, mocking me with their tiny clutching claws and their razor incisors.

I'd chased them all through my apartment, the entire infestation of them, their furry tales cocked high in haughty defiance. They laughed at me, avoiding my trusty rake weapon of choice, but I knew if I could hook one or two of them the rest would get the message and leave me in peace.

I woke up to them on my chest, I found their fur in everything I ate. It clogged my drains. I could hear their chittering as I tried to fall asleep, I could feel them scratching with their cruel little nails as I tried to read or watch TV. For months on end. Sometimes they all just stood on their hind legs and watched me with their dead little eyes, daring me to get up and do something or try to catch them.

No more. At first, I'd been afraid of the squirrels. Now I'm furious. I would destroy them.

I smacked and smacked with the rake, striking a wall, taking out a lamp, shattering a vase, knocking over a coat rack, but they avoided it, laughing their chitters at me, baring their buck teeth at me and hissing.

I managed to get them all rounded up. I opened my front door and chased them all the way out to the parking lot. I was in my robe. I didn't care. Victory was at hand. Soon I'd be able to truly sleep like I hadn't in months.

They were crawling on the cars now. They didn't think I'd have the courage to risk damaging someone else's property.

They had another thing coming.

Question: Like everyone else, I have a subreddit as you can see. Could anyone tell me how to get the little flair where it appears next to my username?
