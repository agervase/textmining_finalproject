“Same day, same story” I thought when I got on the bus. 
I was getting to the university (as every other day) and I was taking the bus (as every other day).

I set next to the door (as every other day) and listened to music (as every other day) waiting for the girl with dark curly hair and black skin to get on the bus too (as every other day).

And there she was, two stops later, the girl. She was wearing a skirt and a sweater (as every other day). She stopped on the opposite side of the bus (as every other day) and checked on everyone in this bus (as every other day). I waited for her to check on the persone set right in front of me and then I turned away, so that she wouldn’t know I was staring (as every other day).

I knew that, when I’d get to my stop, she’s still in the bus. That’s why I know I have time.

I stood up and let an older woman sit at my place (not as every other day) then I went next to the girl, who moved a little.

“Hi” I said (not as every other day).

She didn’t reply.

“Uhm...- maybe... she was just shy? -Do you—“ 
I stopped. What was the pick up line? Heck, I hate my little memory.
“Sorry, you’re so pretty I forgot my line... just... I’m Ayle” I said, showing my hand for her to shake it.

The girl stood silent.

“Uh, Hello? I’m talking to you.”

And that’s when she turned around and stared at me. “Wait...” she said.
I was confused. She looked creeped out.
“What?” I said, still really confused.
“Do you see me?”

The heck?

“Yes, of course? I have eyes and they work, you know?”
“I mean... How?”

This girl’s crazy.

“With my eyes?”
“You shouldn’t be able to see me.”
“Oh gosh, why?”
“Because I... I do not exist.”
“What?”
“I died. I don’t know why I’m still on here, but I died.”

She’s totally out.

“No, look! I can touch you!” I said, holding her hand. She removed her hand as if she got burned and stared back at me in pure horror.

“I died! I remember dying. It felt awful.”
“You’re breathing, you can’t be dead.”
“I died of murder.”
“This can’t be real.” I shook hard my head; this girl IS crazy.

“Look, my stop! Enjoy your... life? Death? Whatever” I said, getting out of the bus.

This was not like every other day. 

“Young man! Wait” called out a woman, who also just got out of the bus.
“Yes, ma’am?”
“Were you talking with Crissie?”
“I...guess?”
“You’re new, aren’t you?” asked the lady, almost laughing.
“What do you mean?”

The lady started looking for something in her big red bag, then exclaimed “ah-ha! Got it!”
“What is it?”
“A picture of her.”
“But— why?”

“Crissie... she’s mad. She is out of her mind ever since she got almost killed. She is convinced she died, back then.”

Well, that explained much.

“The docs said not to tell her otherwise, unless she annoys us.”
“That’s not really fair.”
“I mean... life really isn’t.”

The lady looks nice, so I try “Who tried to kill her?”
“Her mother” she replied coldly.
“Gee, that’s awful. A mother should know her daughter! She shouldn’t attempt to kill her!” I complain loudly.
“I know, right? That’s why I came back to end my job. I really missed my baby girl.”

Maybe, it would have been better for it to be the same as the other days. At least he wouldn’t be running from a psycho murderer.
