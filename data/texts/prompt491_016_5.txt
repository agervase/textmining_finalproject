Every time a human dies, time stands still. It stays still for me until I locate the newly freed soul, and give it passage to it's afterlife. Some to Valhalla, some to Olympus, others to Heaven, for some reason many of these modern humans choose to go to hell, because they think they belong there. No matter what it takes me hours to collect them, usher them and help them get connected with their spirit guide.

Then time starts and another dies and I'm back at it. 

So it's gone for 100,000 years of human life. There have been times where work wasn't busy, and times when a year for humans went on for thousands of years for me because of a plague or war.

Still I love my job. The feeling of joy that emanates from their soul when they reach their afterlife brings me joy that no living human can understand. Also the shapeshifting to their pleasing form is nice too. 

So 100,000 years later doing the best job a Phantasm can do and I almost lost my job. I don't understand human politics, but a large war broke out, and it led to a disease being loosed on humanity that killed 99.9996% of them in weeks. 

Weeks that seemed like millennia to me. There were seven billion of them you see, seven billion souls to usher, and sure I may have been less cheery about it, because I was rushing around like you wouldn't believe, but I'd never want this job to end, because with this job's end, so goes my existence. 

Now there stands just 5,341 of them.... 5,340 of them.

These aren't the best and the brightest. That last one was cleaning a firearm "For protection" and didn't unload it first. He blew his brains out all over a nice marble statue. 

Shame there isn't anyone else around to clean it up. 

This leaves me with a lot of free time though. I've devised a plan to save humanity, and myself I just need to keep them alive in the mean time.
