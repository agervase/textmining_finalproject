Beatrice is telling them I'm asleep. "He will decline to appear on your morning television show, but thank you".

The howling starts low. The solo rotary siren is joined by another, and then another, blasting out sound waves at 2900 revolutions per minute. The wailing is in unison. It rapidly gets louder, and then it stays that way. Air Raid sirens are designed to deliver a message: get the fuck out of the street and take cover. In an underground tube station, your basement, or if you were lucky, a bomb shelter.  "Don't run" the posters said "Others will do the same".

This was fifth one that night and the adults in the room didn't expect the planes to come this time either.

We didn't make it.

They called it the Blitz.

I know this because that night after the Luftwaffe  bombed the living hell out of this city, and two years before the RAF bombed the living hell out Hamburg, I was collateral damage. They didn't call it that back then, but when you listen to BBC News for 12 hours a day for 70 years, you stay educated informed and entertained. That's 40 years over the radio, 30 from a television. Placed by my bed while science tried to reconcile the sporadic electrical activity in my brain and the lifeless flesh on the other end of the IV line.

"Our viewers want to know, after 70 years in a coma, whats changed the most?"

&#x200B;

"Back then we were fighting facism. Fascism causes war. And war kills innocent families and puts eight year olds in comas. What's changed ... is that people are forgetting that."
