    “‘TIS I, LORD GRANDUATH, SLAYER OF MEN, DESTROYER OF REALMS, RULER OF—”
    “Dude, what the Hell? I was just—”
    “YOU SHALL NOT DARE DISRESPECT THE REALM OF MY PEOPLE, WHERE YOU DISGUSTING HUMANS GO TO—”
    “Would you shut up already? I’m clearly busy here.”
    Andrew steadily put another line of icing around the edge of the cake, then sighed and turned around. In front of him was a being which clearly was not human. “Lord Granduath,” as he called himself, was a bright red creature with what seemed to be three mouths, each with a few tongues hanging from them. His seven eyes stared unblinkingly into Andrew’s soul, seeing all of his worthless human life in front of him. He raised one of his many arms and pointed at Andrew.
    “YOU HAVE SUMMONED ME HERE. WHY.”
    “What, do you think I was trying to summon some gross red dude to my kitchen? You’re getting that weird yellow goop everywhere. Stop drooling.” Andrew looked at the floor beneath Lord Granduath, which was covered in the disgusting slime.
    “YOU WILL NOT DISRESPECT MY—”
    “It’s gross, dude. Clean it up.”
    “YOU CAN NOT—” he motioned with his hand again before being interrupted.
    “Can you stop doing that? Your...arm slime is getting all over.”
    “Listen, I’m really insecure about that, okay?
    The two stared at each other for a moment.
    “I mean...MY ARM SLIME IS NOT TO BE RIDICULED BY A FOOLISH HUMAN SUCH AS YOU!”
    “Hey, listen, man. I didn’t really intend to summon you, and I don’t know how I—”
    “YOU SANG THE SACRED SONG WHILE ICING A CAKE. THAT IS MY CALLING.”
    “I was singing ‘Stacey’s Mom.’”
    “PRECISELY.”
    “And icing a cake.”
    “THAT IS CORRECT.”
    “And that summons you?”
    “INDEED.”
    “I’m not sure I follow.”
    “‘STACEY’S MOM’ IS THE SACRED SONG. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE POWER OF CAKE ICING, I SHALL BE SUMMONED.”
    “Granduath—”
    "THAT’S LORD GRANDUATH TO A MORTAL SUCH AS YOU.”
    "Listen, Grandy.” Lord Granduath stared intensely into his soul. “I just don’t get it. Why is ‘Stacey’s Mom’ the sacred song? And why does icing a cake bestow such power?”
    "IF YOU DARE CALL ME ANYTHING OTHER THAN MY BIRTH NAME, LORD GRANDUATH, I SHALL OBLITERATE THIS ENTIRE REALM.”
    "Okay, fine, whatever. Can you answer my questions, Lord Granduath?”
    "I just really like that song, okay?”
    Andrew took a moment. “And the icing?”
    "Well, when I see icing, I just can’t help myself, you know?” His mouths gave a little hint of a smile.
    Andrew looked at him. “Hey, listen, Grandy—”
    "WHAT DID I TELL YOU?”
    "Lord Granduath, I get it. I totally understand. Um, why don’t you just, stay there for a minute.”
    "I WILL NOT ALLOW A MERE MORTAL TO COMMAND ME.”
    "It’ll be fun!”
    "OKAY, FINE. BUT ONLY THIS ONCE. AND IF YOU TRY ANYTHING OR IF YOU DISRESPECT MY NAME EVEN ONE MORE TIME, I WILL NOT HESITATE TO DESTROY THIS REALM WITH MY INFINITE POWER.”
    Andrew nodded, and turned back to his cake. Lord Granduath stared and Andrew’s back as the cake was topped with icing. Andrew finished the icing on his cake, a few words written on the top. “Stay there just a little bit longer,” he told Lord Granduath, and he covered the cake and ran into the other room. He grabbed something off the table and returned to the kitchen. “Close your eyes and sit at the table there,” he told Lord Granduath.
    "THAT’S IT. I WILL DESTROY ALL—”
    "Oh, shut up already. Just sit down.”
    Lord Granduath complied and sat down at the table, a few of his arms covering his many eyes. There weren’t enough arms to cover them all, so he used a few tongues to cover the rest. Andrew grabbed the cake from the counter and set it in front of him, taking off the cover. He turned on the speaker he had grabbed from a room over.
    "Open your eyes, Grandy!”
This time, Lord Granduath did not correct him. He simply looked out at the table in front of him and smiled with a few of his mouths. He could hear “Stacey’s Mom” playing from the speaker, and in front of him, a delicious looking cake drenched in icing with a message: “For Grandy.” Lord Granduath, laughed, ate, danced, and sang for the rest of the night. Then he followed through with his promise and destroyed the realm of humans with his infinite power.
