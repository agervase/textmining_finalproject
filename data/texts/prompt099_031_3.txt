Kay {Chapter 1}

"Get up Kay, its time for school," my mom gently shakes me. I've already been up thinking... Dreading this moment. My mom goes into her room and gets ready for work. She has my clothes already picked out. I gotta remember to pick out my own clothes for tomorrow.

It's my first day of middle school. My mom says this is where I'll finally find myself... Whatever that means. First difference: the bus. No familiar faces and its the Green bus rather than Purple. The green letters are in some kind of markings I dont quite understand. I sit in the middle and listen to music, ignoring the world. 

Once I get to the school, I'm told to follow the green lights to get to my homeroom. I do as I'm told and go straight to the green classroom. The color coded thing is too childish... We should all be able to read by now! I enter the classroom and look for my seat. Second difference: no name tags! I smile at this... We should be able to introduce ourselves now instead of everyone awkwardly asking questions.

I decide to sit in the middle. I dont like too much attention. I look around the classroom. Again, no familiar faces and what's odd is that there's only like six people in this homeroom. Third difference. 

We all stay quiet as the teacher walks on wearing a green dress. What is up with the color green?

"Okay class, first of all... Good morning!" She looks up at the time.

"Good morning," we all mumble in unison.

She laughs. "We'll work on that! My name is Mrs. Jones and I will be your homeroom teacher for this year. I want to call attendance before we all get to know each other." Mrs. Jones clicks at her desktop a few tines to bring up the role call I guess.

While she's calling names, I notice something odd. Too odd. I hear my mother's voice in my head, "You're going to find yourself this year."

Why is my name last? Why am I the only name that starts with the letter K?
