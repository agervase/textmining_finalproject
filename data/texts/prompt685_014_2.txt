"World War 3 has begun," said the old man. He gazed skyward, tracking the missile's contrail as it screamed away from the silo. He knew in about forty\-five minutes the return volley would be at his position. So precious little time remained, yet he still felt no particular hurry in going back inside, sitting down at his desk, and picking up the phone. It was an ancient device, hardly ever used, and heavier than it looked. He propped the earpiece between his head and his shoulder, and calmly waited for the voice on the other end to speak. He rattled off the latest code, and was put through to the General's desk, then rattled off his incident report to the General. After that, he threw the phone with casual ease back into its cradle, and picked up a book.

The other guard in the silo snorted, waking himself from slumber, and asked what he'd missed.

"Nothing, Norm," said the old man. "Go back to sleep."

The thuds weren't as loud as he was expecting, but they were audible. He counted fourteen before they began to come in such clusters that there was no possible way for him to distinguish how many had fallen. What was curious was the silence that followed. By now, the mountain should've screamed, shaking apart in violence and with furious noise. But there was nothing of the sort. Just the irregular thump of those missiles that were late.

They stayed in the silo for three days, until at last ten hours had passed without the sound of impact.

"I guess we should poke our heads out," said Norm. The old man grunted and gestured towards the door.

"Feel free," he said. "I don't really care to be flash\-fried."

Norm sighed, shook his head, and opened the door outside.

"Hey, Lieutenant," he said. "I think you should see this."

The old man stumped over to the door, and peered outside. Shards of broken missiles littered the mountainside, with no evidence of any explosions of any sort.

"I need to make a phone call," said the old Lieutenant.

It wasn't called World War 3. It wasn't called anything. Hardly any humans were around to witness five hundred year old rockets failing to end the last smatterings of the species. The nuclear weapons of 2664 were no more a threat to the planet than the humans of 2664, those few hundreds of thousands that remained, scattered in family\-sized bands across the globe. In time, even those few died out. Humanity made good on its threat to die with a whimper, rather than a bang.
