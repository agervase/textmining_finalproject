The doctor was startled from his power nap at his table by a familiar voice. He knew everything to know about each one of his patients. Everyone acted the natural way on knowing their end. But, this one was a total opposite.

"I'm ready to leave, doc.", said the boy closing the doors behind.

The doctor believed to maintain least exposure of emotions at all times. But, the boy standing in front always made him smile. His lean body, his extended round face like that of cartoon drawings, his tone of voice, his growing restlessness with each passing moment and every feature of him amused the doctor.

The doctor stood staring at himself. He splashed cold tap water to recover from his slumber. In an instant, he was face to face with his intruding patient.

" Yes, my dear, why have you come?", the words came out fluently from the doctor.

"Everything's over. I'm ready to leave, doc".

The doctor chuckled. "Not so fast, dear. I juat ran through a diagnosis and fo-"

"Don't say the lymphoma is over"

"No. What I was trying to say is that, the diagnosis detected less spreading of virus and some of your cells are at its best health"

"No. Not again, doc."

"Don't worry. Prepare another list for 6 more months"

"Don't you understand, doctor. The only item left unchecked in my second set of to-do list is-"

The door banged hard and a nurse came rushing in saying it was an emergency. The doctor started following the nurse with the boy tagging along. The nurse started narrating the details.

A child was in need of an heart transplantation. The doctor and the boy listened in silence. The doctor looked at the boy smiling on hearing the requirements. Only the boy had the specifications of a perfect heart donor.

"Never think of that", the doctor said.

"You never asked me what my unchecked wish was."

"What? To get you heart handed over to someone" the doctor said irked.

"To save a life."
