 Everyone knew humanity was doomed after the war. The third one. Political tension lead to war preparation, war threats and more war preparation. Before anyone could react, the first declarations were made, and a long row of  alliances soon got most of the civilized world involved. But this time, everything was different. Since the dawn, it was clear that both the gene editing techniques, and the nuclear ammunition were setting the scene for a colossal fiasco, some sort of an epic **goodbye** show of humanity, but its true magnitude was unpredictable. Most people in civilized countries had been turned into radiation-resistant mutants, only vulnerable to the enormous blast of nuclear bombs. However, the new mutation had one devastating effect: The modified strain of rabies used by some countries for biological warfare was now turning most people it infected into zombies. However, there was a small select group, that would gain super-human abilities after an infection, with the trade-off that they needed to consume blood to stay alive. Those were the vampires   
 

He was walking down the subway tunnel. Those were the only places where a human could hope to be zombie-free. They had very little reason to come through those places, as they were relatively devoid of big mammals. They made for a very efficient way of transportation, but fear of walking alone, through the dark kept most people away from the tunnels.  Not for this man, though. He was a 1.90m tall, muscular man, walking through the tunnel from Victory square, to The University. His walk was confident, what could a man fear in a tunnel? At least for now, the vampire settlements in the subway tunnels were unknown to humans, not including a few rumors here and there. He kept his relaxed walk, until a sound from the darkness in front of him made him stop abruptly. As it approached, got clearer and clearer that it was an approaching zombie horde. He was, of course surprised. What could have brought those zombies this deep underground?    
 

I was watching the scene unfold from the darkness of my cover, waiting for an opportunity to strike. The man, terrified of the oncoming danger thoughtlessly pulled out his gun, a glock 18 and started firing. He got three of the seven zombies, but missed most of his actual shots, and, before he knew it, he was being approached by four hungry savage beasts, with no bullets in his magazine. trying to reload it was in vain, as the terror running through his body made him drop his gun, and trying to run away, he tripped and fell down. He was now defenseless

   
*Show time* I say to myself, as I stealthily come out of my hiding spot and run towards the man. He was paralyzed in fear, as the bigger one of the zombies leapt towards him, in an attempt to bite. Holding back my shoulder tentacles, as I didn't want to blow my cover, I parry the zombie's bite, and with one hit, I knock it unconscious, and as it falls, with one swipe from my knife, I sever its throat. Damn, it was hard not to use my claws. As the big one hit the ground, a smaller one makes an attempt for my shoulder which I swiftly parry, tearing his jaw off, and kicking him in the forehead, leaving him to wait for his throat to be sliced after the fight. Using my gun, I take care of the two ones left, with one bullet for each of them. Then, I point my attention towards the man. He was shaking from every bone   
C*alm down, big guy, the danger's gone* I say in a soothing tone *There's nothing to fear*   
You fucking saved me, man he says after a few minutes I owe you big time   
*No problem. I'm the type to help people when they need it. So tell me,* I ask while helping him get up *What's your name?*   
*Name's Josh. Yours?*   
*I'm Mark*   
*Oh, OK, mark. Now you tell me: What the hell are you doing 'round those tunnels? Also headin' for the Shelter?*   
At this point I had no idea what he was talking about. However, the prospect of a human settlement that my lair could raid seemed promising. I was only expecting one, maybe two kills that would keep me going for the week, but now the prize at stake was way greater.   
*Yes, the settlement indeed. You see, my good friend told me about it, but I am not totally sure how to get there*   
*Oh, I see. Well, we're a closed settlement, but You're a good guy. I'll get you in*   
*Thank you so much. Can you tell me more about this "Shelter"?*   
*Well,  it's situated in the building of the school nr.142. We are about fifty people, surviving together. Defending ourselves against zombies and vampires. We aren't really that well-prepared against vampires though*   
At this point, I knew this was the time to land the kill. There was nothing more he could help me with.   
*Thank you, friend* I say as I get threateningly close to josh's neck, and with a well placed bite, and a hard tentacle point to the heart, I kill him, and drink the blood. I finally felt my thirst quenched. After looting the body, I check the time. It was 2:30 in the night, so I figured I could get out, and head directly for my lair  It was a quick walk for a vampire, especially in the night with very few people to worry about, as few humans had adapted to being nocturnal.   
Entering the lair, I felt the welcoming greetings of my lair mates.    
*Alright, friends* I yell as hard as possible. *Tomorrow, we are headed towards school number 142! The humans have a settlement there. Tomorrow, we are feasting on their blood first thing at twilight!* 

Sorry for any possible grammar mistakes, I'm extremely tired. Also, the whole story takes place in Bucharest
