"I have to bring you in," I told him. "You were wanted for five different accounts of murder. You were a very bad man in the past."

"But I don't remember," he said, his eyes welling up with tears.

"I know you don't, but the Department of Justice and this tracker do," I motioned towards the machine. "We need you to serve your sentence to pay for your crimes. You were a very bad man in the past. Understand?"

He nodded. As I went to secure him in a set of handcuffs, a woman behind him pulled him towards her while he cried in her arms.

"How are you so sure that thing is accurate?" she asked. "Surely, there's some margin of error that needs to be worked out."

"No, m'am, there isn't." I told her. "No two souls are exactly alike. Each life they live through imprints the soul with distinct markers. You'd have a better chance finding two exact set of fingerprints or two exact sequences of DNA."

"But people can change though, can't they? Just because they lived a horrible life in the past doesn't mean they will turn out to live a horrible life in the present."

"M'am, it's called the Department of Justice not the Department of Fortune Tellers. This is a case where five life sentences need to be carried out and suicide does not satisfy any of the life sentences."

"My son didn't do anything!" she yelled, with her son's face buried in her arms. "How can you punish him for something that another person did in the past?"

"Unfortunately, your son *is* that very same person and this is just the way our Justice System works. The DoJ recognizes your son as a serial killer who still has leftover life sentences. The sooner you let him go, the sooner he can serve them."

"But.." she said as she looked at him in anguish. "He's just a kid! I've raised him as my pride and joy for seven years and now you come out of nowhere demanding that he go to federal prison? What kind of justice is that?!"
