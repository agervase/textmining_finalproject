I'm a Reddit imposter, I have to confess. I know little about the functionality of the site beyond the communities I'm subscribed to. I know how to comment, vote, and subscribe, but that's about it. I strictly scroll through the app when I have nothing better to do. 


Last night, I couldn't sleep. It was 2am, and I had to be up for work at 5, as usual. I laid there for a while, begging my brain to turn off, but it wouldn't. Accepting defeat, I rolled over and grabbed my phone from the nightstand and commenced checking my social media platforms. *Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, repeat.* 


Oddly enough, nothing was happening at 2am on those apps, so I switched over to Reddit. I was scrolling through my subs, but became bored quickly. *"What does this 'random' button do?"*, I wondered, and clicked it. I clicked through a couple of times, smiling at the subs it recommended to me. 


The smile dropped off my face the third time I clicked it. In big letters the sub proclaimed "PRACTICED-COMPASSION". I clicked it and brought up the posts. There were posts from weeks ago, talking about my new pants and my obsession with *Boy Meets World* reruns. A post from last week talked about my birthday and judged me for all the beer I'd drank. A post that had been heavily downvoted criticized my taste in music, expressing disgust at my obsession with Broadway musical soundtracks. 


The closer I got to the top, the more creeped out I became. Who were these people? How did they know me?


One user seemed to be my "number 1 fan", so to speak. He (or she) called himself "unpracticed-compassion" (clever, I thought), and heavily praised whatever I'd been doing. My choice in meals, the books I read and-my stomach sank-what kind of car I drove. 


I wildly scrolled back to the top and saw a recent post had been added by *unpracticed-compassion*. It simply said, "HEY." I opened it and read, "*I love your comforter. The green matches your eyes.*" 


Then my bedroom door clicked open.
