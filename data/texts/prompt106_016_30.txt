ELLIE...

She looked up at me, eyes rimmed in red. For a moment, she was the girl who first saw me again, all those years ago. Then she wiped the tears from her cheeks and forced herself to smile.

"I was worried... I thought maybe you wouldn't..."

ALWAYS, ELLIE. IT'S WHAT I DO.

"I know. I just thought... you might not. Because of me."

I'M SORRY. I KNOW IT'S BEEN... DIFFICULT, FOR YOU.

"Difficult? Yes, that's a good word for it." She smiled; a real smile this time. "At least I made sure that the bitch got what she deserved."

THE BITCH, IN THIS CASE, WAS YOUR MOTHER.

"No! She stopped being my mother when she murdered Dad!"

It was how she'd first seen me: a small girl, sobbing silently as she watched through a crack in the cupboard door while her mother and her uncle - her mother's lover - murdered her father in cold blood, while he was relaxing in a spa pool. Her father was no angel, either - I'd met him often, during the war, as he dispatched the enemies of his country. But to meet him again like that, a survivor of the war, finally come home, only to be murdered by the woman he trusted most of all? It had been disturbing, even to me - and I have literally seen everything. For Ellie; well, her mental state stood as testament to the effect at had on her impressionable young mind.

Ellie had set out on the only logical course of action to her: vengeance. Long, cold, studied vengeance.  
She traveled abroad, and studied with foreign masters to learn the art of inflicting pain. She learned the way of the sword, the spear, the bow - any weapon she could carry. She apprenticed under the greatest strategic minds the world had to offer, to add their cool calculus to her plans for retribution.  
And all the while, she practiced her bloody work, perfecting her murderous art - saving her masterpiece for the perfect canvas: her mother.

We saw each other a lot during that part of her life.  
And for a time, we were... close.

I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER, ELLIE. YOU MADE THAT QUITE CLEAR LAST TIME WE SPOKE.

---

That night is still clear to me, even now. Ellie stood, bathed in her mother's blood - and a twisted, broken body at her feet.

"You're here?" Ellie gasped when she recognized me.

YES.

"But... She doesn't deserve it! She doesn't deserve you!"

THIS IS WHAT I DO, ELLIE.

"You know what she did to my father; to me! How can you help her?"

I MUST, ELLIE. IF NOT ME, THEN WHO?

"No one! That's the point! She deserves to suffer!"

SHE HAS, ELLIE. FOR HOURS. YOU HURT HER A LOT.

BUT NO MORE.  
NOW, SHE WALKS WITH ME.

"Don't!" Ellie cried, almost pleading. "Don't take her. Please. Let her stay."  
"For me."

IT IS HER TIME.

Ellie screamed for a long time; she did not stop until well after I'd faded from view.

---

"I was wrong," Ellie apologized. "I thought... I thought that was what I was meant to do. I thought that was what I wanted."  
"In time, I came to realize... I realized that what I wanted? It was you. I love you. I always have."

For a moment, I vividly recalled holding that little girl's hand while her father died.

I'M SORRY, ELLIE. I LOVE YOU. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU. BUT WE CANNOT BE TOGETHER.

"You love me? So then why can't we be together?"

I LOVE ALL HUMANS, ELLIE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS SEEN ME, BUT I WAS WITH YOU, EVERY DAY; EVERY MOMENT; EVERY WAKING BREATH. I NEVER LEFT - I WAS THERE; I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE.  
WITH YOU.  
WITH EVERYBODY.

AND WHILE I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED BEING WITH YOU LONGER... I motioned to her corpse, lying on the floor between us.

"I did it for you," Ellie answered. "I couldn't live without you! But now, now we can be together!"

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, ELLIE. I'M AFRAID IT IS TIME FOR **YOU** TO LEAVE ME.

"But... I don't want to go!" she screamed. "I want to stay here, with you!"

VERY FEW HUMANS EVER WANT TO GO, ELLIE. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO EITHER.  
AND YET, YOU MUST. THIS PLACE IS FOR THE LIVING. YOU CANNOT STAY.

Reluctantly, I escorted Ellie through the doors on to the black desert under the endless night.
