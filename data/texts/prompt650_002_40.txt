Sometimes, reality can be whatever you want.

&#x200B;

When the Avengers showed up at Site-19, MTF scrambled to action. The site temporarily went into lockdown. The Alpha and Omega warheads were armed and ready.

All cooperative SCPs with mild combat ability were called.

I remember this conversation clear as day.

"What do you want?", Site Director Lahm said."The safety of billions," said Tony Stark.

Humans are a fickle thing. Some people are as easily controlled as dogs. Others, though, are steely eyed missile men, with wills of steel and hearts of iron.

The SCP Foundation does not recruit dogs.

"We will try."

&#x200B;

When the final Infinity Stone was given, the Avengers expected horrors. Monsters of old, from tales that astonished. Instead, they got a handshake, a salute, and a promise to "try their hardest." Their and our hardest, as it turns out, was very, *very* ***hard.***

&#x200B;

Hours and hours later, Thanos arrived. As expected, he showed ability to track the Time Stone. Site-19 was under attack within minutes.

But he was not met with spears and bows, or rocks and torches, or pitchforks.

&#x200B;

**He was met with anomalies.**

&#x200B;

All nonessential MTF squads were called to the area. SCP-682 was given the choice to kill Thanos, or remain in containment. 173 was put in a box and let loose in an empty area essential to getting to the Time Stone. A single picture of 096 was taken, and put on the wall on the third essential corridor. MTF-Omega-9, "Scrubs", chose to rescind their previous rule. 914 was used to create high-tech weaponry. 963 was sequestered in the second to final room, and the Avengers; the Avengers were set as the last failsafe.  Scranton Reality Anchors were unused, as they were too expensive to produce and move on such a tight timeframe.

&#x200B;

The perfect storm. A final stand. This was all they could do on such short notice, but they kept their last weapons tightly under wraps.

&#x200B;

Thanos breezed past 682, 173, and 096. MTF-Omega-9 were unsuccessful, even with 914's "Operator Weapons." Doctor Bright, even with full use of chainsaws, couldn't kill the mad Titan. The Avengers failed.

&#x200B;

Half of everyone died. The end was nigh.

&#x200B;

But the SCP Foundation does ***not*** recruit dogs.

Their final weapon, their endgame, their last resort was unleashing upon Thanos the combined fury of nations worldwide, companies, and every single contained SCP which would not destroy the world. Thanos didn't stand a chance. Bells ringing, phantom forces, crescent moons, music, 3312, all of Site-13. SCPs were everywhere. Even the hostile SCPs joined with the Foundation researchers and MTF, the pure joy of the hunt compelling them past their genocidal tendencies.  SCP-2000 was unnecessary.

Sometimes, reality can be whatever you want. Sometimes, it can't.

The SCP Foundation? They will do whatever it takes to make sure it can't. They- **we** will do whatever it takes to:

Secure.

Contain.

**Protect.**

&#x200B;

Now get out there and start rebuilding humanity, people.
