We all knew Trump's Mexican border wall wouldn't solve all America's immigration problems---but only I knew why.

On my stake-outs in the deserts of Arizona and Texas, I could sometimes see them practicing. They leapt so high that the moon was eclipsed by their wide-brimmed sombreros. They grabbed its fabric in both hands and parachuted for miles, silently laughing at fences and walls, landing in whichever country they chose.

But if you know anything about REAL politics, you know it's the Canadian border we need to worry about. 

His white costume was camouflage in the icy winter, but I could still see him, because he wasn't hiding the bright-red maple leaf on his chest. We stood across the American-Canadian border, a great slash of trees cut out of the forest like an immature "no-touching zone."

"You stay on your side," I reminded him with a shout. "That's the deal, remember?" 

"Times are changing, eh. Do you know how many ninja-nationalities are on your side of the border right now?"

"Just one nationality here," I said. "United States of American." 

"I'm sure, eh." He turned and started to walk away. "But it's all changing, after Brexit."

"Those kingdoms are far from here."

"Don't forget where your fealties lie, eh. You've got as many ninjas watching London as London has watching you."

"Let London do what it wants. It won't affect us."

"Everything affects everyone, eh. France coughs, all Europe gets a cold. Don't you know, the socio-political-economic disturbance of a major breakdown in the European Union might need to be rectified in the night with some ninjas, if you know what I mean."

I smushed out a cigarette. "Is that a warning or a threat?"

"It's a warning."

"On behalf of whom?"

"You know my connections in Quebec." He disappeared into the white night. "I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you, eh."
