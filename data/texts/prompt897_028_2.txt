“Your plan is set, your party is in position.” The lanky kid at the end of the table winded down his campaign narrative. “And now the game is afoot. It’s Mo’s turn”

“The crowd is very thick, but you have a good position.” The lanky Game Master announces. "Roll for initiative.”

Mo just stares at the number on the dice. 

He groans. “Seriously?” 

The GM follows up. “An officer stands right behind you. You are spooked by the cop, and fail to act. Vas?” 

Vas rolls the dice. Then he just shakes his head. 

“And you are spooked as well. The car moves on.. Alright, Ned, its your turn. Roll for initiative”

The dice clatter. 

“You throw your bomb. It lazily sails into the air and the driver manages to spot it.” The GM announces. A quick clatter of dice.  

He continues. “The driver speeds up. The bomb harmlessly bounces off the soft convertible cover of the car and it misses your targets. “

Everyone groans. 

“But wait ..”

The dice clatter again. 

“The bomb falls into the street. Seconds tick away before it explodes. It leaves a massive crater, hitting the fourth car. Two officers are seriously wounded. ”

“That’s something at least.” Ned remarks. “Let’s hit the eject button.” 

“Taking the pill?” The GM asks. 

“Yup.“

“Ok, let’s roll for poison.” 

The die decided to show a two. 

“The capsule is decayed. You fail to poison yourself. “

Ned smacks his forehead. “Ugh. What else can I do? How about jumping in the river?”

The GM blinks. “Alright. Roll for drowning.” 

“The river is just a few inches deep. You fail to drown.” The GM quickly glances down at his board. “The police capture you. “ 

Another quick roll. 

“The crowd decides to beat you up as well.” 

Rolling.

“You take 50 points of damage.”

Ned sighs, “And I’m out of commission. Alive at least, but I'm not sure that's a good thing.” 

The GM does another quick roll. “The drivers are now on high alert and speed away to their destination. “

“That’s it then? We failed?” Ned asks. 

The GM checks his board, muttering for a few seconds. Then he pipes up. 

“The Duke arrives safely to his destination. He carries out his speech to the assembled masses, mocking your efforts. Afterwards, he decides to visit his wounded compatriots in the hospital. Then he makes a wrong turn..“

“Gav, he’s now in your sights. “

Gav smiles. 

“Rolling for initiative.”

A twenty appeared. Gav’s smile bloomed higher. 

"The car passes by you. But at that instant, the Governor shouts out to the driver to turn around. The car reverses right into your path.” The GM declares. 

Roll. 

“You hit the Duke point blank in the neck.” The GM announces. “His mistress cries out ‘Franz!’, and dives to cover him. Your second bullet hits her in the gut. They are both severely wounded and dying.” 

Gav rocks out. “Bam! take that you imperialists!”

“Getting into character a tad?” 

Gav smirked. “But I did want to get that Governor.” 

“You got the girl!” Ned yelled back at him. 

“That’s not exactly how we want to get girls.” Gav shot back. “Anyway, its pill time.”

“Rolling for poison.”

“And the pill fails. “

“I’ll use my gun.” Gav shoots back. 

The dice clatter, then sit there mocking him. 

“Some one in the crowd grabs you before you can get off your gun. You are now captured.” 

“That’s it then?” Gav asked. “This whole thing was a fiasco.” 

“But you did get your target at least?” The GM asked. 

“At what price? Two of us are captured. I’m betting the rest of us will be captured in our next session. We didn’t even kill ourselves to protect our secrets. We were ridiculously bad at being assassins.”

“We could always skip to the next campaign. I have a massive war campaign planned up that we could try.” 

“Sounds good. ”
