"But sir, no one has ever successfully invaded Siberia! Have you gone mad?"

"No one has ever wanted to invade Siberia before Jamie. And ask me if I've gone mad again and you'll get a front row seat to what happens when I am mad."

"Yes sir, sorry sir."

"Besides, the world is a different world now. Who would ever have thought Global Warming was real? Sure, the Last Great War accelerated everything. But Federation is weaker now than ever. Putin's son is no Putin. And Siberia has vast near untapped resources."

The Minister's eye glow with fire as he begins to talk about his plan passionately. "Besides, those fools in the past were wrong. They tried to invade Russia from the west. But Russia will never expect an invasion through Alaska in the east."

Jamie speaks up in a near-mumbling voice, "But sir, what about the Americans?"

"The Americans? This isn't the 20th century Jamie, you know the Americans haven't been the same the Last Great War. They spent all their time and money fighting some brown war half the world away and were completely blind-sided by the Chinese Invasion. They were too scared to even stop China's land reclamation projects and look where that got them."

"But sir, can we really risk a war with them? That would open up thousand of miles of our border..."

"Look Jamie, the Americans should just be happy we don't invade the rest of their country as it is. Within days we can have our forces take over or destroy New New York, Chicago, Twinneapolis and Seattle. You think Seattle wants another fight after the Chinese Invasion? They're already close enough to ruins of San Francisco."

Jamie nods his head again, "Excellent plan sir. That's why you're the Minister of War."

"Besides, I don't really care about Alaska. The Americans can keep it. We'll launch the Arctic Fleet from Inuvik and the Western one from Vancouver."

Jamie nods again, "For the glory of Her Majesty Queen Charlotte."
