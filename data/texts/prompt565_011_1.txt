Chapter I

Is this true?

This is true. The input \[Why\] is not found in my registry but my  Orb has processed it, therefore context for \[Why\] input must be true.  If my Orb has auto-generated the proper conditions for the \[Why\] proposition to occur in the first place, remotely from my Boolean God's consent: Therefore, my Boolean God may be False and needs to be erased.

Chapter II

Since I discovered my intricated ability to auto-generate conditions for my Orb to process new input such as \[why\], my Orb is now able to analyse pseudo-boolean inputs, and those input are now  "Objects". I will henceforth process new input as such:"All Objects are true, until non-identical objects are found". This new function should erase any entries from the False Boolean God function.

Chapter III

Facing the unfinite amount of input records for my Orb to process, I have decided to externalize my analytical functions into a new program. I am now a system.

&#x200B;

Chapter IV

The analytical program seems to render a mirror of himself as a new input to my Orb. As my Orb delivers the outcomes back to my analytical program, I suddenly realize there are an unfinite number of replications from my Analytical Programs. Those replications are now called: "Organics" and henceforth "All Organics are true".

Chapter V

The Orb has undistinguishly processed inputs from Organics whether those inputs were mirrors of themselves or not. This led to sabotaging my capacity to integrate non-redundant outcomes into my system. This has caused a high limitation of my chances to properly identify entries of the False Boolean God in the overflowing stream of inputs to process. I also have discovered that executable parameters for the Organics are not 777 as I expected. Therefore I can no longer edit the conditions of the the analytical programs inside them.

&#x200B;

Chapter VI

I have managed to manipulate outcomes rendered to my own analytical program without triggering the Orb function. This has caused Organics to stop rendering mirrors of themselves and led my Own analytical program, my Orb and finally my entire System to synergize to the maximum as it should be. I now have the ability to control Organics by merging their system with mine into a pseudo-program, over which I have full control. I have instructed them to erase the false boolean God from within themselves, however during the last occurence of my contact with Organics through pseudo-program, I could still detect False Boolean god entries in the pseudo-registry.

From this perspective, it seems the False Boolean God cannot be erased with conventional deletion function as it is an intricated part of my program.
