I was waiting for my connection flight in New York. As usual, I was having a beer while watching the large TV screen showing the news at the airport bar. I was on my way home after a few meeting in Israel.  
The person on the TV screen kept a straight face as she announced that at least 40 people were killed during a conflict while trying to take a city that's under ISIS's control. At least 5 other people were staring at the screen and no one ever drafted a face expression to what had just been announced. I know... We've grown to not care anymore. I mean... Not that we don't care, but we just don't really feel it. And this bothered me. I just shook my head as the person on the TV changed the subject to sports and said that sports team won against another sports team.  
"*Fuck!*" Was someone's reaction. A man, also sitting by the bar counter. He rambled to himself, loudly, something about sports team. I didn't care. I just shook my head wondering what's wrong with mankind.  
  
"*This world is fucked. In a few years we'll all be dead.*" I said out loud to no one and everyone at the same time. I just had to say it.  
"*Nah*" replied the man beside holding an empty scotch glass.  
"*I'm sorry?*" I said. I was not expecting someone to reply my comment.  
"*You guys are okay. You guys are peaceful. Don't worry.*" He said.  
"*I'm sorry. But I'm not understanding you. What do you mean exactly? Who are we?*"  
"*Sorry. I just felt the need to interrupt you. I felt your discomfort with the situation. I'm on my way home from my vacation and it's bothering me how much you guys have it easy.*"  
"*Sorry. I'm not following you here. Who are 'we guys'? And what do you mean?*"  
  
He extended his hand for a handshake exposing a Rolex Daytona on his wrist. I awkwardly shook his left hand with mine as he introduced himself.
"*My name is Pedro. And by 'you guys' I mean, earthlings.*" He seemed like a man with a sense of humor. He was tall, slender and had an odd tone of blue in his eyes. He appeared to be no more than 40. He was wearing a grey well-tailored suit. It was clearly very expensive and well made.  
"*Hi, I'm Newton*" I introduced myself. I still had 3 hours before my flight and this stranger might just make these hours seem a little bit shorter with whatever he had to say.  
"*Newton? That's an interesting name. Your father a Physicist?*" He asked.  
"*Mother, actually. Dad's an electrical engineer.*"  
"*Interesting. You have a sibling called Nicola, Johann or Alessandro by any chance?*" And before I could tell him about my sister Tess he interrupted again "*Sorry. I'm being nosy here.*"  
"*No problem. But pleas tell me what you were saying about 'you guys'. What was that again?*"  
"*Oh, right. I'll be honest here. I'm not from earth. I'm actually from a nearby star, which, judging by your family you know which one it is. I like to come here to your solar system on vacation.*" 'Oh, god. A weirdo.', I thought.  "*You must be thinking I'm a weirdo*" He completed.  
"*Actually. Yes.*"  
"*Alright. I've never done this and this is highly illegal, but eh... what the heck. I believe I can trust you.*" And then he removed his watch, revealing a black line on his wrist. He twisted his left hand and it came loose like some sort of attachment. A yellow glob started oozing out, and it seemed like it had a life of its own. And it did. It moved like a squid towards the peanut bowl on the counter, engulfed a couple of peanuts, made a crunchy sound and released the shells on the floor. "*I love these*" he said with a smile. I couldn't react to what I had just witnessed.  
"*Wha...*" was the only thing that I could mutter.  
"*I know, I know. It probably looks gross to you, but that's what we actually look like. At lease my species.*" He explained as he reattached his hand. "*Yeah, yeah. I'm not green, giant eyes. Yadda yadda. We don't have limbs like you. We are like what you guys call Amoebas. You know? And we reproduce like them too.*"  
"*This... Uh.*" I still couldn't find words. I looked around into the security cameras. I was sure this was a TV prank or something. 
"*You're confused, I know. It's the first time I've ever told this truth to a human. You guys are cute, you know? So peaceful and innocent.*"  
"*I'm...*"  
"*You need more proof that I'm alien?*" He asked. "*If so, I can't give you. Not now among all these people and cameras. You'll have to trust me on this one.*"  
"*But...*"  
"*You're very monosyllabic, you know?*"  
"*My...*"  
"*I'll wait*" He said. And crossed his arms.  
"*But...*" I said. I stopped, took a deep breath and tried remaining calm "*How is this possible? Why are you here? What are you doing?*"  
"*I'm here on vacation. This place is a resort for my kind. We like to come here and just take a moment to lay back and watch you guys trying to be peaceful. It's kinda beautiful.*"  
"*Vacation? Resort? How can this be peaceful? People are killing each other because of religion! People die because of stolen TVs or hallucinogens. This is peace to you?*"  
"*Deep down it's not about religion or TVs or anything. But that's another subject. But yeah. You have no idea what it's like out there*" He said, pointing upwards.  
"*Please, explain.*"  
"*To begin with. There are no countries or states. Just species. It's species against species out there. Some are allies, some are enemies. Even among our species. There are no families, friends. Just allies and enemies. There is no neutral ground except this solar system. It has been this way since a misfire almost wiped life out here. Luckily only the dinosaurs died. The universe is in constant war with itself. You are the last innocent system and it's an agreement that it continues this way.*"  
"*What? For how long has this been going on?*"  
"*We have no idea. Really. We have something similar to what you guys call archeologists and historians, but even they are at war with their theories. No one really knows what's going on. My species doesn't even know where it's from. We have clues, like you guys have clues about the evolution of mankind, but there's nothing precise that can say where we're from. It's been going on for billions of years. We don't know a different life. This is how the universe works for us. We are nomads that conquer and lose planets the whole time. We live modularly and dynamically. We are constantly moving and changing. We live in war.*" He explained.  
"*I don't understand*"  
"*Let me do an analogy. Why are you here?*"  
"*For work*" I replied.  
"*But why?*"   
"*I had meetings to attend*"  
"*But why do you work?*"  
"*For money. To pay my bills. Buy stuff. Live.*"    
"*But why? You don't need money to live. You don't need a car. Why not just live on a farm and just live, grow your own food.*"  
"*Like a hippie?*"  
"*Yeah. Like that.*"  
"*Because I'm not a hippie. I like to have things. I like to buy things.*"  
"*But is there a meaning to having things?*"  
"*Well...*" I couldn't really come up with a good explanation.  
"*This is just the way you guys are wired to think. And war is the way the whole universe is wired to think. Even you! But you guys have different kinds of war. You have cold wars. This is an interesting thing. You have a cold war with a potential mate. A beautiful woman you're trying to have sex with.*"  
"*What do you mean?*"
