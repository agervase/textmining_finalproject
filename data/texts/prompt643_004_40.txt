"Confess, or submit to sweep?"

The dreaded words.  The last words anyone in here remembers before being locked up.  No one here remembers what they did... they have to remind themselves every day that they must deserve to be here, lest they go insane.  Most cry out their innocence and beg to be set free.  Some claim they've been rehabilitated from crimes they don't even remember.  All of them are just wasting their breath.

People often try to trick it - they hold on to every shred of hope that a look through their memories will be less damning than the words out of their mouth.  It takes some doing, but some of the most twisted individuals have escaped it, distorting their own mind and memories into something completely different.  The black market for mind altering is booming, but it leaves traces of tampering behind and living with a false memory is its own kind of hell.  Hardly worse than living without one.  Almost all of them out there try to change their memories back with a bullet.

They don't tell you how it really is.  They tell you that if they take the memory, you'll lose it.  But what that means... No one is prepared to be locked in a small box for something they can't even remember.

But me.  I remember.

"I confess," said I.

"I walked into the house and saw Coral - saw my wife - screaming at her.  At my daughter.  Our daughter." *Her lifeless body on the ground.*

"The fear in my baby's eyes... I just snapped." *Remorseless.  Hollow.*

"I just... I snapped, okay?  She seemed like she was going to hurt Lily so I.. I grabbed the kitchen knife and stabbed Coral." *I'm sorry, Coral.  I love you.*

"I stabbed her and I just kept stabbing until she went limp.  Then I... and then I took the blade and drove it into her face, for good measure.  No one hurts my baby girl.  Not even... not even her."  *Not even me.*

&#x200B;

They dragged me away after that, but I remember.  I remember getting home and walking in on a horror, seeing my baby girl standing over the love of my life, both drenched in blood.  *Be good, princess... daddy can only protect you one last time.*

I remember everything.

I wish they could take the memory away.
