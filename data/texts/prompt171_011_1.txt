"Excuse me."

The Clerk looked up from his desk, "Hello, how may I--" the clerk stopped and searched for the owner of the soft voice.

"I'm down here." The Clerk stood up from his chair and looked over the counter.  A small pink *thing* regarded him from several meters away.

"Greetings..." The Clerk paused and tried to think back to the PowerPoint presentation they'd given him on alien taxonomy. He gave up and continued, "--how may I help you?" he said, hedging his bets and avoiding pronouns.

"I'd like to--" the pink *thing's* voice became inaudible as it searched for something in its tiny briefcase. The Clerk couldn't decided if he found it cute or disgusting.

"I'm sorry, but could you please repeat that?" The Clerk leaned over the desk. The marble countertop cut into his food processing organs. His abdomen made a rumbling noise.

The pink *thing* handed The Clerk a folded up sheet of paper with a grunt. The Clerk took it and unfolded it.

The pink *thing* wiped its brow and said, "I was sent this document. I apologize for being late. It took up nearly half the living room to read; my wife was very angry with me. You see she purchased this star and--"

The Clerk stopped listening. He brushed the tip of his sight organ over the official golden seal. There was no doubt, it was real. He stared at the pink *thing* and nervously licked at his ommatophores. His skin was getting chapped; he really needed to call about getting the air conditioner fixed. Even the visitors had started to complain that their ocular tubers were getting too dry.

"Hello?" the pink thing said, lifting itself up on it two small ambulators, no doubt to better see The Clerk.

The Clerk shook his head, "I apologize. I've just never--" The PowerPoint had not prepared him for this, "-- Not a worry! Welcome to Z'Mxyrdax, Arch Hegemon," he paused, Terran names were so hard to pronounce, "Kevin. I will contact the Prime Minister immediately and alert him to your arrival, o' gracious overlord."
