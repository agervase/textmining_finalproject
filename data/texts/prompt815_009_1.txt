“Twenty four watermelons and thirty six apples please.”

“That would be $3 per watermelon and $1 per apple, sir.”

Wait, what? What the heck am I doing here? I am pretty sure I don’t have any plans to open a juice stall.And the price! Where in the world does an apple cost a dollar?

Three times twenty four equals sixty two. Thirty six times one equals thirty six. Thirty six plus sixty two equals ninety eight dollars. Phew, that was easy. And I think I have a fairly good idea where I am now. No, the grocer’s is not the answer, smart ass. I am inside a math problem. Yes, that’s a  good explanation for this.  

“ Here’s the money, mister, and since it is pretty apparent that I cannot carry twenty four watermelons with me, get them delivered to my house, will you? “

And with that, I set off towards my home. With an air of confidence similar to Caesar when he had set out of his house on that fateful day. Like Caesar, I too was unaware of the dangers that awaited me.

My wife now wouldn’t serve me dinner and told me to live on apples and watermelons.“It was in the spirit of maths!” But she, a history professor would never understand that.

To add to this agony, the apples and watermelons did not arrive. I called the grocer’s, but it said the number was unreachable. I went there again. But instead of a grocer's, there was a school.

The Mandela Effect anyone?

I met my high school maths teacher inside whose face turned into a instant scowl upon seeing me. 

She took a pot of red ink from her bag and emptied its contents out on me.
