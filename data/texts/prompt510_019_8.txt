"Hey baby, smile" it came as a surprise to her. She had never been 'catcalled' before. What do you do in such a situation? Her mind was racing now. "Should she respond? And what should the response be? How is he not petrified of her now?" And while her mind was at it, she was staring blankly at him. 
He was a scrawny man in his late teens. Not particularly handsome, but he had a certain anti-charm. People who walked past him got irritated by him. He was like a filter to the street. Every person who passed him in the street had visible negative emotions on their face. They hated him, or were disgusted. One older gentleman had anger on his face. He probably wanted to punch this guy's face in. Now she wanted to punch his face in. 
He kept going and now his remarks started getting more vulgar. "Those melons, Ooooh.... " he started making noises now. And it stirred something in her too. She hated him with all the hate inside her. And she had unlimited hatred inside her. She was from hell. She wanted to kill him. That was what she was here for. To take him with her, to save these people from him. To take him to hell. She loved to hear people like him scream in horror. People who wasted all their lives making other people miserable. 
All she had to do was touch him. She walked two steps towards him but froze. This man was not horrified of her. The reality of the situation dawned on her. When he saw her, he saw an angel. She had been called the angel of death before, but that was only a metaphor. What if he always saw her this way. She was going to take him in for eternity after all. What if she had to deal with him everyday. I'm hell, there were no rooms. Everyone kept away from her out of sheer fear. This guy would never leave her. A million years of her future played out in front of her.
"Hey, mami, you wanna come home with me". He blew her a kiss. She turned away and ran into the crowd.
