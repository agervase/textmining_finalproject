I woke up. I opened my eyes. Sitting up. Looking round. 

I didn't feel different. I thought I asked for strength, critical hits, and dexterity. Nothing....(moves elbow in a circle)...feels--DAMMIT. 

Something's wrong. I should be stronger. Stronger than anyone else. Smarter than the famous Einstein(the lucky bastard), I should feel...not like me.

A couple of years went by. I knew I distributed everything wrong. I placed everything on *Luck*. Luck. Luck of the Irish. Lucky to be here...lucky to win... Lucky to see...lucky to sin. I got a raise every year and I bought a nicer house than what I had before. Not great, but I gained 3 extra rooms. In another year our CEO died while on a Disney Cruise Ship, and I got promoted to Vice President. I was making more money than God. But I didn't have that strength I asked for, and wisdom, and dexterity. I placed everything on luck. 

Two years I meet Jennifer. Beautiful in every way. She's playful, but she's serious. She's a joy, she makes you delirious. We got married, vacationed in Italy for a month, stayed an extra month; and by way of Paris we came home. Two children graced us with their presence, their love. I had these things. These beautiful treasures, but I didn't have what I asked for, strength, wisdom, and dexterity. What the fuck does dexterity mean? Isn't it the same as strength? I feel like every point I get is precious and I should only be using those points for one thing. Sorry. I'm rambling. 

All these years go by, but I realize I didn't get what I asked for: strength--you know. Because I put everything on luck. At my twilight, at the end. I realize this small thing:

I was the luckiest son of a bitch in the world. ShaaaKAAAAA!!!!!
