Ive never submitted anything- and hopefully this doesn't suck as much as I think it does. 


He came in through my window, creeping slowly through the bedroom door, down the hall into the bathroom and that's when my father crumbled to the floor. 

As he left, he turned to me and that's when I caught the grey in his dark eyes. I soon fell under his spell and forgot about my poor fathers demise. 

Although it was My fathers soul, he intended to take  - he had no way of knowing that it was my love he'd awake.  

From a child to a girl, to a woman I grew and yet he never returned.  That's the moment that I knew. 

My stepfather who abused me, my mother and her lies, my brother who tortured me - everybody. everybody dies. 

My mother got the ax, my brother got the gun, my step father well - he got the chainsaw just for fun. 

As I stood in the blood of those I hated the most - the smoke slowly rolled in and in walked my ghost. 

He collected the souls that he came to take - "wait." I called to him. "Don't - don't go." My voice begins to break.

"My need for you, my want for you, my love - it grows deeper.   Everything I've done- I've done for you, please stay my darling reaper. "

"My soul is black, and my heart - well it's gone 
Stop, foolish girl. Your thoughts? They are wrong."

"But I love you." I begged 
Silence, was his reply 
"Say something.. say anything. Please." I cry. 

"Take me with you- I'll go. I can be your  queen of the dead. I'll be the beat in your heart and the warmth in your bed." 

"You kill for a love that will never exist, you pine for the dead- you beg- you persist.  I will not take you with me - and that is true - there is nothing you can say. There is nothing you can do." 

But there is one thing I have, a trick up my sleeve - a Pistol with a bullet loaded, cocked and ready, just for me.  "We will be together soon."   "Oh" he asked. "How do you figure?" That's when I put the gun in my mouth and in that moment, pulled the trigger.
