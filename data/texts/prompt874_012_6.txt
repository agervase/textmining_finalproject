He's old.  Older than most people have any right to be.  When he showed up in the hospital, everyone started to panic.  There were rumors, and then there were all the people he healed.  Worrying that his last day might be their own.

After a while, the doctors had reassured everyone.  Healing took hold, and faded once things were set right.  Few were truly in danger, and most of those found other healers to refresh the spell.  In time, the panic faded, but there were still some rumors floating around, every so often.

Most of them were nonsense, but noone knew much about his past, so they continued.  Some even said he was older than anyone knew.  That he spoke the word of Beginning and that the world would fade when he did.  Most people didn't listen.  He was old, but he wasn't *that* old.

He's been like this for most of a year now, and I've been thinking more and more about what he told me as a child.  About the cycle, the balance, how the world works, the life in the hearts of man.  I didn't used to think much about it, but lately... He always told me about how each one of us carries the fire of life within us.  And after such a large life, I've been thinking that it's time he finally got to rest.

So here I am.  Not many people knew about me, but they let me visit him.  To say goodbye.  I took out the amulet he always wore under his shirt and stared into it.  The brilliant fire in the small gemstone at its heart, always dancing, like the spirit of life itself.

I kissed him on the forehead.  I said goodbye, and thank you.  And I read that little word, dancing in the fire, that I could never fully make out when I was little.  

And I spoke the word of beginning.  Now it's my turn to carry the flame.  Rest in peace.
