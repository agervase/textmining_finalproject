"Look at his hair for crying out loud!" John shouted to Marie - his wife -, pointing towards his new-born son. "He was born 3 weeks ago and he's got red spiky hair!" 
"I mean, maybe it's just a mutation or something..." she responded, glancing towards the baby. 
"Marie..." John sighed "He jumped out of the crib, and fashioned a sword and shield using a wooden spoon and the garbage bin cover... At 3 weeks old, too. I'm not against our son wanting to help others or something but I'm not going to have the next Superman, or something. I can't deal with that sort of stress." John looked over to his son, who at this point had stood his pillow up and started punching it. John looked towards his own feet, shaking his head. 
"Look" Marie began to speak, stepping in front of the crib and hiding it from John's view. "Maybe it isn't such a bad thing. We're under military rule, and they tend to execute people who they suspect are thinking the wrong things... maybe it isn't so bad to have someone who could stand up to them?" 
John stared at Marie for a while, grabbing her by the shoulders and turning her to towards their son. While hugging her from behind, head on her shoulder he began to speak. "I want that too... But not our son. Not us. We're just not cut out for that sorta thing." The baby turned to them both, smiling, spiky red hair ,overly-developed muscles and all. "I guess we'll just have to find a way to deal with it" Marie said, heaving to lift the muscle-bound baby out of his crib and away from his punching-bag pillow.

So I think this is the first thing I've ever posted in the sub, so sorry if it sucks. If you have any ideas on how I could improve, shoot.
