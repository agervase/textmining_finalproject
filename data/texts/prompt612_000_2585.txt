"*What now?*" says a croaky, quiet voice.

My head is heavy and the flashlights are like razors to my eyes. "*What?*"

"What now?" hisses the man. I can't quite see his face behind the glare of his light.

There are more of them in the room with us. Other figures drenched in darkness. I can hear their breathing.

"Look Liam," he whisperers heavily. "This was your plan. We're going to give you full credit for it. But if anything bloody well goes wrong, well, like I said: it's *your plan*. So, just tell me: is it a yes, or a no?"

Shit! He -- me -- has done it again. I've been possessed by this... *other me*. I run a hand down my face. I usually feel groggy after he lets go and it always takes time to piece together what's happened. I try to think: Where was I last time I had control? I was... I think I was getting ready for work. About to catch a flight for a business trip -- Oh shit, if we lose the Redman account...

This isn't the first time, of course. But the more often this other me -- this other Liam -- has taken control, the more adept he seems to have become at *keeping* control. He takes my body for longer periods of time. And what he's been doing... the situations he's been leaving me in... Has it all been building up to *this?* A shiver races down my spine.

The first time it ever happened, I thought I'd been sleep-walking. I awoke in a graveyard by a church that I used to attend as a kid. It was nighttime, raining heavily, and I was drenched. Father Golding saw my silhouette wandering between graves and yelled at me, threatening to call the police. When he saw who it was -- recognised me from the kid who used to attend his services -- he asked what I was doing out there in this weather. I had no answer -- I had no family or friends buried there. And unlike mom, I wasn't religious. 

He brought me into the church and gave me a change of clothes. I looked like an overgrown altarboy as I walked home that night.

Two weeks later it happened again. I woke the next morning to find a note on my bedside table. In my own handwriting.

> Liam,

> Let me introduce myself: My name is Liam. Yes, that's right. I am *you*. However, I am also *not* you. I am a Liam dreaming about you. Well, now I just sound weird, don't I? Look, I don't know how this works exactly, but I can dream about you -- kind of on purpose. And when I do... For a little while, I borrow you. I *become* you.

> I'm very sorry about the cold you caught when I borrowed you that first time. I shouldn't have let you get so soaked, but I needed to check something. I'll try to make it up to you... by giving you all the riches in the world.

> Liam :)


He did *not* make it up to me. 

He, in this order: ruined my relationship with my then girlfriend; tried to get me purposely fired from my job; flirted outrageously with a pretty barista, that I've had a crush on for years (I can't show my face in there again!); most recently: applied for a *new* job at a local bank. 

I currently have a much better job than that. At least, a higher paying job. So why apply?

It's the job at the bank I'm worried about right now.

*Did I get the job?*

Am I about to get something more than a paycheck?


"Liam!" the voice hisses again. "Is it a yes or a no?!"

The speaker is getting agitated.

Static crackles, coming from my waist. "-- *incoming*."

It's a radio. No, a walkie-talkie. The voice on the other end is distorted, but I hear the words this time: "Repeat, target is incoming. ETA: 30 seconds."

My heart is thumping against my ribcage as if demanding to be let out. Sweat dribbles down my forehead. *What the hell has he got me into?!*

"Yes or no?!" 

"I..."  What if I say no? What will they do to me?

"ETA: 15 seconds."

"**Yes or no?!**"

I don't know what I'm answering, but the pressure explodes as a single word, "YES!"

Then there's silence, the flashlights are turned off. A hand tugs my shoulder and pulls me down beneath a table. 

There's a *click* and a *creak* as a door opens. A ray of light spears the darkness of the room.

I hear our mark's footsteps.

*Oh God, I hope we're not going to kill them*

"3...2...1..." 

It all happens at once. The lights on the ceiling explode into life; two dozen people jump up at the same time, previously hidden behind tables and seats and nooks in the room. I don't know where we are, but the room is large and decorated with balloons and buntings.

"Surprise!" they shout in unison. "Happy birthday!"

"Mom?" I whisper, as the lady who has just walked in places her hands on her cheeks. A smile rises, creasing the skin around her pale blue eyes.

The man next to me puts an arm around my shoulder. "You did good, lad."  I look at him:  I've not seen him in years. I barely recognise him. *But I do.*

"Uncle Fred?"

He lets go of me and pushes me forward.

"Your son's idea, Moira," uncle Fred shouts. "Organized the entire thing. Including the live band -- they'll be here in ten minutes." He looks at me and winks. "I think you made the right choice there, Liam." 

My mom is crying as she hugs me. I feel my own lips trembling.

As we pull away, and mom goes to hug her brother, I notice a girl with eyes like coffee beans the other side of the room. She walks over to me; I swallow. "Thank you for inviting me," she says. "This whole thing is just *soooo* adorable." She leans forward and kisses my cheek. "And..." She runs a hand through her hair. "I'd kind of been wondering when you were going to ask me out."

It's not till after the party that I discover the note in my jacket pocket.

> Liam,

> You're one of the lucky few who still has mom around. Maybe appreciate her a little more while you've got her. I wish for all the world that I had done. 

> I'm sorry about your ex, but know that she cheated on you in every reality. Including yours.

> Claire, on the other hand, is perfect for you. The happiest *yous* are always with Claire. And not just because she makes an unbelievable espresso. It's like a universal law: you two attract. Belong. 

> Oh, and congratulations on the new job!  The old one was killing you. Literally. There are realities I can no longer dream my way into. That was the one common denominator. 

> Take care, Liam,

> Love, Liam
