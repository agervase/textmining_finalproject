The name's Enji. I'm more commonly known as Ultraman, the superhero of Tokyo. Yet I don't know why.

I used to just live a normal life. Now everybody treats me like a superhero, and criminals always surrender when I confront them. I still don't know if I even have any superpowers.

I was walking home one day to my apartment after I got some groceries. At the store, people gave me the same old treatment: "Oh my gosh! It's Ultraman! He's the best!" It's the same on the street as well. 

I'm just minding my own business when someone calls out my name.

"Ultraman! Help! Muscleman is attacking the city!" A woman calls out from the opposite end of the street. I run towards her. 

"Where did you see him?" I ask.
"He's a few blocks down! Oh, please hurry!" The woman runs away. I book it down the road until Muscleman appears. 

"HAHAHA! DIE!" Muscleman shouts as he throws innocent people into nearby buildings. He continues this until he sees me.

"What? Oh no, it's Ultraman!" He looks at me, scared.

I walk towards him menacingly.

"Stop this, Muscleman!" I firmly yell.

"I wi-... hmm..." He almost surrendered. A big smirk then appeared on his face.

"What if I DON'T!?" He says as he throws another person.

"Then I'll... do THIS!" I punch him right in the face. To my shock, yet also to my amazement, he is lit on fire. I stare at my hand, engulfed in fire. I've discovered my power. I smile, then burst out laughing. I can do something with this.

It's been ten years since this happened. I'm still a superhero, and I'm still saving people in Tokyo to this day. My name's Enji. Enji Todoroki. I don't call myself Ultraman anymore, no. I am Endeavor.
