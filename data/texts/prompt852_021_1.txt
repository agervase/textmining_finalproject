For centuries it has been said that good could never succumb to evil. At the end of every story, it’s the villain who falls to the hands of a hero. No matter how close they get, or how much stronger they are, it’s the hero who claims victory in the end. 

But not this time. 

“London has fallen!”

The news is everywhere, and their horrified screams of terror are *music*. A symphony of dread that would swell the hearts of even the coldest of villains. 

Next comes France, and oh the look on their faces! 

The ‘I-fell’ tower. It’s gone. It *fell*. The event was recorded, everything is on tape, and sitting on the throne of the white house I watch it fall over and over again. 

Banks are wiped clean, all given to yours truly! Did you know you can put a price tag on happiness? Because let me tell you - it’s a very, *very* pretty penny. Extremely expensive, but all the while worth every scent if I do say so myself.

The front page to every magazine are replaced with the bolded headlines of our fallen heroes. Such a tragedy, such sorrow. Citizens weep in sadness, but I cannot help but laugh at their pity. 

Laws are no more. I’ve replaced them all with my very own. They’re taxes, land, sense of free will – it’s all mine now, and it’s never felt so *right* to be so *wrong*! 

Such power thought to be untouchable, has finally become a reality. Everything had fallen nicely into the very palms of my hands. For twisted souls such as I, we have longed for the defeat of hope, and because of that despair shall rule over all who dare say otherwise. 

The heroes have fallen! And this marks only the beginning of the end to this story’s final chapter.

*It’s my turn now.*
