"Do it, go ahead." He looked at the doctor in a polarizing gaze, Dr. Speer froze at the sight of two blue piercing eyes. "Now, this procedure will involve you being unconscious for a time. How long that is, depends entirely on you." 

The unnamed volunteer relaxed in his gurney, tensing for just a moment, before accepting the gravity of his situation. His arms and legs restrained, he sighed, "I would do anything, just to see that they're safe."

"Right." Dr. Speer paused. "I am surprised that anyone responded to this request so quickly... You were the first, and the only one to heed this call."
"Anything to help a fan." Replied the volunteer. 
Dr. Speer looked upon the volunteer in a gaze of curiosity, and bewilderment. He lifted the syringe with the cocktail that would induce the coma, he flicked it twice, moving the trace air bubbles to the needle; followed with a lite plunge of the syringe. 

"I do hope you know, you are the only hope to save these people... You know, I saw you in '98 I thought what you people you do as a profession was foolish. But I believe you will persevere."

The Volunteer looked at the doctor, and faintly muttered. "Get on with it, I don't need your praise." Dr. Speer shrugged, and with out pause injected the syringe into the Volunteer's IV. 

As his world faded to black, a strange Melody began ringing in the Volunteer's ear. Soft at first, but continued to gain more volume as the cocktail took it's toll. 

A last smirk was all the Volunteer displayed before passing. The doctor watched over and quietly muttered, "he is our last hope to rid this evil from this place. If he is not as strong and fails, he will suffer worse than the people under it's power. Should he fail at least the few will know his name, and his name was John Cena."
