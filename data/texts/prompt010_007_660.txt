“Nobody’s spoken that language in thousands of years.” Whispered the cashier, dropping my McNuggets. “I thought I was the last one! I can’t believe there’s more survivors! I mean, you skin is a little more pale than I would expect but who cares? Follow me, we need to talk!”

“But my McNuggets” I said

“Don’t worry, I’ll make you however many nuggets you want if you come sit and talk with me.”

I shrugged and decided I would entertain this guy. I wasn’t really listening to what he was saying but I wanted to entertain this little crazy man. We sat down in a small booth far away from anymore McDonalds connoisseurs and he started to talk. 

“So, how did you escape? What do you remember? Are there more like you and me out there?”

“Look buddy I have no idea what you’re talking about, escape from what?”

“From the earthquake of course! What else would I be talking about?”

“There was an earthquake? What language are you hearing right now exactly?”

“ATLANTEAN OF COURSE!”

Now this threw me back. 
“What? Atlantis is fake my guy.” 

“Well then why are you speaking fucking Atlantean?”

“I’m not, I’m just talking! What happened in ‘Atlantis’ that I should be worried about, hmmm?”

A look of sadness and remembrance came over his face. 
“Well I’m from there. Over 1000 years ago my island was swallowed by the ocean. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis... they plowed over my island and I was lucky to have been on a traders ship outside of Atlantis’ main port.”

“What makes you think I’m going to believe you?” I said, actually quite curious now. Either he was a good actor or telling the truth. 

“Well, Atlanteans live forever unless killed, and since I’ve been around for that long I have some pretty neat stuff back home that might convince you.”

“As long as you get me my fucking McNuggets.”

Hey r/WritingPrompts , long time lurker first time poster here. I left a lot of plot holes, I know. But the first thing I thought of was Atlantis and I wanted to do something with it. I have an idea for more of this story but my formatting and the gaps between my dialogue made me cringe too much to keep going. 

Don’t tear me apart pls
