Do you understand what it feels like to live everyday filled with sadness? I'd rather take someone's regret or tears than being an unfeeling zombie, but sometime's I imagine if my donation box, filled with those unwanted emotions, is any good at all.  At what was supposed to be the happiest times of my life have instead been replaced with melancholy. Do you understand what having these negative emotions at every given moment is like? Any chance at a romantic relationship is ruined and people never hangout with me because, trust me, I can be a real buzzkill. It sucks, in fact this whle "donation box" thing is more or less masochistic. Why am I even doing this anymore?  
  
  I thought about it more. I'm really done with this shit. Maybe being an emotionless zombie can even score me a date or two, I mean some girls are into that right? Adds a little mysteriousness after all. As I resolved myself to throw out my donation box, an unfamiliar presence filled my soul. *A new emotion*. What could it be? I thought I experienced every miserable emotion there is to existence, but as this new emotion filled my spirit, I realized it could only be one thing: Happiness. Elation and satisfaction bloomed in my heart, so much so that I couldn't tell if I was happy to receive such great emotions or because they were donated. That's when I glimpsed at the inside of the box and realized, there was a note. It read, "I don't deserve these emotions. Take em'." It finally dawned on me, this was someone's *unwanted* happiness. What could've happened to a person to donate their happiness? Something terrible must've happened to their lives. I didn't know whether to smile or frown at this point for I was happy because someone else in the world was miserable. I wanted to feel bitter at this point, but I didn't know how to. So I sat there with my donated happiness, sending my best wishes to whoever is out there, struggling.
