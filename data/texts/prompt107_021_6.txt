*The demons came again, chasing down the newest Castknights, who had thought to escape the masssacre at Darvi.  A pike slammed through the chest of one of the knights, piercing through his runemail and splattering blood across the final three knights.*

*Two raced tot he gap in the stone, but they turned.  one of them yelled in a pale alto, "WE've got this!  Save the Princess!"  The knight pulled out two curved short swords from within their wasit-held scabbards, roared a challenge and dove into the chasing demons.*

*The sound went away for the final knight, stepping through the gateway into the meldeworld of the Dragons.  He staggered, and placed a hand on the wall, feeling his thoughts getting fuzzier.  He pushed on, knowing that he had to make sure the Prophecy of Steari could be fulfilled.  He slid slowly down the wall, as the most bbeautiful character he'd ever seen, or would see, appeared in front of him.*

*"You must take her.  The guides call to me, she is the last of the line of Uther.  Save her, and raise her as your own."*

*He died.  They died, bloodied, beaten, but unbroken.*

Tama woke up in a cold sweat.  Her lessons in guarding her mind and body had come along fantastically since her Knight, Ixilamur, began to train with her.  Stepping out of bed, her form whipcord-leanand tensed, she sat down in the Serpent position and began to meditate on the dream.  She passed through the exercises Ixilamur had passed on to her.  She sat, walking through the things she'd seen, seeing nothing of reality, but carefully processing like the ancient Mentar; human computers processing improbable amounts of data.

She felt, more than saw, Ixilamur approach, weapons in hand.    A spiked shield in his right hand, and a sural in his left hand.  He came on, with such silence that the uninitiated would have thought him invisible to all.

He struck a vicious twin strike, aiming to decapitate.  Tama ducked, unseeing of the weapons, and struck with a scything sweep of Ixilamur's legs.  She came out of her meditation with a snap, moving through Cutting Wheat to Strike the Heavens to Cat Diving on Bird to Heaven's Axe, remembering not to leave an opening.

*Good*, Ixilamur pulsed to Tama.  *You remembered not to leave an opening.*  He struck again, whipping the shield through a slicing angle, aiming to break ribs.  Tama switched to Drunken Weave, through Dangling the Line, sweeping the shield-arm with an inverted Cast the Nets, neatly breaking the arm.  

Ixilamur yelped,a pain searing through the arm, now dangling limply.  *Well done!*  Another pulse, tinged with pain and pride.  He unclasped the shield from his arm, dropping the sural in the process.

Tama grinned, a flash of teeth that clearly mimicked the dragon's grimace.  *Your training, Father.*  A pulse of affection followed, and she bowed.

"Let me heal that, Father."  She stood, and passed through Prancing Elk before opening a third headspace.  Within that headspace she prepared a casting of Mending Circle, picturing the symbols within her mind.  Placing her hands at each side of the joint, she spoke again out loud.  "I'm going to place it back in now, and it's going to hurt."

Holding both hands above and beloe the break, she cast, piscturing the warm blue of the spell around the break, medning bone and tissue.  Ixilamur Yelped, a very inhuman roar of pain.  She swatted him in a friendly manner, then pulsed a message. *You need to eat, Father.*  "Is it my turn to cook?" she spoke out loud.

He chuckled, a snorting with a hint of flame.  *Of course, Your Highness.*  Ixilamur disappeared in a puff of smoke, before returning to his much larger form.

"Oh, dear child, you are ready."  Ixilamur sighed, knowing that she would have to go out into the world, and soon.  

The Prophecy would be fulfilled, but at what cost?
