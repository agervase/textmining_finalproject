It sat in a crack between dimensions, waiting. With its long, winding tenctacles, the monster tried again to open the gateway that kept it trapped in its prison, and found that it could feel the rift bending. It laughed, the round, bulbous organs all over its body shaking, for it knew that it was only a matter of time before it could exact its revenge on humanity.

Spaghetti. The word that gave it power. Many years ago, after the monster had been imprisoned, the word was banished from all literature. Anyone that uttered "spaghetti" would be executed, their family forced to work as slaves. In time, the monster had been forgotten, and the word resurfaced as the name for something called 'pasta', which the humans used as fuel. Modern humanity had become obsessed with the dish, consuming copious amounts of it all over Earth, and using the forbidden word every time it was eaten. 

Whenever the humans mentioned spaghetti, the viscous red liquid that covered the monster's body would glow, and flecks of white substance would appear, allowing its tentacles to grow. It heard a voice on Earth order a "Spaghetti Bolognese", and it knew it was ready. A winding tentacle pierced through the rift, shattering the fragile restraints that had been placed there years before. As the monster prepared to exit its prison, it gazed down at its hulking mass.

"This is Channel 6 News, and I'm Kathy Burns. We have a report coming in from Florida, where a hurricane that seems to be made of spaghetti has appeared. At least twenty people have been confirmed dead, and hundreds have been injured. We will provide more updates soon. Now for a weather update. James?"

"Thanks Kathy. This is going to be the hottest weekend on record, with a high of 40 on Saturday and a high of 41 on Sunday. As for the weather? It looks like it's going to be cloudy... with a chance of meatballs."
