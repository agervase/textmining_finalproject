"It's just overdone."

"I swear, this one's going to be really good. Check this out so you're in this situation where you give out a expected punishment *but insteaaad-*"

"It's contrived."

"No dude, this one's totally original-"

"That's not the point."

"I think when you sit down and think about it you're going to like it."

"You're not hearing me-"

"Like what would happen, right? Like *what would happen* if like-"

"I don't care. You just use me as this stock character for evil or divine punishment-"

"But this one's going to be really cool."

"Then write it yourself holy fuck. Every day with this-"

An even larger, more abstract hand fell upon the devil's shoulder. The Devil hadn't even heard the stranger's approach. He had assumed he was alone with the redditor. The redditor was *always* alone.

"Who the fuck are you?"

"You can't stop him." Said the WP premise that would require and entire book or feature length film to flesh out.

"Fuck you, I can stop him. I'm the Devil."

"No, I mean you literally can't stop him. He just wants and he wants and he wants. He's a consumer. He doesn't care about you."

"GUYS OMG! What if the Devil like, had to do a bunch of backflips?!?!"

The WP premise that requires and entire book disappeared, faded like vapor into nothing. In it's place an asinine pun came chuckling into existence, honking it's nose and yucking like a maniac.

"I LOVE THIS GUY!"

"No dude this guy's the worst." Clones of the original pun trailed behind, becoming weaker. You could hear the sound of toilets flushing in the distance. 

"I don't think you're seeing the layers in the story. Like-"

"Like what?!?! Where is that story supposed to go???? What freedom does the writer have to make the story their own, something THEY want to write about?"

"Well I'm just thinking, like, what if the Devil got super sick right? What if doing all those backflips like, makes him have to vomm you know? Didn't see that coming."

"Then fucking write *that*! FUCK." The dancing puns vanished in a puff of smoke.

"I miss anything?" The voice came from a WP so narrowly constrained everyone already knows what's going to happen.

"Not really-"

"Whose this?"

"You guys have met a BUNCH of ti-"

"Anyway I was just pitching the devil here on this great new part I have for him. Basically he's going to do a ton of backflips-"

"Oh so he gets super sick and throws up everywhere?" Interrupted Narrowly Constrained WP.

"YEAH MAN. OMG we are so on the same page. So he's like throwing up and maybe it's like a golden fiddle situation . . ."

"Yeah I'm going to pass on this." With a quick fist bump Narrowly slunk out the window from which he came. 

Alone again, the Devil tried reasoning with him. "Just drop this man. Just stop it. Go outside, learn a language."

"PFFFTTT" the redditor snorted in that nasally way that was indistinguishable from his laughter. 

"Fine! How about trying to just write something of your own?"

"This story **is** my own."

"No, it's *NOT*. It's just a bunch of bullshit. It's just recycled pop-culture garbage. Even that fucking golden fiddle shit has been done a thousand times. Fucking Futurama did it."

"Futurama's a great show."

"And doing this is ripping them off! You're ripping off a good show!"

"I don't know, I just really like the devil."

"You *never* go to church."

"Church is boring."

"OF COURSE IT IS. This is boring! The devil is boring. I AM BORING. I'm boring because I mean nothing to you. You don't know me. You know nothing about me. You think you know red-skinned Italian man from fucking Loony Toons and Constantine."

"Constantine is soooooo good."

"No it's not!"

"Dude, Constantine's great. You wanna watch it."

"I can't talk to you when you get like this. You KNOW it's not. It's *not* a good movie."

A long silence passed between them. The redditor's eyes darting towards the one blu-ray he owned. Constantine. 

"I just . . ." The Devil was at a bit of a loss for what to say. "I just don't understand why you keep coming back to these same tired tropes when they mean nothing to you. Nothing! Why can't you just say something - *anything*. Something **REAL**. Something HONEST. Something that takes guts to say. Something only you can say because it comes from the heart. From inside yourself."

The redditor's eyes still had not left that blu-ray. 

"What's your truth. What is it that only you know? What's . . . What's-" A rage swept over the devil. The impetuousness. The talent-less gobbsmacking idiocy of the stupid wormy little cretin-

"**WHAT IS YOUR SOUL! RENDER IT UNTO FLESH THROUGH ME! I AM YOUR REDEEMER! I AM THE LORD OF DARKNESS YOUR GOD LUCIFER AND YOU WILL TELL ME YOUR WRITING PROMPT!**" The room filled with a terrible fire. 

The redditor began to type:

[WP] You and the Devil watch Constantine over and over and he thinks it's super cool.
