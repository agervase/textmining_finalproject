*Okay, logging in. 'Shattrath City'. Hmm where should we start... Character Profile... dual Warglaives, check. Close Character Profile. Open Main Bag. Hmm what is all of this green chatter over here...*

Orcage: HOOCHEE!!!

Inyoumom: About time you came back, noob

Owinfrey: Wow, our fearless gm has finally returned O.o

Inyoumom: Invite sent, noob

Inyourmom: Accept, noob

Inyourmom: ACCEPT NOOOB


*Click the 'Accept' button on the box that popped up in the middle of my screen. A bunch of new windows pop up, showing names, health bars, weird little icons above each section...*


Guild: **Hello fellow guildmates.**

Bariumenema: Summon inc

Inyourmom: Jump on vent noob


*Close Main Bag. Click 'Accept' on the new box as well. Ah, that's a cool loading screen. Sunwell Plateau. Sick, this is the last dungeon of the expansion!!! Hmm, now there's green AND blue text going on.*

/officer: Owinfrey: whatevers, you probably don't need vent anyways.


/officer: Owinfrey: just make sure to baby sit your gf Maria, in case adds end up on her

/officer: Orcage: lolol, you know that's a dude right?

/officer: Owinfrey: w/e, just get to the boss and buff up

/officer: Inyourmom: can you even read noob

/officer: **Yes I can read.**


*Everyone seems to be going in this direction, guess I'll just follow them. Here is the 'Maria' they were talking about. Inspect character. Interesting, a Paladin with spirit, wonder if things work different this late in the game. Right click + follow*


/raid: Owinfrey: Okay everyone, start buffing up. Y'all know this fight. We've been here for 3 months now, making progression kills, studying other server first videos, farming up what we need. Now pot up, nut up, and let's down this fucker.

/raid: Haruyo: I'm missing BoM

/raid: Bariumenema: kk, got it

/raid: Inyourmom: AI done, hey rogues, buff me

/raid: Orcage: Yeah buff me too

/raid: Haruyo: hurrr I'll buff your face


*There's so many more buttons that I'm used to. Backstab, nope. Vanish, nope. Cloak of Shadows, oops actually clicked that one instead of just hovering over it, nope.*


/raid: **I don't appear to have any buffs to give you**

/raid: Owinfrey: ...

/raid: Inyourmom: That's because rouges suck. l2mage

/raid: Owinfrey: anyways... kk ready check up and tanks can pull

/raid: Owinfrey: groups 1 and 2 on star, 3 and 4 on circle, ffs don't blow your bls until I call it and rotate you into the correct group


*Click the 'Ready' button. Staying next to Maria. Got my warglaives, this will be fun.*

*Orcage and Bariumenema are running in first, okay I guess they are the tanks. Maria is still standing back here. Everyone else is running in, looks like other rogues, warriors, a lion, and a wolf. Man this room is sick, all red and orange.*


/raid: Owinfrey: damage is light on the star, hunters switch deeps there

/w: Bariumenema: hey? afk? come hit this shit?


*Bariumenema is jumping up and down, I guess I should be over there attacking.*


/w: **OKAY I WILL START ATTACKING OVER THERE NOW.**

/w: **sorry caps lock**

/raid: Owinfrey: okay we're behind pace already, no pop or b rezs. just stay down, if we lose anyone important, just wrap up the wipe

/raid: Owinfrey: here come the adds, ranged swap over


*Oh, more mobs, I should attack them too since they're close. Right click mob. Swing swing swing, man these warglaives look sick. Pow, look at them explode when I hit them. Man I'm strong. Let's try some of these skills. I can't use Cloak of Shadows again yet. What does this button say, Tricks of the Trade? That sounds like it should do a lot of damage.*


/raid: Owinfrey: loose add


*Uh oh, looks like Maria died, see I should have stayed there to protect her, instead of listening to Bariumenema. I'll make sure to just stay close to her/him next time.*


/raid: Owinfrey: /facepalm

/raid: Owinfrey: wipe it up, get back in here, let's go again

/raid: Owinfrey: only 3 more hours until raids flip guys, lets get this down


*I can't believe I'm raiding SWP, epic. Click 'Release' button. Man, this was the best $200 I ever spent, this is going to be so much fun!!!*

First WP response ever, lol and actually haven't played WoW in 7 years now, but the prompt just brought up some nice memories (not of me, but of a friend that tried to buy a max level rogue instead of leveling one himself haha)
