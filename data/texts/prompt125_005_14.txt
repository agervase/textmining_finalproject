'This was taking a lot longer than the last time', God thought. 'I wonder what has happened, glad I loaded that "Time never stops" mod.'

God got up from his workstation and went to make himself a drink. Coming back he noticed the holographic interface full of strange geometric shapes amidst the variety of nature. “What strange creatures have evolved since last time I loaded up?” He said to himself, “What’s happened to the beasts I nurtured before.” 

As God scrolled around the world he noticed the occasional flying creature, apparently made of metal, whizz by at incredible altitudes for living beings.

“What a strange world has evolved here. I’m going to take a closer look.” God parted his palms and felt that slight disorientation of rushing towards the ground at hundreds of miles per hour, without the sensation accompanying it, that came with this program. After a split-second God had oriented himself. The first time he had done that he had fallen over backwards and to his surprise he saw a being that looked like himself, performing an almost identical movement with his palms. This being did fall over however, and God chuckled. “NOOB” he thought.

Then it dawned on him. THESE were the creatures of the world, not the Geometric shapes, not the metal flying creatures. Everything was still flesh, just not his giant scaled beasts anymore. The man he saw fall over stood up, then pulled a part of his head off! No, wait, that was just some technology. “They have advanced tools!” he thought.

God quickly scanned the logs of the file and to his dssapointment saw that his ‘Dinosaurs’ as the modern creatures called them were completely wiped out. Sure a couple of the lesser versions had survived through whatever had happened to them alligators and the like. And tiny dinosaurs still existed - Lizards apparently. But no big old monsters. God frowned, “hmm” he thought. “I think it’s time to fix that…”

God located an old creature file he had previously made ready to use against another if he ever decided to go multiplayer on this world, always a danger as that makes every change permanent. 

“Now where should i try this guy out. If i remember correctly he was huuuge.” God pulled up the console:
