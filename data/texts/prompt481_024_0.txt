I sat in silence. There were more of them again. Their eyes staring at me from the walls, the desecrated canvas they lived in. 
I felt sick seeing this in front of me. Is this my unconscious mind? Maybe it’s just what my deepest darkest thoughts look like? Or am I…am I doing this?
 Whenever I wake up I’m always immaculately clean; it’s a lot more scary than if I were filthy. I had always wished I could see myself just one day, what I do when I’m out, but I haven’t wished that in a long time.

At first I didn’t mind the gradual descent of these pictures into…well more towards the what they have become. Their value went up, it was art right, no one else seemed to mind so it must be alright. But now, hell I can’t even bear to see them. I have dreams of them you know, when I’m out, such awful dreams. I feel these godawful feelings, steel against bone, rage, pain, just such pure fucking hatred and glee. I don’t want to read the papers anymore...Kids keep disappearing. When I’m out I can’t see it but I told myself maybe I’m just tapping into someone else, maybe it isn’t me, but then I started to recognise the kids in the pictures, what had been done to them.  That’s when I stopped reading the papers. 

I had depicted…things, things that the papers never said; that I couldn’t know. That I shouldn’t know. I looked at the room around me, I blacked out almost every day now, and more and more kept appearing. There were over thirty. There was only one thing I could do to stop it all.

The noose was tighter than you’d think; it cut into my skin as the chair wobbled under my feet. At least I could do one goddamn good thing for once in my life. Goodbye mum, bye dad, bye Sarah, I’ll let you know how hell is. As I kicked the chair the rope crushed at my neck, I took my last breath as I felt my legs flailing wildly and darkness descended.

Then I woke up.
