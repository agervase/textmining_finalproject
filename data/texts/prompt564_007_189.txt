A switch left unflipped. A simple mistake, easily overlooked, condemning me to 500 years my own icy prison.

Pain, a childish, involuntary response long forgotten in a society where anything can be remedied with a single red and white pill. The type of pain no human had ever experienced for millennia. A constant, freezing pain that would never put me to sleep; that wasn’t how I designed it.

The stages of grief manifested themselves in the hallucinations.

First I could hear them coming to take me out. Conversations about how to open the machine safely, the locks coming undone, the room pressurizing, all as real as flesh and blood. I could see them just outside the window, I screamed and screamed, but I couldn’t open my mouth. I could feel the warmth of the room, the pain began to subside, but never stopped.

A hundred years later, the hums of the machines turned into furious roars of white noise. I tried constantly kicking at the glass and ice, yelling so loud I could almost remember the sound of my own voice. I kept telling myself that if I just kept trying, one day I’d be able to move. The paralysis wouldn’t last forever.

For 100 years more I’d beg, please, take me out of this. Please, let me die. I’d began to forget what people looked like, what language sounded like. The people I pleaded to outside the window became more and more alien, my prayers sounding more and more like the white noise of the generator.

Then one day, there was silence. No more screaming, no more begging. No more shapeless voices outside the freezer. Just pain. The pain was the only thing left I could trust, the only real thing I’d experienced for the past 300 years. I welcomed it, thanked it for keeping me company every day for 72,999 days more. 

Until the last day. The day they woke me up, the 500th anniversary of the day I died.
