"Mr. President?"

The room was silent afterwards. And I could not blame them for the looks they where all shooting at me. When you become the most successful POTUS by reducing the National Debt to nothing, striking peace deals between long warring Middle Eastern factions, and setting the country up to become the world's first Carbon Neutral government; why in the hell would you invade Russia?

"I know that most of you think that an attack on Russia is out of the question, but you must know that I would not suggest such action unless it was absolutely necessary. Not a single one of our former enemies stand against us except for one nation. ISIS has been erased thanks to the help of our European and Asian allies, Korea is a fully unified front thanks to the efforts of our military, and even the nations that once harbored strong feelings of anti-American sentiment dwindle on a day to day basis due to our actions of reasoning and understanding. The only place to dare challenge the authority of the New Free Order is Russia. Talk has dried up, any efforts of our allies to aide them is met with armed resistance, and frankly I find it all a bit much when they refuse to acknowledge our peace to be one of mutual benefit and us relenting to their demands. If history had taught us anything, they are the one nation to stand between total Utopia and a continuation of status-quo bickering of olden days. It is my opinion that our efforts focus on stamping out the last of our hold outs in order to begin anew."

"But Mr. President. How could you, of all people, forget that not one single person in history has been able to take Russia?"

"Do not worry about that. One thing about mistakes is that you can learn from them. I plan on doing just that. How is our climate change satellite coming along?"

"It should be ready in two weeks. We will be able to inhabit Antarctica in no time."

"Good. Then we begin by testing it out in Siberia and begin our campaign."
