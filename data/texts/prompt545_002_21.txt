Count Druettus barges through the golden gates, with a scroll in hand, and a neck in his other hand. It was Peasant Perez's neck, whom was carrying a message from the great King Swale.  
   
"My gracious King! This peasant claims to be a messenger of our sworn enemy! He reckons it's a peace offering!"  
  
King Huguard of Adelidith arises from his throne, adjusts his robe and crown, and gently speaks "Read it."  
  
Count Dreuttus turns Perez's body towards him, shoves the scroll into his chest, and then pushes him forward towards the bottom of the throne's staircase and yells "Read it peasant!"   
  
Trembling, knees on the ground, and head to floor, Perez opens the scroll and starts to mutter the words.  
  
"M...M..My dear-"  
  
"Louder!" - Screams the Count  
  
"My dear Huguard, our differences have gone on for far too long. 
Perhaps it is time to look at our similarities instead, and focus on strengthening them.  
Our resources, and our geographic locations put us at a great advantage against our far neighbours. 
Together, we can prosper. I ask to conjoin our kingdoms. 
If the peasant returns to me aliv-"  

Perez pauses briefly, starts to turn his head towards the count, but then is immediately knocked back  
  
"Keep reading!" - The count insists.  
  
"Alive, then I will take it that you have accepted the offer. If not, then our cold war continues. If I receive his head however, then we shall go to war within the dawn, I await your response." 
  
Terrified, Perez keeps his eyes locked to the ground as he slowly folds the scroll. 

Before allowing the King to make a decision, Count Druettus interrupts, and suggests to escalate this message into the situation room to further discuss the options. 

King Huguard agrees to meet after midday. 
  
Dreuttus grabs the peasant by the neck again, and escorts him outside the palace. 

Once they are alone, Perez turns to Dreuttus and frustratingly cries "Really? My head? My life? Why would you add that I tho-"  
  
"Relax. The executioner obeys my command. This escalates the seriousness of the offer, of whom the king might agree to. Go back to Bromokath, and await further instructions. I will be in contact with Count Rolin to organise."   
  
"Alright. When do we initiate our turn?"  
"We would need a peasant from Adelidith no more than two dawns from today if we are to successfully pull this off."  
  
"I will call upon my friend Walkelinus of Bromokath to meet with Count Rolin"    
"Alright, and I'll let Rolin draft a similar message immediately upon the conclusion of the situation room."

*It is said that the great kings of Adelidith and Bromokath hold the keys to the greatest treasures of the Lothoinnorian region. Only the kings can possess said keys and location, and the secrecy would go to their graves upon their death.*  
  
*The great people of Adelidith and Bromokath have grown frustrated with their kings' personal dispute with each other, and yet are unable to rise against their kings because they are of great value to their kingdoms, as individually, each king is kind and giving to the people, in addition to them holding the keys.*   
  
*The people of both kingdoms were divided into two factions, those who wanted to conjoin the kingdoms, and those who wanted to stay split.*   
  
*Both factions had questionable motives.*

King Swale arises from his golden bed, indulges in his daily great breakfast, and starts to prepare for his day.   
  
He proceeds to his throne, his subordinates stand still with fear and respect, eyes locked into the opposite walls.  

King Swale adjusts his robe, and sits on the glorious throne.  
  
Count Rolin barges through the golden gates, with a scroll in hand, and a neck in his other hand. It was Peasant Walkelinus's neck, whom was carrying a message from the great King Huguard.  
  
"My gracious King! This peasant claims to be a messenger of our sworn enemy! He reckons it's a peace offering!"  
  
King Swale of Bromokath calmly replies "Well, let him read it then will you?"  
  
Walkelinus stands straight, opens the scroll, and starts reading.  
  
"My dear Swale, our differences have gone on for far too long. 
Perhaps it is time to look at our similarities instead, and focus on strengthening them.  
Our resources, and our geographic locations put us at a great advantage against our far neighbours. 
Together, we can prosper. I ask to conjoin our kingdoms.  
As a token of good will, I have asked my greatest sculptor to create a statue for you. Inside it is a gift."  

Walkelinus looked puzzled at that bit, and as he turns around, a large figure on a platform starts to reel into the gates with the assistance of a few men.
  
It was a large stone statue of King Swale, crafted to the the most incredible detail.  

King Swale rises from this throne, goes to the statue, and seems to be impressed.  
Curious, Swale grabs his magnificent sword, and vigorously slices through the statue. 
  
The top half of the status falls apart, shatters open, and reveals a severed head.  

Walkelinus is appalled with horror, as he sees his great friend Perez's head with his eyes open on the floor.  
   
Walkelinus looks at Rolin, and Rolin grins back.  
  
"It is war then! We go at dawn! Prepare!" - Yells the king.  
  
Walkelinus's throat is then slit on the spot, as he falls to the ground and bleeds to death.  
  
The scandal has spread throughout the entire region, as it was known that the Counts have conspired to overthrow the other. The people felt betrayed as they had their utmost trust in the counts to fix the relations, and have realised that those whom they were friends with, were no more. It was a war for the thrones. The rebels stayed home, while the loyalists went to war. 
  
The war lasted several days on the field, and have wreaked havoc upon both kingdoms. Thousands of lives were lost.  
Upon the grounds of destruction, King Swale rides to the empty vast land that circles Adelidith and Bromokath where the great war fell place, and along him was Count Rolin.   
  
King Huguard and Count Dreuttus ride towards the same land, to meet their sworn enemies as well.  

It was a bright sunny day, with a chilly wind blowing.  
  
They meet on land, lock eyes, and then start laughing hysterically.  
  
"Good job gentlemen!" - Shouts Swale  
  
"Fantastic job indeed. We have taken out all the so called loyalists. How foolish of them to think we wouldn't know" - Replies Huguard  

Rolin and Dreuttus nod in response.  

"Shall we go and build the new kingdom afresh now?" - Says Rolin  
  
"Let us begin." - Responds Dreuttus 

The four men ride into the horizon, hoping to build a better kingdom for the remainder of their people, the 'rebels'.
