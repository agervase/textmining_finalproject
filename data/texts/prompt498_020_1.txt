They say that 10,000 is the magic number. The founder of Oracle and creator of Java programmed 10,000 hours and gained the ability of super coding. Usain Bolt ran 10,000 km and now he has super speed, which is unimaginable considering his previous records. In any case, these are pretty cool things to do, but I wondered what would happen if you did 10,000 of some stupid task, like put on a hat or drink alcohol. Drinking alcohol seemed like a pretty fun idea, so I went out and bought as much as I could carry and started drinking. Over time, I became a veteran in finding ways to drink, because even drinking can get mundane when doing it every day. Luckily, GoFundMe helped me out with the costs a bit, I guess a lot of people want to see what happens, since everyone else going for the 10,000 powers usually did something cool.  I even started a stream at around liter #386, and got quite a few viewers in the following months, although there was a lot of dropping off over time.

It was the final day. The final liter. A huge audience had gathered to watch the momentous occasion, there were even a couple of news outlets around to see what kind of powers I would gain from something so stupid. I lifted up the bottle and began chugging. At this point, a liter was no problem. As the bottled emptied, more and more, the crowd began to cheer harder and harder. Finally, the last drop traveled down my throat, and I instantly fell over. Everyone gasped. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't see straight, I couldn't stand, and I really had to pee. I just lay there, trying to gather my senses, when I see a blurry shape and hear the voice of my friend Bob. "Dude, I think you're just super drunk."
