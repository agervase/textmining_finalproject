  **There it was**, Martha thought as her eyes squinted at Charlie’s crimson lips. They moved so fast, and barely parted from each other as she made the most irritating humming sound every time she stopped a sentence. Her ECO controllers were most likely malfunctioning. The language translating technology used two very small and thin circular film strips, like RFID tags, that the wearer would place behind each ear. They had been malfunctioning ever since Martha started learning Charlie’s language in secret, after the proposal. She found it fascinating, she knew she was good at picking up different coding languages with ease, but learning Charlie's language had taken her half a year.

**Charlie would see it** as an act of love, Martha thought, as Charlie was the romantic one out of the pair. It made Martha excited, as she kept her hands working on the laptop across from Charlie. They were going to get married in two weeks at Charlie’s family villa, both parents were diplomats stationed in the California territory after the war for resources united several countries. The family had powerful ties in politics and the private renewable energy sector, which lead to their fateful meeting over a year ago. Charlie had been the key to keeping Martha sane while deadlines passed for one of the most ambitious flight programs the aerospace industry had ever seen.

**Martha smiled** and her cheeks flushed as she remembered the third time they met and how their lips pressed together after having a few too many drinks. Charlie was a Project Manager in the Procurement department, after a change in carriers landed her in the Pacific bracket of the project. Oh man, she was gorgeous and sharp, with her bouncy red hair and wicked smile. The night they went out for drinks with colleagues was the night Martha fell head over heels. Charlie’s black dress hugged her in all the right places and her voice hit all the right notes while her sharp tongue brought tears of joy and laughter to everyone around her. It’s how she got Martha, her humor, to agree to de-stress and hang out with the team instead of working another night without sleep. Charlie became her other half, they complimented each other so well, a team to reckon with in the project and out of it.

**A loud thump** made her snap out of it, Charlie kept talking to the wedding planner, her words muffled here and there as the now empty glass slammed on the wooden table. Martha had agreed to let Charlie take care of all the wedding arrangements, to keep her focus on her team's deadline. This was one of those calls.

**Peeling off** the right ECO strip, Martha listened to Charlie, her voice was velvet in her ears. But the notes didn’t match the words, “ What do you mean I have to ….” Charlie turned her head and blew a kiss to Martha, “...I can’t bare her touching me any longer.”

**Suddenly the heart** that beat inside Martha’s chest stopped. Martha’s health monitoring system flashed in red before her eyes, a hologram. It was something each team member wore to monitor their health in this high paced and very sensitive project. Wouldn’t want irreplaceable workers killing over because they were overworked, now would we? 

**Charlie stopped talking** abruptly, removing the phone from her ear. Martha sucked in air, one breath, deep and agonizing as she quickly recovered. Her hand went up to her right ear, brushing long thick black hair away from her face while slipping the ECO back, but out of place.

**“Honey? What’s wrong?”** Charlie rushed over to Martha, voice cooing as she placed a hand on her mates shoulder, her green hazel eyes darting to the computer screen showing code Charlie would never understand. 

**“It’s all wrong…”** Martha’s eyes began to tear, softly shaking her head while her hands began to tremble. Each key was pressed slowly and deliberately into the environment that was up on the screen. It was a fail safe code, part of a Fault-tolerant environment she helped set up in case of emergencies. There was protocol that was ingrained to very few key individuals with specific pieces of the project. During the war, and even before that, espionage was common like Apple Pie was in the former States. It brought down countries and killed technological and scientific progress at an alarming rate. When this project began, 17 years ago, the threat was real and so the project brought in a third company that tended to work outside of a governing body for the sake of man kind's future. Martha herself had taken over a role she was not meant to have at such an early time in her career, as her predecessor had disappeared from the territory completely and is believed to be either dead or compromised. 

**The first step** for Martha’s specific role was to turn on the Fault-tolerant environment with the specific code she had just entered, and step two was pure audio that would be picked up by the system. Depending on the auditory signal, spoken words or an insignificant sound like that of a certain keystroke, the environment would operate accordingly. Martha knew, in her heart, all the signals she had missed...wanted to miss, after her ECO controllers begin to lose function. She had blinded herself, and Charlie had let a crack open on her well positioned mask. Had Charlie become too confident? Maybe Martha was wrong? Could it have been a mistake, maybe she mistranslated?

**Martha pushed** her emotional vulnerabilities aside and focused on her analytical skills. Those never failed her.

**Everything began** to make sense to Martha. All the small signals in Charlie’s body language, odd enthusiastic behavior on code she could not understand. And her family ties of power, and the lack of twinkle in her eyes when they made love. How could she be such a fool? 

**“TCP is corrupt and…”** Martha swallowed hard adjusting her tone, “ I’ll have to go into the office.” A few specific keywords, in any combination, completed step two of protocol. Martha was a target, and her work would most likely be the goal. Her position was logged and work encrypted.

**“All this for a…” **Charlie purred what would seem words of encouragement. Martha felt Charlie's red locks hitting the back of her neck as Charlie paused and leaned on her body, “I’m sure you can’t muck it up anymore than your attempt at keeping any stable relationship.”

**Charlie kissed** the top of Martha’s head and pushed the cell phone back to her ear. “Just a small hiccup,” she said while stroking Martha’s hair and letting her fingers travel down her neckline, “I’ll be a widow in two weeks after the honeymoon.”

**Martha hit the** sleep option of the laptop, and sealed the deal, her jaw set, straining as Charlie pushed away from her to pace back into the conversation on the other side of the table, “*Of course I’m not stupid, two weeks is too early and we need her.*” 

**Closing her laptop**, Martha gathered her briefcase and card keys from the counter. Counting each step she took, and each heart beat that pumped blood through her veins. Step three would be completed when Martha reaches the office. All communications and movement to and from Charlie for the last ten years would be analyzed, no matter how secure they were. By the time Martha opens her office door, an envelope detailing the tragic accident and emergency steps to take would be waiting for her.

**“*Honey?*” Charlie called out** as Martha reached the front door, “*I love you.*” Martha smiled briefly towards Charlie as she took the final step outside their apartment and closed the door behind her.
