I whistled as I walked down the dirt road. It was getting dark, and I just put the old factory behind me for my last shift. It just sucks my car's in the shop and I have to walk home. 

I wasn't too worried about my own safety, though. We didn't have a problem back in town with any crazies in the woods or even any wild animals. Most dangerous thing you're bound to run into out here is a fox, and they won't be too difficult to fend off in the off chance they try to get hostile with me. 

As my eyes scanned the road ahead of me, I idly fiddled with my pocket knife, pulling the blade out, and clicking it back in, then back out, then back in. There was a rhythm to my mindless fiddling, which took the place of music when I had no data to listen to it off of Spotify. Just ran over my limit for the month. 

Then my phone vibrated. It wasn't a text, because the vibration pattern was different. It wasn't a vibration I was used to. Three short vibrations for a text, one longer one for everything else. This was several longer ones back to back, like someone was calling me. I pulled it out as quickly as I could to see what the hell was wrong with my phone, when I read the words. 

"THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. BARRICADE ALL ENTRIES TO YOUR HOUSE. DO NOT GO OUT AFTER SUNDOWN. RESTRICT CONTACT WITH ANY OTHER PERSONS. DO NOT ENTER ANY TUNNELS OR DARKENED PLACES DURING THE DAYTIME. DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE OR GIVE OFF ANY LIGHT BETWEEN 6PM AND 8AM. STAY INSIDE YOUR HOMES UNTIL DAWN. MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT AID IS UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. LISTEN FOR MORNING REPORTS GIVEN BY YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY BROADCAST NETWORK AT 9AM. GOOD LUCK."

What. The. Fuck. 

I stopped in my tracks and looked around, my heart already racing. What the hell kind of emergency broadcast was this? I scanned the tree line for anything at all, but my eyes landed on nothing other than unmoving grass, broken branches, and fallen logs. 

I let out a huge sigh of anxiety and fear as I unlock my phone, and click over to Google Maps. I open it up to my current location, which is roughly 5km from the factory and 5km from town. The people at the factory working the night shift are going to have no clue at all that this is happening. The service is terrible out there to begin with, but within those brick walls good luck of getting anything at all. There's no TVs or radios there either, and the secretary- the only person connected to the internet through her desktop- went home early at 3pm. 

My eyes darted up to the top of my screen to see the time. 5:30pm. Shit. 

If I head back to town, I could get home, follow the instructions and just hope for the best, but I could be leaving all my friends to whatever the hell this might all be about. 

If I head back to the factory I could warn them about it all, but then we'd all will probably be in a lot of danger. There's a lot of machines in there that you can't just shut off on a whim. They take time to shut off, and in the meantime they're loud as all hell. Plus you can't really board up the windows of the factory, since they're so big and high up, and we definitely don't have enough to cover them up. 

God help me. What am I supposed to do? Do I just head home and save my own skin, or do I go back to the factory to warn everyone?




I don't know why I ended up making this a possible CYOA but I did and would have no problem continuing it if anyone had any interest.
