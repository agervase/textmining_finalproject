"Please kill me finally," croaked from my lips as the blood flowed from my body.

**NO.** A single word reverberated through my mind, not heard but a thought from without.

I attempt to plead more, but my consciousness fades. After all, Death only appears right at the last moment life, ready to release the soul to the afterlife, or in my case, to prevent it.

I open my eyes, staring up at the white stucco ceiling, fluorescent lights flooding my hospital room with an unnatural light. The beeping of monitors next to be breaking reaching my ears, how my caretakers failed to know how little they were needed. Blinking the last my my exhaustion from my eyes I realise I'm strapped down to the bed unable to move. I look around the room and see the two policeman and a nurse standing nearby. My undying heart skips a beat in recognition, it was Matthew! But then reality kicks in and the sadness begins. Matthew is 2 thousand years dead, this is just yet another person who looks like him.

The officers finally notice I'm awake and read me my rights. The nurse gets the doctor who then explains how it was a miracle that I was still alive. Their words wash over me, like the background noise of a broken record, I've heard them all a thousand times . I close my eyes, in an attempt to shut it all out.

At first I thought immortality was a blessing. Why would anyone ever want to die, right? It just sounds so amazing, and it would be if I wasn't human. Our minds hadn't evolved to deal with the incredible length of time that comes with immortality. It cracks at the edges until it all falls in. Death might have stopped my from dying, but my sanity left a long time ago.

Of course the first couple of centuries were enjoyable. I traveled the world, on my feet or on the back of a donkey cart, it didn't matter. I would get there eventually. I even starved to death many more times than I could count, He would appear and smirk at me, then leave me alive and able to travel again. I couldn't tell why he found it so amusing, at least not yet.

Then I met Matthew. A brother of the heart more than any other. When we me tit was an instant connection. We did everything together. He joined me on the travels around the world and taught me the meaning of caring for another. I couldn't just be blase about life any more, as he could actually perish. But Death has a wicked sense of humour, and on the time I died with Matthew by my side he looked at me with a wicked grin. I knew dread at that moment, what would he do to Matthew. I knew I had to keep him safe, and also myself. But Death never came for Matthew, for all of my fears. He lived a long and happy life, even got married to a beautiful woman and had 3 beautiful kids.

And that's when Death returned. One of Matthew's children got very sick, and hovered at the line between life and death. There's nothing I could do. I knew nothing about medicine or health at this point and my immortality helped me none. I had to watch my best friend go through the worst moment of his life and all I could do is watch. I did what I could to help, providing food and resources as required, but it didn't ever feel like it was enough. Months passed like this, but it felt like centuries. I was so relieved when the child finally recovered, waking up one morning full of life and happiness, Matthew was ecstatic. But as I said, Death has a wicked sense of humour, and this was the point where the child's body had finally given up fighting and had succumbed to what I later learned was called Cancer. She was bright and happy for one last day, then perished in the night. Matthew's sorrow was bottomless. He pushed me away as I tried to console him, locked me out of his house. "I just have to be alone with my family." for a while he said, the words searing into my heart beyond any physical pain I had felt. I wept for him and his family, but there was nothing I could do. So I went to meet Death.

&#x200B;

"Why?" I asked, my near-lifeless body lying in the dirt. My fading eyes looking up at Death.

**BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEARN**

And then I died.

&#x200B;

Eventually Matthew came out of his misery, but he was never the same again. He never laughed as deep, or as long as he used to. He was more protective, more guarded. We were still very close friends, but I knew that I came second to his family, and I still hold a little sorrow that there were parts of him that he kept to his family. The years stretched out into decades, and the true nature of the curse revealed itself. Matthew was getting old but I was not. He was losing his vitality, but I kept mine. Injuries and disease failed to mar my body, but not Matthew's. 

It didn't feel long until Matthew, grey-haired and wrinkle-skinned, asked me the question, 'Why don't you age?" 

He was my best friend, I had to tell him the truth, "Because ... Death won't let me." 

I misunderstood the tears welling in his eyes until he finally said, "So, you could have saved my boy? You didn't have to let him die?"

"No! I don't have that power, it's just me that can't die!" I tried to explain, but he had already turned away, the deep sorrow that had long lived in his heart was unfortunately renewed. I didn't know until then just how deep his sorrow truly was.

"Just go, please," he quietly pleaded and without another word I left.

&#x200B;

Death appeared that night, as I lay sleepless in my bed. His regular smirk missing, replaced with an expression of concern. I sit up in bed, confused, and look at him.

**I AM TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT I HAVE TO DO. YOU WILL LEARN ONE DAY.**

"Wait, what do you mean?!!" I shouted after him as he faded, and I realised that if I wasn't dying he was here for someone else.

I broke from my house and raced to Matthew's. The door was locked tight, but I could hear the sobbing coming from his wife and children within. And without needing to see, I knew he was gone. I wanted to see his body one last time, but I knew it would break me. I packed up all of my belongings, and left.

&#x200B;

It's been 2 thousand years, and the sorrow still lives deep in my heart. I've never tried to find another Matthew, for even though loneliness is a long and horrible curse, I'm not sure my psyche would survive it. Instead I live a lonely life, one that also threatens to send me mad. Man was never meant to be alone, our minds just can't handle the emptiness.
