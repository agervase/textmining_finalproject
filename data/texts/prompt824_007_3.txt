Floating, surrounded by puffy clouds made off cotton candy, and her body loosely covered by the changing scenery of chirping birds, blinding sun-rays and cloudy candy. Her brown oak hairs, opening a reveling glade of the face I ached for. Drifting in the weightlessness of the groundless heaven I encountered myself in, I got closer, and closer, at a fingers grace distance, and she looking at me with inciting eyes, suddenly a shadow, turning dark the skin on her face and on my arms, getting larger by the second. 

I looked up, the shape of a falling piano, then the anxiousness arousing of the sweet&sour dream, and suddenly, my he'd banged against something real. 

I woke up from hitting the ceiling with my head, I searched for my phone in my room cluttered by my floating stuff, I reached for the rope tied to the floor, just in case something like this would happen, and pulled my self to the ground. Floating through the hall way all the way to the kitchen, where mother tried to cook floating eggs. 
"Mom, what happened, I thought you paid the bills."
"Sorry son, is just they changed the price of the service we had..."
"So when are we having gravity back, you know how my gut gets when there is no gravity..."
"I could only afford the base package, so that we could breathe and eat, I don't want for us to go through another month of breathless undying, or not having a body..."

The tears swelling a lake around her eyes, cut me of my anger towards Universe inc. and their ludicrous lite packages, at least we could taste and see stuff, unlike some of the most unfortunate, at least our insurance covered the cost of our existence, but being a slave of your body, of your world, really made me want to blow up the universe.
