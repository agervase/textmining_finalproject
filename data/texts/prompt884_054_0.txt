I awoke to a shadowy room, a figure sitting in the back right corner. Studying me. Watching, waiting. 

“Wh-Where the fuck am I? What’s fucking going on?!”

The figure stands, a mountainous and hulking figure, nearly as wide as it was tall. 

The lighting here was poor, but there was a scented candle next to the chair I was adeptly restrained to. The knots were tight, and had no chance of loosening. I smelled cinnamon apple, strange. 

There was a small rectangular window at the top of the room to my left, moonlight struggling to reach inside. Maybe I was in a basement? Where was I before this? Before I woke up? 

The bar! That was it, I was with Chelsea and Jasmine, we went out for some drinks and to try to pick up some guys, god we can be such sluts but college is college, it’s all harmless fun. Where were they? I wonder if they are okay, everything seems so foggy, like trying to remember a distant dream.

As I scanned the room for anything of use, trying to understand my location, I noticed something; A used hot pocket crisper, and a bag of chips of some sort next to a computer. The logo of the chips was barely visible, as my eyes strained to see it I noticed what it read: Doritos.

The figure approached me, and as it got closer I noticed it’s strange head shape. Once within reach of the quiet flickering of the candlelight, I could see who it was. 

My memories were flooding back to me with every passing second. The man looked familiar but who was he??? He was wearing a fedora and had a thick scruffy beard, but only below the jawline. A truly repulsive sight, this guy must notice the irony in his attire, right?

As he approaches, breathing heavily and breath smelling sickly sweet, (like Mountain Dew? What the fuck?!) he lifted his right hand. I winced in anticipation and fear. He grabs the tip of his fedora and says one word:

“M’Lady”
