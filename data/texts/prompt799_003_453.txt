Reed had done his research, planned carefully for when the day came that his Avatar would visit him again.   


"Come your 18th Year, I will return to grant you a power chosen by you. This power will give you the means to unfold your mark upon this world and beyond, in mysterious ways. The 18th Year, the 3rd Month, the 22nd Day, I will find you and the contract will be bound. Be ready for that day, Young Reed."

&#x200B;

That was the message that 5-year old Reed was left with, after just having a party filled with balloons, cheap bowling-alley pizza and tooth-achingly sweet grocery store birthday cake. In the car on the way home, his mother had asked him if he had met his Avatar yet and he only nodded quietly, lost in his Avatar's powerful warning. 

&#x200B;

Any normal 5-year old would have probably began wishing for the standard packages. Super strength, speed, invulnerability, time-manipulation, the list went on. But, at the same time, looking at his parents, Reed realized something about the powers people came to obtain. 

&#x200B;

They had a limitation. On TV, animated characters had these powers that scaled to the skies and beyond, but in reality, people's powers did have a barrier that seemed insurmountable. No matter how hard you tried, you always hit it in the end. 

&#x200B;

So, determined to try and circumvent this, he instead turned to research and theory. It was all surprisingly dry at first, just pages and pages of text that he had to pour over and filter, but as the years passed, it became easier and easier. He learned the sciences in his spare time, steadfast in the belief that the key to passing this invisible barrier, lay somewhere in the depths of science and comprehension of universal forces. 

&#x200B;

It was on his 17th birthday, that he finally had his answer. Sleepless weeks and months had passed in a flash as he tried to make sure he had his request formulated perfectly, both in wording and understanding. No mistakes. His schoolmates, when asking about it, laughed when he tried to explain his desired power, ignorant of the how vast the potential of a simple concept could be. So many tried to convince him even, to change his wish or to ask for something basic, like telekinesis or time manipulation. Not surprising. That was how shallow their understanding was, plain and simple.

&#x200B;

Come his 18th birthday, Reed went to the outlook on the other side of town and waited for his Avatar to arrive. She was there in moments, her sharp, icy eyes staring straight at him, not through him like when he was 5. She had gained some newfound respect for him over the years. She'd watched him the entire time, he was sure of it now.   


There were no pleasantries exchanged. Both of them knew what they were there for and with no hesitation, Reed made his wish. 

His Avatar's eyes widened with excitement and where her palms touched his, there was a fiery glow, searing a mark into the palm of his hand to bind the contract she had waited 13 years to forge, perhaps longer, given her aura of wisdom and experience. Without a word, she left him standing there on the cliff side and though there was nothing said, nor any expression visible on her mostly featureless face, it was the first time he had ever gleaned the feeling of a smile from her. But, as she faded away, he immediately set about his demonstration preparation. He'd grown a little bit irritated about the constant pressing from others to select 'this power' or 'that power' because they were 'cool' or 'practical'. He had a bigger vision than that. He wanted to pass the limitations of others and set himself apart from all the rest. 

&#x200B;

So that day, he walked into the classroom cool as a cucumber and the time came, finally, for the students to demonstrate their chosen powers for the Choosing. Some lifted steel girders or flew around the school at near supersonic speeds, others vanished and reappeared and then there were some with somewhat 'niche' powers, like transforming into animals or altering gravity orientation.

&#x200B;

When it came time for Reed to go up, there was a small murmur and a few sparse chuckles. Someone even called out "Hey Reed, just don't go Nagasaki on us!", clearly in jest of his "Atomic Control" wish he'd mentioned. 

&#x200B;

Reed took a deep breath and loosened up, remembering what he'd practiced on the cliff side. His thoughts reverberated around inside his head. *Show them what it your wish really means. This is the power to top all others.*

&#x200B;

Without skipping a beat, Reed snapped his fingers. The walls of the school melted away into nothingness, garnering gasps from the crowd.   


Which turned to screams, as suddenly, the world went dark, as the sun in the sky, vanished into nothingness.
