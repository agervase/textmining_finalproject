How long has it been? How long has it been, I don't remember anything anymore. Where, where am I? Who, Who am I? How am I still here? Who still remembers me? How can anyone still remember me, when even I've forgotten who I am. I don't belong here. I'm dead, I've been dead for as long as I can remember. But I don't remember, so for all I know this was always like this. I'm surrounded by millions, millions of departed souls still here. I can't speak to them, nor can I really see them. They all seem like shadowy splotches to me. Most of them are loud, screaming, panicking. But after a few minutes or years.. or decades.. or something. They all quiet down and they stand around staring blankly at nothing. Some, some after a while disappear. Some quicker than others, and some take a bit more time. But none, none of them stay as long as I have. 

I sometimes think I remember my name, I think it was John. It was John, the accompanying pain makes me feel like it was. I think I had a wife, yes, no. I don't know. Alice is a name that feels right, must be because the pain is stronger now. I remember, Roads, I shouldn't have been driving. I didn't see it in time. Funny, what is time, I don't know what time is, I've been here for as long as I can remember.. but I don't re.. I remember. I couldn't stop, I should've stopped. why didn't I stopped? I'm hurting so bad now. I can't stand this pain, it's too much. How could I have forgotten? It was raining, I wasn't paying attention. "Honey, look out!" Alice screamed, Stop please I.. I remember. Why am I remembering this? any of this? I don't know why I'm still here, Who still remembers me? I.. think, I think I remember who I am.. I was.  I can't, I can't, this pain ah! Make it stop! make it stop! I don't want to remember! Someone please, stop the hurting! I.. 

Um, I.. How.. How long has it been? Who, Who am I? Where am I? I don't remember anything anymore. How am I still here? I'm dead, I've been dead for as long as I can remember. But I don't remember, so for all I know this was always like this. Yes, it's always been like this. It's always been.. like this. It's always.. John?
