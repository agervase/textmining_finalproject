Nick and I had been best friends since we were in our 2nd grade class together. We'd grown up with the same interests, played the same sports, talked about math and science. During high school we developed a bit of a friendly rivalry, we both participated on the chess team and played each other often. We kept score over the years and after the last game we'd ever play together it was 117 to 114, favoring him. He usually edged me out in our competitions; he'd won Valedictorian, and when we both pursued the same girl in our Senior year she chose him.

&#x200B;

Our friends and family all congratulated us when we were both accepted to the same Ivy League school, which was the first choice for both of us. We were roommates through all of school, shared the same classes, and took the same summer trips. We were inseparable is what I'm trying to say. That continued after we graduated and both landed jobs in a very selective department of Big Pond Solutions, a major tech developer.

&#x200B;

We were among a dozen engineers and physicists working on a secret project studying temporal phenomena. The holy grail of science, Time Travel. There wasn't much our division had really been able to do yet, though we did create a probe that could detect the atmospheric pressure up to 167 hours in the future. That little advancement did wonders in the field of meteorology and storm prediction, and provided the funding and motivation to keep us going.

&#x200B;

Which leads me to the one year anniversary of us working at Big Pond. We were working late, as usual, in the temporal lab. I'd brought a bottle of white wine to celebrate with and put out a third chair and a third glass. "Hey Nick, if either of us ever actually does it. You know if we can actually make it back to the past. Let's come back to this moment right here." I filled the third glass and put it on the table before reaching out to shake on it.

&#x200B;

At that exact moment his head exploded in a shower of blood and he fell backwards out of the chair. I freaked out, spinning around to see well...Me. I was older but obviously it was me, I was in a normal dress shirt and slacks, but blood was soaking into the light blue fabric of my shirt. I started to exclaim but the other-me cut me off.

&#x200B;

"Stop! I don't have time to explain everything. I just changed the past in a major way and the propagation wave is going to erase my timeline, erase ME. So just listen." As he spoke he was at our big white board quickly making small changes to the formula we had on it. "I had to do what I did, you need to trust me. Everything goes very bad and this is going to fix it. You need to memorize these changes and erase the board. Do you understand?"

&#x200B;

I was still hysterical at this point and screamed at him "No I don't understand any of this! What the hell is going on? Nick is a good guy, why in hell would-" But it was too late, other-me disappeared with a ringing clap of thunder as the air molecules rushed in to fill the void his disappearance left. I studied the board for a moment and erased it before picking up the lab phone and calling security for help.

&#x200B;

I was arrested. I mean I shouldn't have been surprised since my story was crazy and my partial fingerprints were found on the bullet fragments. I was vilified in the media, portrayed as seeking an insanity defense after murdering my best friend in cold blood. In the end I served 10 years of a 20 year sentence. I tried to get re-employed at Big Pond, but they wanted nothing to do with me. No major company did, and so I ended up working tech support and small freelance gigs doing engineering and programming. I was comfortable financially but I was still haunted by that one night.

&#x200B;

I kept tabs on Big Pond as best I could, I studied their public records for any hint of news about the secret lab we worked in. I paid off a janitor with a huge chunk of my savings and managed to get access to the old archives and get the sensor readings from the night of the murder. I had one thing Big Pond didn't and that was the knowledge of the changes other-me had made to the calculations. I couldn't get anywhere near recreating time travel, but I've managed to create a few ways of interacting with the temporal flow.

&#x200B;

And I don't think what other-me tried to stop is stopped. Big Pond made a multi-billion dollar Defense Contract a year ago. Worse than that things have been changing. People are saying it's just the Mandela Effect, a trick of human psychology, but I know it's not. I remember visiting the Eiffel Tower with Nick during a college backpacking trip, and now everybody "knows" it was destroyed in 2013 during a terror attack when we were still in High School. I can't find any of the pictures we took now, but I found a picture on Facebook from our trip that shows the memorial. Whatever the other-me tried to stop by killing Nick is still happening so we have to try another way.

&#x200B;

I can't recreate time travel, but I learned enough from the data generated that night to know how to block it. I've altered the temporal fields, the other-me won't be able to travel back and kill Nick that night in the lab. I know that's a big change, I know it'll create a propagation wave, I know I'll be erased, and I know that alone isn't enough to stop whatever is happening. So I've done one other thing to give my past self a fighting chance.

&#x200B;

I sent this back for myself to find. It's easier to alter a few electrons than it is to send matter back through time. I know you (I?) consider yourself a writer. I know you'll find this here. I've changed the names and enough details that others shouldn't be able to figure out who you are even if they see this. But I'm hoping it will resonate with you. You have to figure out what's going on, you have to stop whatever they're doing without our best friend having to die to do it. If I calibrated this correctly the prompt I'm replying to was posted in late 2018, that means you still have time. "Nick" didn't die in my timeline until September 17th, 2021. The last clue I can give you to help is this: When you're thinking a cubic root you're thinking too small. I'm sorry it's vague, but it'll make sense when you need it.
