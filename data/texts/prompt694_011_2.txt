ANNA

I always knew I was irrelevant. From day one every adventure, every opportunity, every interesting thing that happened to her had always passed me by. They always tell you that you’re in control of your own destiny, but honestly? Everything I’ve ever tried has always just seemed to…fade away. As if nothing I did mattered.

When I found out that Camilla was the main character, it all finally made fucking sense. But something inside me just cannot let it go. I can’t just accept that this is my life- that this is my role. I went to talk to Ant about it but he actually pretended like he didn’t know what I was talking about. Of COURSE he would say that. Sometimes I can’t stand his obliviousness.

My entire life is a side story. It’s nothing. I’m nothing to nobody.

So, if my life can’t be something, then maybe her life can be. Something awful. Something painful. Wouldn’t that make for a good story, dear readers??

Something is not right with Anna. And I’m worried. Really worried. She came to my room last night with a look in her eyes that I’ve never seen before. She’s always been...eccentric, to say the least, but this new shit was something else. She came to me like she’d just had a huge revelation, talking about how she’s figured out that she’s “not the main character in her life.” She said she knows that it’s one of the girls from her new job.

 I’m not going to tell our parents yet, but someone needs to do something before this escalates and she has another episode like she did 3 years ago. If she starts spiraling now, I really don’t know if we’ll be able to handle it again. I think I need to go to the only person I’ve ever known that can level with her. They haven’t spoken since the last incident. She’s not going to like it but I’ll just have to deal with the brunt of it, because I can’t let something like what happened before happen again.
