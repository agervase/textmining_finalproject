I awoke to the gentle beeping of my alarm clock. Wait, that wasn't right. My alarm clock sounded like R2-D2. The sunlight streaming in through the window was like a thousand daggers in my eyes. Squinting as I looked around, I saw that the beeping was coming from a sleek white machine by my bed. As my eyes adjusted, I saw that the sterile beige room I was in was several dozens of stories up. A car zipped by the window, and a moment later a police car sped by, lights blaring. It took my mind a moment to reconcile this, and I was still processing it as the door slid smoothly open, hissing slightly. A tall, sleek white cube, like a larger version of the one by my bed, floated silently into the room.

"Oh. You're up. Weird," the cube said in a bored, cool voice. I tried to sit up, but my legs and arms weren't working. "Your muscles have atrophied. Please wait." The cube floated over to me, a small glowing needle extending from its body. Unable to move, I sat helplessly as it plunged the needle into me. Seconds later, warmth flooded through my body like a hot drink on a cold day, and I hesitantly stepped  out of bed.

"Alright, I guess first things first," I said to the cube, putting a hand on it to steady myself. "Let's start with...who are you, what's the date, where am I, and how did I get here?." The cube was now scanning me with a variety of instruments.

"I'm an automatic neurological nurse android. Call me Anna. It's July 3, 2137. You're in a Union Research Hospital. You suffered a partial aneurysm a hundred and twenty years ago and went into a coma. A hundred and ten years ago you were put in stasis by Union researchers. Three months ago they fixed your brain." The cube rattled this off without a hint of interest.

A hundred and twenty years. The last thing I remembered was going to bed. I had been...happy. Really happy. But about what? I slowly walked over to the window and looked out. A lot of stuff still looked sort of similar, but humanity had obviously come a long way. Looking down, I could see hundreds of vehicles at varying heights, all moving at breakneck speeds but apparently avoiding each other perfectly.

"You have a guest," said the nurse. I turned around to see a professional-looking young man standing in the door. He smiled. "Good afternoon, sir. My name's Marty. I'm a junior account manager with Union Multifinancial. Do you have a few moments?" I nodded silently, dazed. I was still processing everything else, but this guy was probably just trying to do his job.

The young man pushed a button on his wrist, and a screen appeared in front of him. "Mr...Smith? Derek Smith? Born 1982?" I nodded again. He stood and walked over to me, extending his wrist. "Put your finger on the screen, please." I did, and the screen turned green. He grabbed the floating screen out of midair and turned it so I could read it.

"Now, I'm required to mention that your previous investment firm was absorbed by Union Financial in 2072. This was a legal change only and caused no deviation in your-"

"Wait, my investment firm?" I interrupted. 

"Yes, you invested 19.5 million in lottery winnings. As you can see, a few of your stocks did very well. Your net worth is now 102.6 billion dollars."

The machine at my bedsides started beeping loudly and rapidly as I felt my heart do a conga in my chest. I sank back onto my bed. This was getting to be too much, and the last thing I wanted to hear was the cool voice of the nurse saying, "You have another visitor."
