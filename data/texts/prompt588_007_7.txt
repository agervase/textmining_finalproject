It was five in the morning and all was not well. On my usual patrol through the castle before breakfast in the mess I came opun a harrowing sight. Some nave wished harm on his majesty, the most beloved King Hue Mann. This was not so rare an occurrence as one might hope, despite how beloved and glorious our liege is. Luckily I’ve thwarted such attempts in the past and will surely do so in the future, this one was not unlike many of the others and so I got right to work.

Today the villains had set a trap for his majesty. On sniffing through some of the drawers which were left ajar enough for me to open I came on the dastardly deed.  They were paired fabrics, colored white and just about the size of the king’s feet. Innocuous as they might have seemed I knew better. For one they were shaped not entirely unlike, though very different from a woodland creature. This shape was to throw us off the scent, because they did not look like the most evil of monsters, whom our liege refers to as the *squirrel*. These folded things could hide any number of terrible tricks, traps, who knows what. There was only one thing to do. They had to be destroyed. All of them.

It was a lot of work, but I was good at my job. Protecting his liege did give me joy, but if I’m being honest, there was also a lot of pleasure in this wanton act of destruction. Sure it isn’t right to relish in the end of things, but if you are going to have to do it, you might as well enjoy it. Chasing the vile *squirrels* is better, but they always get away an their traps, these white things would make a decent stand in. My only hope is that the king doesn’t awaken before I am through the grisly deed or he might accidentally fall victim to one.

The time is now six thirty, the king has unfortunately awoken. Sadly he was unnerved by the attempt on his life, not that I blame him, and instantly started to scream. He called my name several times and then just wailed, “No no no.” Of course he was still fresh with the shock of realizing that once again, someone is trying to do him in. In the past when he was met with such adversity he would usually try to take care of things himself, often chasing me and fighting with me to acquire the thing which was left to harm him. I understand his desire and love of his most faithful subject so of course I keep away from him as long as I can. Sometimes he even makes it into a fun game of keep away.  Luckily today there was a fair head start before he even awoke and most of the work was already done.

When I had Chase put down, it was quite a shock to for a moment see things through his eyes. Of course no one would believe me that this happened, the vision I mean, but these stories still remain as a touching tribute to why my next pet was a cat. This expert came from the day Chase had somehow gotten into my sock drawer and destroyed them all before I had to take him to the vet for to have a foreign body removed; several remains of my wool socks. Pets are expensive, but this dog set me back three grand that day.
