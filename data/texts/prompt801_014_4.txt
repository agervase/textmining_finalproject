 

Uma slowly stirred her spoon, mixing the sweetener into her coffee. A weak huff reached her ears. 

“I thought you said fake sweeteners caused cancer.” 

Her eyebrow twitches as she blows away the steam curling up from her cup, peering out from the window in front of the kitchen sink. It was night in the city, and their — her apartment was just high enough to have that quintessential city view. Fingers tapping against the edge of the sink, she hums, looking right through the incorporeal snake-being that had taken up residence on the building across. It had looped its gigantic body around the building, settling its head on the roof to sleep. Its neon yellow eyes looked directly into Uma’s kitchen. 

She hums as she takes a sip of her coffee. It burns her tongue.

*Rose had been waiting in their apartment — had been waiting since she died. Uma could tell because Rose never liked waiting and had started pacing around their living room.*

The snake falls away from view as Uma turns around and leans against the counter, debating with herself, before making her way to the kitchen table. The cheap plastic digs into her elbows.

*“Baby, please.” Rose pleads, and it twists something in the depths of Uma’s stomach. “Please, please, please, please, please.”* 

*The mug burns in her hand as Rose’s voice breaks. Somehow, this is harder to listen to compared to the screams she was greeted with when she came home that first day. It’s hard not to flinch when Rose grabs for her hands, her face, to caress and comfort and* beg.

Rose calms, after a while. After about a few hundred cups of coffee. Uma never thought she could consume as much as she could, but when it’s the only thing you’re putting into your body she supposes it all adds up. She gets less sleep than when she was pursuing her masters. 

But. Rose is always there. Her anchor goes from the living and extends to the from door and Uma works from home, so Rose is always there at the edge of her vision. 

Always.
