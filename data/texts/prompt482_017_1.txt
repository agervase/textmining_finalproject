Beep beep, beep beep, beep beep, "Ugh," *CRACK* goes my alarm as I smash yet another one. That made, I think the 6th or 7th in a row? I wasn't counting at that time, it was good they were so cheap at the dollar store that's within walking distance. I roll over to grab my remote to turn on my TV to hear, "The red menace himself is at it again, Spider-Man has recklessly dragged around yet another goon around a wild goose chase around the city causing millions of America's taxpayers countl-"

*THUD as the TV cuts off and i notice the popcorn ceiling above you start to rattle and snow tiny flakes all over my room*

"HEY, CUT IT OUT UP THERE." I yell to my neighbors above me, but when it happens again, they yell and scream, but not back at me, this time I notice it's not just from above, but from every direction. I jump out of bed and try to jump into my costume just in case it's him again. 

"WE GOTTA GET THE H*LL OUTTA HERE" the room beside me screams. And now I'm really in high gear, I jump out into the hall of my crudy apartment, still feeling sluggish.

But I run down the hall.

I won't lose him again.

Not this time.

I finally breach to the outside to see Rhino chasing around Spider-Man being dumbfounded because last I saw, he was in an overkill prison cell aboard the Helicarrier. I scream to Spider-Man "HEY, LEAD HIM OVER HERE." Spidey gave me a thumbs up and swung around back to my direction. Rhino noticed me and starting running towards me, one of the last things I remember was seeing him webbed up and terrified, but I don't remember anything. Recalling all of this back to the here and now where the same thing happens but the suit that my ex girlfriend tailored for me months ago was gone as I dig through my closet.

And there was no Spider-Man to be chased.
