Deep beneath the surface of London, in the oldest parts of the sewers, lies a secret kept for nearly a millennium. The Cult of Drakh has worked tirelessly inside the damp, brick tunnels. Scientists from the outer reaches of society, and even modern "mages", have slowly and meticulously been crafting a masterpiece in the dark caves.

Initially the goal was a simple one; increasing the size, and perhaps, the awareness of a few species of reptiles. Slowly attempting to domesticate and train them.

Once the initial goal was achieved, progress was seriously hampered. The creatures were showing progress in size and intelligence, but they lacked certain attributes that the architects wished to see. 

Timed passed easily for the architects, as they solely focused on their work.

Nearly 400 years from the conception of their creation, they had finally achieved a breakthrough - wings wings, and the ability to actually use them. The architects were elated.

Over time, the creature learned how to use their wings and slowly gained a mastery of flight. Only one more thing was needed.

This next attribute took much longer than anticipated. During this time, the architects were able to slowly increase the size of their creations to nearly 15 meters tall on average, requiring much larger chambers. Due to this, the rate of change slowed for their creatures, but they did still see progress towards their goal.

And then, finally, it happened. 

A little over 950 years from the conception of the Cult of Drakh, the architects had achieved their final goal, the ability to breath fire.

The worlds first, true dragon. The job of the Architect was finally complete. 

Now the Placer collects the first egg. They travel to the first location that was decided on. They watch over the egg until it hatches and then feed it for the first week or two, until it gains the strength to hunt.

Seven eggs have been placed since the first creation. Now we wait.
