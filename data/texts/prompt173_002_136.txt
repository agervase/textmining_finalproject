There are many among us who wonder *why* we allow Warrior Species to live. Whenever we discover one of them, there will inevitably be a movement pushing for their extermination before they reach the stars. I do not need to explain why, we all remember the horrors of the Zandrian Fleet sweeping across the Alliance Systems. More often than not, when a Warrior Species reaches the Stars they will seek new conflicts. This inevitably leads to Interstellar Wars, which also inevitably end with the aggressor's entire civilization dismantled and relegated back to their Home System.

There are many who believe that we should not give Warrior Species a chance to rise up. There are many who see the horrors of these wars, and believe that we should act preemptively. These voices scream in unison, "Kill the beast in its crib, so that it may not devour us all." To these cries... I give a single counterpoint: The Humans.

The Humans are one of the Elder Species, who moved among the Stars while most of us were still painting pictures on cave walls. Their Civilization spread through their Local Cluster with incredible speed. They expanded out with unprecedented speed, their available resources increasing exponentially with the passage of time. They came to dominate their own cluster, and all eight neighboring clusters, before internal conflict caused this rapid expansion to slow... as resources turned towards armed conflict among themselves.

The Human Civil War was the result of one of Humanity's quirks: They were not, and still are not, a unified species. There are *five* Human Nations in Space. Although they are closely allied in the present day, they once warred with each-other over valuable resources and colonies. The Humans arguably invented Interstellar War, developing many of the tactics still used today in their conflicts among themselves.

However... one will notice that we do not often acknowledge the fact that Humans *are* a highly competitive Warrior Species. This is because the Humans hate **nothing** as much as they hate War. All five Human Nations *despise* war with a passion that is difficult to describe. They do not want to go to war, they do not enjoy fighting wars, and they want their wars over with as quickly as possible with as little bloodshed as possible. Thus... they are the only known species to use Terror Weapons. 

Humanity has not gone to war in living memory because of one simple truth, which most sapient creatures do not care to remember: Humanity is the most **brutal** species in the Galaxy. When they go to War, they do not play by any rules. They bring City-Buster and Planet-Buster class weapons to the table. They unleash chemical and biological weapons upon their enemies. They do not merely kill, they bring suffering and agony well beyond what most sapient creatures can conceive of.

Yet... it's hard to reconcile that with what the Humans do today. The Humans are known best for their Terraforming and Uplifting projects. They turn the majority of their resources towards seeding life on lifeless worlds, and elevating promising species to sapience so that they could bring them to the stars. They are renowned for their humanitarian efforts, as their fleets are always among the first to respond in the event of a disaster... or an impending disaster. Countless worlds have been saved from extinction-level events by a Human Fleet settling into orbit, stabilizing a declining climate, silencing super-volcanos, and towing asteroids into a stable orbit for mining.

Perhaps more importantly, the Humans do not tolerate aggression in or towards their neighbors. When War comes to their neighbors... the Humans arrive to end it. The mere presence and threat of Humanity arriving to end a war is often enough to prevent it from starting.

The Humans are the reason that we tolerate Warrior Species. Because, somehow, a Warrior Species became one of the most beloved species in the Galaxy.
