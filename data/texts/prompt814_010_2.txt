Life gets better and better. I never thought I`d hate it.  Everyday, I have dreams like flowing streams--it tells me what`s at the end of it. But, you`d be surprised were it ends (or maybe not).

I wake up very early, usually by 3:30 AM. No rooster ever caught me with my eyes close, mind you. I`d like to say I`m a hard worker, but most of the time I`d say I`m lazy. That`s why everyday`s got to be planned--every detail of it. Morning bath. Check. Hopelessly white-ish teeth. Check. Smell. Check. Morning schedule. Maybe later. Afternoon Schedule. You get the picture. I think I`m fired up. Then, the day begins. I`d kill the guy who ever said when you fail to plan, you`re planning to fail. But, something tells me his already dead. 

Nothing really goes as planned, you know; but sometimes good enough is good enough. I get my three meals a day that`s good enough, isn`t? I`d get to work by 6:30 AM. Early birds get no worms, quote me on that. Its the boss who pays for your feathers. I still come early coz work doesn`t get any less coming late. Did I say I work in finance? We work like tomorrow is yesterday. It`s probably easier to say it goes on and on. 

“Jeff, here you go.” A happy pile of paper sieged my desk. I watched its sides effortlessly fell my mug. I hate it when it spills out the pencils. 

“What`s this, Dick,” I watched his eyes. They looked like they`re going to eat me. 

“Fredrick. That`s doesn`t even sound close.”

“It rhymes.” I tried to hide my smile. “Besides, that`s what everybody calls you. They`d hate me to call you anything less.”

“Its Fred, alright,” he shouts covering as much of the office ground as possible. Everybody heard it. No one listened. 

“Anyway, I need this done by Wednesday, the boss is gone kill me if these doesn`t get on his desk on time.” He points his fingers at me. 

“Let him. I`ve got my plans. Last weeks papers hasn`t been processed yet. Are you kidding me.”

“And I say forget it. Wednesday, Jeff.” Just like that he left my office. I forgot to tell him his zipper was open or did I?

Kill Dick inside my head. Check. 

No surprise there. I don`t think I needed my dreams to tell me that`ll happen. Lately, I`ve been having premonitions. I don`t think it`s fair to call it like that, though. Everynight, as I sleep, I`d wake in my dreams. I`d be floating or flying, I don`t really know, within a gentle flowing stream and beams of spectral light running pass me. Then, I hear something like murmurs. I can make the words, “the river ends where the sea begins.” I think that`s what I hear. Then, I`d see some of the lights zig zag beside me. I can make a shape--its very familiar. I still think I`m better looking, but other than that, I guess I got nothing. 

“Hello, Jeff.” The chill of that sound never left, even when I thought I`ve gotten used to it. Quite haunting to hear you own voice coming from someone else--maybe not someone else. He looks exactly like me. He`s older; but, hey, he`s wearing a shiny suit--its fits well too--just like every turd bags who leaves all their turd on my desk. He, then, points ahead of us. 

I see visions of scenes about to happen. There, I think I just saw Rica drop her pen and I reached for it. Nice one hotshot. The pile of Dick`s turd (ehem, papers) is looking good. The boss congratulates me, Dick doesn`t look too happy. Great time with my buds, Rica`s there too. I think I kissed her. I look good for a Wall Street zombie. 

“Remeber where the river ends, Jeff.”

“I got it, Jeff.”

“You`ll have all that you desire and more. See it through, won`t you?”

Then, I woke up. And so, here I am in my office looking at the pile of papers on my desk. I think my name`s Dick in the future.

I thought it strange then that just before I could lift my firgers to a sheet, I felt a sudden attack of haziness and my lids covered the balls of my eyes. I fell asleep. 

“Jeff, wake up.” He wasn`t suppose to bother me at work. I`m wasting time sleeping. 

“What`s wrong with you. It`s the middle of the day.” Then I stared right at him. I probably took longer than I should but something`s wrong. He looked centuries old. I think I never saw teeth so gapped, atleast it`s more than white-ish. His head like the empty desert sands leaving little strands of hairs jotting out. His violet suit covered in unwavering dusts. He looks like death but way older. I saw him with one hand carrying the burden of his head, sitting or floating, I don`t really know, dead tired. 

“Jeff,” I called. He looked at me with bony cheeks, eyes hollowed with emptiness. 

“Remeber, where the river ends.”

“Everybody knows were the river end. What wrong with you?” He points towards my heart and I felt a deep ache within. I wanted to claw it out. “Where it ends? The ocean?”

“With me, Jeff.” 

Then, I woke up. 

I stopped dreaming my dreams ever since. I don`t really know what to think of it all. Heck, I don`t know if it made me any better than I was before. Guess, I`ll keep being me. 

Look, Rica dropped her pen again. I think she`s doing it on purpose. I reached for it. Nice one hotshot.
