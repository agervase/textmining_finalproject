The wooden floorboards creaked in this musty part of the vault.  She had only passed through a few times during her tenure here.  All of the hourglasses here had run their course eons ago, and it had been her predecessors who oversaw this section - ominously referred to as the Tomb.

Her wiry fingers retrieved the wayward one from beneath the hefty writing desk - a gift to one of the earliest iterations of her kind by one of the Timekeeper gods.  Immediately, sand began to trickle and swirl, mesmerizing her for a moment as it so often did.

She imagined a young child, alone and shivering in an alleyway.  Each grain of sand a hope or a wish that he had a family who loved him, warm food in his belly, or shoes that didn't expose his toes.

She saw an elderly woman, surrounded by loved ones.  Smiles, tears, laughs...tales told of ages past, of her loves, and her fears...of pranks and holidays.

She drifted idly above crashing waves in the sea, of a captain furiously urging his men to bear the brunt of the squall, wave after wave, until the boat began to keel.

When her senses returned to the hourglass, she saw the last grains swirling through the funnel, falling to join its brothers below.  When the last grain touched down, she felt a rush of air through the Tomb, and heard around her the growing whisk as each hourglass upon the shelves there began to turn to sand themselves and blow away toward the black emptiness beyond the walls.

Curious and confused, she looked back at the hourglass she held, turning it on its side to read the label upon the bottom:

*Reality*  it read.  "Oh...well..."  She looked around nervously, then noticed a scrawl of letters below...

*FLIP TO BEGIN AGAIN*
