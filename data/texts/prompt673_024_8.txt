"So this is how it end." Life, ephemeral and shining, the last light in the universe, sat on cold dead earth.

"Yes." My voice was raspy, my time was growing short as well. I could feel the weight of all the eons that Life carried so easily.

Life was silent for a time, looking into the sky, watching and waiting for it to come crashing down. "I did a pretty good job, didn't I?"

"You did. I was... very busy." 

"Mmm." Life replied, and silence returned once more. "How much longer do we have?"

"Not much." I admitted.

Life turned and looked at me in surprise, "You mean you don't know?"

"Not offhand." I offered, "But where else am I to go?"

Life stared for a moment, then blinked. Then Life laughed. A chuckle at first, then a guffaw, followed by a roaring peel of laughter that bounded back from the edge of the universe. It was only when I began to laugh as well that Life began to subside, reduced to a final nervous giggle before ending.

I fell silent as well, watching the way Life looked at me. Shock was written over it's face. "I didn't know you could..."

"I haven't had a lot of need to." I replied.

Life stared for a moment more. "Do you think I'll do better next time?"

"Yes. Yes I think you will." I hefted my scythe.

"Thanks." Life smiled at me as doom raced towards it. "See you again soon."

My scythe sliced through Life, ending it as quickly as all the others. "See you again soon." I murmured, and closed my eyes as the universe itself careened into me, crushing my corporeal form into less than dust.

Everything that had been everywhere compressed into the most infinitesimal speck with me at the center.

And then there was a very loud bang.
