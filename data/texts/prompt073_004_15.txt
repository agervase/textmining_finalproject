You thought they were horsemen. Some brave soul in a past age, one that is now dying, had the wisdom, foresight, and depth of perception to uncover higher truths about the world, and the mystery of life. 

Christ, the man, and his disciples were men of high spiritual discipline, they were the great seeds who’s truthful words begot an entire era of their reign. One of the many gifts they experienced as a result of their high level of consciousness, was that of foresight. In the mysterious and veiled book of revelations, Christ and his disciples give account of visionary experiences, during which they channeled often poetic and dramatic images of true events that would come to pass in the future of the planet. 

In one of the most well known of these visions, the end of days is described. This is not meant to be understood as the actual complete end of days, it is meant to mark a time of great transformation of the human species upon the planet earth. The book of revelation discusses four harbingers of this end of days. 

**Death**
The bringer of death to many, this can be interpreted as both a literal plague of death, or as the death of an old age, giving way to something greater.

**war**
He who commands war commands al the nations of the world. A duplicitous character, he can represent war and division among men, or the war between what has passed in the age, and what will be in the next. 

**Famine**
As world population rises, a greater number of individuals find themselves in poverty. There is also a deep hunger in the race to advance, a feeling that something is missing.

**Conquest**
The character of conquest rides on a divided world, and unifies it underneath the global flag.  Conquest, it is little known, is actually the savior in this story. 


Like any good hero, conquest would, in the time of the end, set out to defeat the other horsemen, bringing peace and light to a new age of humanity, one freed from the sins of the past. 

But that was a misunderstood, metaphorical story in revelation...

A two thousand year old book looking foreword to the end of the era it was just beginning. We now have a much more finite view of that end, and what may have been meant in that vision. We live in a world of people. Political and social figures become media sensations, and are able to significantly alter the course of life on the planet. It is possible to now understand that the horsemen foreseen as prophets of the end times, were in fact real, they were actual people, who would appear on the earth and make such a mess of things that there would be no choice but for the citizens of the world to remake the world in an entirely new way. 

Four horsemen. We now know, were truly five. One, conquest, is meant to lead the shift in consciousness, but another stepped up to fill the fourth mantle, only, he wouldn’t ride a horse, he couldn’t even drive a car! But we will get to him in a moment, as he is a part of the newer knowledge that we have gained as we approach this end of days, foreseen so many years ago. 

If we wish to identify the individuals in today’s world who actually are these four horsemen, we only need to trace the things they are said to cause back to the human individual who is the largest source of that thing in the world.

For famine, we can search the entire world, we see that famine exists in all nations, but mostly in those of the Middle East, and Africa. We can trace the causes of famine back several decades. World War Two was a precursor to many of the modern worlds problems. The alliances and invasions that were undertaken as a result of this war caused a dramatic shift in the balance of wealth and resources in the worlds poorest nations. Take this, coupled with his death camps, where millions were literally starved to death, and. We can point to none other than Adolf Hitler as one of the horsemen today the apocalypse. The earliest on the scene and the first to depart it, he served as a catalyst for the rest. The others would arrive together, and we are just now witnessing their power.

The trained spy, assassin, and man who regularly has anyone in his way murdered, the veritable tzar of modern Russia is death.  Vladimir Putin is the modern death, cold, calculated, and without just cause. Death pulls all the strings towards himself, and is the mastermind leading the end of days. Without death, rebirth cannot arise. He is nearly impossible to outwit, and seems to control many of the worlds forces. Including war.

War is scarlet red, or maybe bright orange. Either way he looks as though his head were on fire, like a shock of yellow flame for hair. War causes division among men, among men and women, among people who are meant to be neighbors and coworkers. War coerces many to believe their cause is just, when it seems that there can be no cause in *truth* To go to war. War lies. War is a lie. Donald Trump, our hot-headed president of the United States has divided a nation, and the world. In a way that has not been done before. This division seems as though it has fractured the very foundation of the modern world, and political system.

The world stage is set, those evil forces which make up two thirds of our story, the rise of famine, and the subsequent and simultaneous rise of death and of war, have set the stage for the final act, the great battle when good, conquest, comes in the form of a person, who has not yet been discovered, and may not appear for some time still, to overpower the forces set into motion by these figures, and bring about a peaceful world. 

There has been one piece of information that was never discussed, for it was not understood, even in metaphor, there is a passage of the book of revelation that has rarely seen print, although it appears in some very important ancient manuscripts on the book. Bible scholars reference him as the ‘horseless horseman’ because he is said to ride an invisible horse. I’m the ancient Aramaic, the language of the Bible, there exists a word which directly translates to ‘silliness’ it is thought to have had several meanings, but in any other example of it, this is the only meaning that can be taken seriously.

 It is thought that this silly horseless horseman would be a figure of a different plague, he is thought to imbue ignorance in those who take pleasure in his antics, he will dance through life, leaving meaningless distraction in his wake, meaning that he will destroy the minds of men, as well as physical destruction. There has only been one figure in modern history who has exemplified this trait to its highest degree. Mr bean came along at the beginning of the middle section of this earthly story. Acting as a beacon of silliness, his form of slapstick and destruction based humor would inspire the comedy of a generation. He would stumble through life, bringing a love of ignorance to the world through silliness. Not riding a horse of an institution like the others, but walking among the people. He began this stage, and his work is done. He fit into the plan, and has set the stage for this final event. 

When conquest arrives, a great battle will occur, until then, perhaps we can just sit back, and enjoy watching a grown man ridiculously wandering the streets and leaving destruction in his wake.
