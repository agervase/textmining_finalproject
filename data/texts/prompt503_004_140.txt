My wife was always so submissive and it always turned me on. She gave into my carnal needs and would never say no. I even tested a few things that I would never have thought to ask of a lover and still she allowed me. When I would feel guilty about the extent of our sexual adventures, she assured me that she wanted more. It got to the point that I couldn’t think of anything beyond what I have done. Because of this, it seemed as if she had become complacent with me. She began staying out late. She stopped having sex with me. Then the next thing I knew, I was brought into custody and here I am telling my side of the story.

“Sir, her perception piece recorded the entirety of your ‘marriage.’ You were with her for a mere three months and everyday she had told you she hated you but you’re telling us that she said she had to have you. She told you no more, and you’re telling us that she said she needed more. You say you couldn’t top yourself, but in the recording, it depicts you telling her to come up with her own ideas. She was so scared to come up with something she began seeking help. And after all of this, you’re saying the perception piece is responsible for you imprisoning this young lady for three months?”

I don’t know what to say. I moved here to be with her. We met online and we fell in love. We had a private VR marriage and she immediately quit working because I swore she didn’t need to. I think it’s rather convenient that the court only has her perception piece! Don’t you think it’s peculiar that the officers lost my piece? Don’t you think it’s rather strange that my wife began these allegations after my money transferred to her account?

“Are you really implying that our justice system, our technology companies, and even our citizens are all working to together to con you out of your money?!”

Yes, that’s exactly what I’m implying!

“If only you had your perception piece to prove it…”
