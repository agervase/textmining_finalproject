*Does it ever get lonely?*

This is what my mind speaks to me as I huddle in the darkness, a faint voice that whispers these words to me. I look up from my knees, arms wrapped against them.

“Always” I respond, my voice weak and soft against the hard environment.

Sometimes the words are kind, sometimes the words are harsh, as if to make me angry, to make me want to fight, but now the words are just soothing, like a mother trying to calm her crying babe. The voice doesn’t have a gender, or even a voice though, more like a presence. A daunting presence that always presents itself at night. I look at the grey walls that are shrouded in darkness, imagining the bricks splitting apart as they reveal a light that would guide me out of this hole. No light appears though as my fingers graze the rough surface, feeling the divots in the stone, my hand eerily calm as my mind shakes and weeps softly.

I hear the heavy sound of footsteps approaching, though my eyes still fix on the wall. I can smell the rust of their bars as the door to my cell swings open, the clinging of the men’s swords as their scabbards collide with the moving metal. I can taste the smoke coming off their torches. One of the men says something to the other man, but I can’t make out the meaning, I can’t understand the words that flow from their harsh faces.

*Don’t fight it this time*.

I flinch at the words in my head, not sure how to react. The words cut every time, like a dagger poking through my mind. The voice doesn’t usually tell me to give up though, even on the worst days. I look up as the men at the door stare down at me, swords having been drawn now. I wonder if this is the last time that I will see these grey walls, or anything at all for that matter, but I always think that. Every time. No matter how many times it happens, no matter how many times I wake back up in this dark place, no matter how many times I wake up with a new scar or two or three.

Blood runs down my hand now, warm blood among the cold interior of the cell. My fingers are still gripping the walls as the men pull me up and away from my corner. Another smear gets added to the wonderful masterpiece of that I have created, a masterpiece of despair that I add to every time. Hundreds of streaks from hundreds of visits. Is this my destiny now? A life filled with constant fear and anguish that never ceases to conclude? I don’t have anything of value to these people, no form of currency, no information that any would deem valuable. Yet here I am, being dragged away once again. Destiny sucks.

*Fuck destiny. I’m getting you out of here.*

A flash of light shatters the darkness, spreading blood and flesh across my artwork, but not my own flesh or my blood. A figure stands before me, shrouded in a cloak of mist his sword coming to a final ark as the heads of both men come to their own conclusion. A conclusion that rolls across the floor, leaving more art in their wake.

The figure moves towards me, its mist filling my cell as it makes its way around the bodies. I should move, I should press my back against the cell in fear. I should do something, but I don’t. I look up at its hooded face and feel a sense of comfort and relief.

*It's time to go.*
