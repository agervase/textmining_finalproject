"OMG! Can we keep it? Can we keep it??"

"Yra, please. We are to conquer this planet, not marvel at the inhabitants. *District A9-173 clear.*"

"But Xauuuuub why nottttt?! If we're taking over anyway why can't I have just one! Look at how cute it is!!"

"You know I will not repeat a sentence I just spoke a few ticks ago. *Moving on to district A9-174.*"

"Okay... but what about this one?! What's your name little thing?"

The human hesitated, what was this creature speaking to him about? What did it want from him? Why did it appear to plead with the other creature? "Uh, I don't really understand you..." he spoke carefully.

"Wait, did it just... speak? That's so cu- nevermind. *District A9-175 clear.*"

"Nooooo stop clearing all the districts please just let me have at least one Xaub!"

"Come on, we only have a few districts left before we can report back the the ship. Instead of giggling over the humans we come across help me!"

The duo continued on, crossing paths with multiple humans.

"Xaub, Xaub, look! Over there, by the strange metal object!
  
"Yra, that's a trash can. And I don't see what you are talking abo- Holy Zar. What. Is. That."

The human looked up with wide eyes. She was dirty, thin, and shakey. She managed the words "what are you?" before scooting farther behind the garbage bin, peering out with those same eyes that caught Xaub's attention from the start. Xaub approaches her.

"This one is different Yra." He says, looking down at her. "Its hair is longer, and it looks... softer, somehow."

All Xaub wanted to do was hold it. It was just so cute. He didn't know how to react.

"*Commander Xaub to control - we are to leave this planet, and never return. Warping back to base now.*"

"Wait Xaub! How can you not want to take one? Why are we just leaving?!"

Xaub looks off into the dark, night sky. How is he supposed to react to something that adorable?
