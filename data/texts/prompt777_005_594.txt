“Bro seriously?”

“What? I just killed Hitler69, His reign is over no more bad guy. Why are you still alive by the way? My multis should have killed you.”

“I'm Allies you moron!”

“You’re not a trash mob?”

“You’re a fucking trash mob! I spent my whole life here working my way up on the inside… do you realize how hard it is to get xp when you can’t PK!?”

“Kill boars man I don know.”

“You sunuvabich, I cant believe this, where the hell is the rest of your guild?”

“Raid wiped. I had a soul stone so I popped it.”

A soulstone doesn't work in a level 90 zone!”

“Mine is from Whizzconn 06 so…”

“So you SAVED IT FOR 11 years!”

“I don’t know dude it was just in my bag,  are you sure your not a mob?”

“Are you kidding? Could I talk to you right now if I was? Would you be out of fucking combat?”

”Oh yeah… You Modding?”

“M…Modding? Are you serious? Cheating you’re calling me a cheater?”

“I don’t know man, I'm just having fun ya know, this ain't even my guy.”

“This isn’t your main?”

“Main what?”

“Main character!”

“Nah man I bought this dude on eBay.”

“…”

“Whatever man you want some of the treasure?”

“I cant roll for it I didn’t tag him.”

“Haha, oh yeah”

“I spent 4 years of my life working on this project, I rolled a dual class unaligned human and leveled up in Axis zones… I spent every weekend playing an alt so I could afford the concealment stones to hide my faction… It was gonna be the most legendary maneuver in MMO history. An inside job. A political assassination 4 years in the making! The game was only out a month when I made the choice."

“You okay man?”

“No I’m not fucking okay! My girlfriend broke up with me over this project, I had to get a fast food job and move in with my grandmother so I could keep the schedule!”

“That ain't my fault man, you need to get your life back together thats on you, this is just a game.”

“IT'S NOT JUST A GAME!”

“You mad bro?”
