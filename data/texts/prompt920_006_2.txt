"Finally", the time traveller uttered as his feet hit the tarmac. It turns out, finding everyone who tries to start a religion is hard. It's not just the killing, that can be hard too, especially in newer history. The hardest part is findingh all of them. Jesus wasn't born excactly at year 0, nor was he born at Christmas, but at least you have a time window there. Finding Siddharta Guatama gives 100s of years of leeway, and who knows when and where Hunduism was founded?

Well, the time traveller knows, at last. That's why he wore such a satisfied grin as he dusted off the time-dust from his coat. That's also why he was shocked when he hears a group of people say "Praise him" nearby. Cursing himself for having missed one, he edged closer.

"Oh see, great one, the purity of our fate, and smite down those who doubt you!" A man was standing on a podium surrounded by a semi-circle of people bowing down on the ground. "Praise him" they said, slightly louder this time. The time traveller kept walking, determined to find whomever started this and be rid of him in the past. "He who travells time to smite heathens, show mercy upon us!"

*Shit*, the time traveller thought, *Time traveller?*. He decided to head to the closest library after confirming that his phone no longer worked. Time travelling messes with telecommunication standards it seems. He looked for books on religion, but only came up with parenting books intended to introduce children to the dominant faith in this timeline. "For all of time, any man or woman who tried to make others disbelive in the Grea Timer Traveller has fallen dead with a sharp BANG". *My gun*, the time traveller realised, *they're worshipping* me*!*

*The world truly is doomed then, if it can never evolve without false gods.* It was a sobering thought, but it seemed so true. How could he prevent this? He killed every single religion in the world before it spread. Apart from one. One he could never be rid, as long as he walked this earth.

*That's it*, he thought, *I need to erase myself from this timeline if there is to be any hope.* Perhaps it would work, or perhaps his death would only serve to further the religion.

With a last sigh, the time traveller pulled his gun out, shifted through time once more and pulled the trigger.

Before him lay his dead body.
