My first use of *italics*, forgive me fam.

The sky was a meringue yellow. Afternoon sun rays were penetrating clouds, giving way to warmth Shady could feel on his skin. He was standing next to the massive landing pad for their mothership. 

*They invited me.*

He couldn’t believe it. All of the hairs on his arms stood up as a gentle breeze blew by. He would be the first human to ever interact with aliens in person. 

*All the people in the world, and they chose me. I can’t let everybody down.*

A shadow began to develop just beyond the horizon, and then the hulking gray mass of the mothership came into view. Shady’s palms began to sweat, he was trembling. 

*Just remember what Trump told you. Don’t let everybody down.*

While Shady wasn’t ready, he knew what he had to do, this was his job as Secretary of State.

As the ship grew closer Shady’s heart beat in a frenzy. He gave a hand motion to the snipers in the tall grass around the landing pad, and they sighted in their rifles. “Bzzt, Secretary Shady, the package is ready on your command Bzzt”. He reached a finger up to his ear and transmitted 1 beep for affirmative. The alien ship circled half a mile above, the turbines that powered it began to cool down, giving way to a hollow silence as it settled onto the ground. 

The ship was immense, at least a half mile in all directions. It was a gray floating empire. Shady noted there were no visible doors or windows. He was shaking now, unprepared for what the next five minutes would bring for mankind. 

In an instant a cylinder of light shot up from the center of the ship through clouds. There was a piercing sound, it shook Shady’s ear drums, and burned out his transmitter. He regained his footing. 

*Small scale EMP? How did they know? Is this precaution?*

The light began to bellow and boom in a commanding voice “SHADY, WHO IS THE ONE WHO IS SHADY” 

Shady, both confused and scared, hesitated. He was blinking rapidly to adjust to the light, his hands were still cupped over his ears, a tear ran down his face. 

*This is too much.*

“WHO IS THE SLIM SHADY”

***

To be a young boy from 8 mile, coming out of Detroit. This is more than he could have ever dreamed. He had grown out of poverty and into fame, and finally had begun his political career.

*Is this how I die?...Is this how we all die?*

A beam of light shot from the gray ship and surrounded Shady. He began to levitate outside of his control. He could not move his body. It carried him higher into the air. He screamed, but no sound came, he was immobilized. What is happening! He was positioned opposite to the beam emanating from the ship. The voice boomed in his face, the sound waves sent his hair flying backwards. 

“WE HAVE DETERMINED YOU TO BE THE REAL SLIM SHADY. TELL US THE STORY OF EARTH”

***

A high pitched, piercing ringing overtook Shady. 

*My ears, I can’t do this.*

He then realized he could move his head, and lips, the beam had given him to ability to use his voice. 

“...Hello?” A booming immediate response shot Shady’s hair back and sent his ears recoiling. 

“THE STORY OF EARTH”

Shady regained himself. 

*It’s time.*

He collected himself, and began to speak as if he was possessed. He spoke of the ages, the seas, of mass extinction. He spoke of poverty, the rise of humanity. Most of all, Shady spoke of survival, of the ability of his race of humans to persevere in the face of hopelessness, and at the end of his auditory lesson he bellowed

“AND IF I’VE LEARNED ANYTHING, YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT, YOU CAN’T MISS YOUR CHANCE TO BLOW”

Over the pulsing sound of the ships beaming lights, one of the positioned sniper was listening for any whisper of the trigger word, and although it was faint, he heard it. A bullet stuck into Shady’s leg, releasing the pressure on the failsafe shortwave radio trigger to the nuclear warhead buried underneath the landing pad. Yellow light bathed the moments after.
