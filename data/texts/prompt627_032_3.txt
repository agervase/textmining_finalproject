“Stand down, O foul wyrm, you!”

This was the fourth time this week, and it had barely turned Tuesday.
With a disgruntled sigh, Princess Anelotta threw herself out of her chambers, grumbling up the winding spiral staircase as she approached the castle roof.
Carefully opening the hatch in the ceiling and climbing up, she found herself face to face with an equally as tired dragon, covered in grey, spiked scales with a twisted, demonic face.

“Heyo Lott. Got another knight here, want me to burn them or just spook ‘em away?”

“Give him a sec, Poofy. We don’t know if he actually presents a threat.”

The knight, undeterred, continued on with his sesquipedalian speech.

“With my blade, I seal my divine oath to wretch’th your life fibers from you, beast, and take the princess as my consort!”

“Wretch...th? Does he have a lisp or-“

“I’m gonna go with a *haaard* spook here, Poofy.”

“On it.”

Leaping from the top of the tower, Poofy 
sunk down into the ground and bellowed a mighty roar, the air knocking the knight off his feet, leaving him scampering away in terror.

“Dang, didn’t expect you to pull out the wind breath. Heh, guy’s running like he shit himself.” Anelotta chuckled, as she fist-bumped one of Poofy’s gnarled, green nails.

“Hey, you said a hard scare, girl! I’m just doin’ what you asked!” Poofy replied with a grin.
“Think we can finally do that marathon of the puppet show the peasants put on?” he followed up, motioning to a distant village.

“Well, I think we aren’t gonna have anymore weirdos questing about for today. Just let me climb on your back and-“

The sound of hooves got nearer and nearer, as a rather portly, horse bound knight strode in front of the castle.
“Sweetest Lily, that’th dost de’th locked up in thine castle! I shall undo your chains of darkness and-“


“...Lott?”

“Jesus Christ, solid burn, stat.”
