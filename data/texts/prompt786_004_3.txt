Here's the only way it would EVER be portrayed if it somehow made it onto TV.

Turns out, Bonnie's dad is a big 40k fan. Every Friday, he invites his friends over to the basement to play 40k- they use the toys as proxies if they don't have the cash or time to buy and paint models.

Cut to "imagination sequence" where Buzz, an Imperial Knight proxy, powerfists Rex the Tyranid into Hamm the Maulerfiend, exploding the two, as the Gorkanaut Mr. Potato Head turns around, Orks pouring out of his buttflap, screaming "WAAAAGH" as the players all laugh at the absurdity.

Meanwhile, Bullseye, Woody, and Jessie are sitting in the toybox, too floppy to position on the tabletop, with Mrs. Potato Head narrating the action when her eye is used as an objective marker.

After the guys leave, the 40k figures decide to get to know the proxies a bit better.

Abaddon tries to go for a handshake, but is mildly annoyed when Buzz accidentally snaps his arm off.

Rex gets glomped by a Carnifex, who has a minor crush on him.

Buzz is gushed over by the Skiitarii, who marvel at his electronic components.

The Orks declare Mr. Potato Head the new Warboss (much to Thraka's chagrin) and the Mek gives him a crapton of bits as tribute.

While initially horrified at the amount of bits strewn around, it is made a bit less grimdark by a reveal that figures only "wake up" when fully assembled.

They actually meet some of the Army Men, who were used for color tests (and actually look surprisingly good), and they reminisce about the past.

Eventually, the fact that only some of the toys are being used for the Friday night play sessions drives a wedge between the group.

How will they salvage their relationship in this 1-hour Toy Story special? Tune in on ABC this Sunday for the answer!
