I knew something was wrong when I heard the noises in the vents. It was a horrible, jangling discord, the sound of church-bells, distorted through miles of pipes and filters and boilers and forgotten machinery. Deep in the pit of my stomach, I knew right then; It was a death knell.

I didn't know what it was, but noises in the vents are a weatherer's nightmare. The bunkers were designed to be hermetically sealed, no rats, no cockroaches, not a stray goddamn headlouse. The places were sterilised to the standards they use for interplanetary spacecraft. Used to use, I mean.

Anything larger than bacteria can chew on wires, foul circuit boards. When you're talking about the survival of humanity over a hundred-year nuclear winter, that's unacceptable damage. And the maintenance drones are silent. So, if you hear something in the vents, it means that containment's been breached. It means you're fucked.

Still. There it was. And, as the last weatherer with maintenance training, it was still my duty to check it out. After all, the manuals warned, if I didn't find and fix the problem it could result in the deaths of everyone in the bunker. I chuckled hollowly at the thought.

I levered myself out of my filthy berth, banging my head on the empty bunk above me. As always, I waited for the cheerful "careful as y'go, there" from my roommate, but of course it didn't come. Alan was short, perfect from these tunnels. But now it's just me, alone in a grimy metal room with peeling paint and not enough tins and a sun-lamp that left far too few shadows to hide in.

Pulling on unwashed trousers - yesterday's, possibly, but more probably last week's - I checked my pockets for tools, checked my satchel for supplies, checked my handheld for charge. Grimly, I lifted up my mattress and dug out my modified nail-gun, shamefully hidden where I wouldn't have to think about it. I checked that was charged, too. Only one clip of nails, though. *Don't worry*, I thought, *if the problem's too dangerous for a one-clip solution, you're dead anyway.*

At some point, the noises had stopped. In some ways that made it worse. I undid the overrides I'd set on my door, and undid the bolt I'd soldered on. With a shuddering breath, I pushed myself from my sanctuary.

Checking each intersection carefully, I slunk through the tunnels that had become my home. My steel-shod boots struck too hard on the metal grates of the flooring, the cracking echoes making me wince, but I saw nobody. Presumably they wanted to talk to me as little as I to them. In one of the corridors, a light is out, creating a patch of darkness in the sterile glow. A little part of me shrunk in professional shame - that's my responsibility, I should fix that. I should have fixed it days - weeks? - ago. But closer inspection shows it'd been smashed in a scuffle, rather than a simple burn-out, and I remembered why I hadn't dared venture this far from my room.

Finally, after a five-minute eternity, I found the door I'm looking for. 'ATMOSPHERE CONTROL', claimed the stencilled-on label, the flaking red indicating it to be accessible to authorised personnel only. I pushed the door open without bothering to swipe my keycard - disabling all the locks was the opening shot in the coup, the first sign that our fragile stability had been shattered. The light control system had been next, though, which had been far worse.

Belatedly, I fumbled the nail-gun from its makeshift holster. The darkness beyond, a welcome reprieve to my exhausted retinas, could hide some ravening intruder from the surface, a vent-climbing horror from the irradiated wastelands outside. In truth, it was far more human monsters I feared, however. Either way, I was left blessedly disappointed. Just darkness, regrettably vanquished with the torch from my satchel.

The room was clean, pristine, clearly having fallen beneath the notice of the battling weatherers. After all, nobody wanted responsibility for it, and nobody wanted the air to stop working. The screen lit up as I sat at the dustless desk, the machinery in the room humming as if nothing were wrong. That was where the illusion of normalcy ended, however - a single glance showed damage, all over and in quantity. A brief triage suggested mostly internal causes, however - damaged vents, hacked panels creating airless death-zones, others turning rooms oxygen-rich combustion chambers. Nothing I didn't know, and that hadn't already haunted a hundred of my nightmares. No, what was knew was the damage to the input system. Something, it seemed, had come in through the surface vent, had broken through grills and bars on the way down, had passed through the flashcooker chamber without stopping, had ripped out filters and mangled fan-blades. It was only at the chemical cyclone chambers that the damage ended. It seems that even something that could survive the apocalypse had limits. And I felt relief, for the brief seconds it took me to note that it had broken back out through an entirely different set of input pipes. Whatever it was, it wasn't dead.

And that was when my handheld pinged an emergency tone. Level five, the worst of all. The alert simply read 'Damage to Main Blast Doors'.

Enemy at the gate.

I considered turning away. I considered hiding, locking and welding as many doors behind me as I could, fleeing and stealing and surviving on the last of my scavenged supplies in the depths of this failed environmental escape pod. I considered it. But, deep down, I knew I was dead anyway. The air-input machinery was wrecked, far beyond my capacity to fix. I was dead as soon as the air ran out. And I'd been dead far beyond that. I was dead when the suicides started. I was dead when we all started fighting over an interconnected system. I was dead when Alan walked out of the room and never came back. We were all dead since the moment the coup started.

And so, instead of running, I left the machinery room calmly. I closed the door carefully, not slamming it, as if any of it made a difference. I walked, upright and pretending not to care who heard it, towards the main entrance, where the central control room overlooked the blast doors. If any other survivors saw me, what did it matter? They knew where I was going, they knew the score. They all had handhelds, too. I saw nobody, though. My last and only act of defiance was never known to anyone, although perhaps someone heard me, in passing, as I heard a few others whimpering and scuttling through closed doors.

The stairs up to control room was worse than I'd ever dreamed, in any of my hours of fear-gripped cowering. The smell of rot and burnt flesh filled the walkways like a wall, every step into it repulsed my body like a gravitational anomaly. I threw up, and again, every few steps, until I was pulling up thin and burning bile. I stepped around the bodies, where I could, but I couldn't avoid the blood.

The room itself told a story I didn't want to know. The plasma-cut door, the hacked enviro panel, the charred, bloody bodies, all made worse because I'd shown Alan how to do those things. I taught that kid everything he knew. And what did it say about me that this was the result?

After a few minutes, I collected myself from where my mind lay shattered amongst the carnage. In a state beyond fear and disgust, I tipped a corpse - someone I knew? Not Alan, too tall - from the central chair, and took command of the main console. It didn't ask me for login details; Clearly it had been cracked thoroughly. I closed the running software, not daring to look down when I found the keyboard stick beneath my fingers. Pulling up the security suite, I opened up the camera from the decontamination airlock.

For a moment I thought it was showing an error, but it was merely overexposed, the white spark of a vast plasma jet blacking out the rest of the picture. Whatever was coming wasn't a mere waste-beast, I realised. It was cutting its way through that door. I watched for a few minutes, entranced, as the dot slowly made its way along an intricate pattern to the floor, before cutting off. As the camera's contrast stabilised, I saw a clear pattern of daylight shining through the cuts, a strange, triangular symbol, stepped in jagged ranks, that called back to something half-forgotten in my pre-fall memories. The moment of recollection was chased away, however, as the door burst inwards with a ringing explosion that I heard through three bulkheads. The silhouette of a figure was captured for a second, before the camera feed fizzled.

I sat, stunned, for a few seconds. This, I knew, was the end of the line. Standing, I swayed, drunken, from the control room, operating on no rational process of thought. I stood before the main door, the final barrier between myself and a broken, unfixable world, the nail-gun held in both hands, ready and waiting. I heard the paces through two inches of solid steel. I saw the metal buckle under two mighty blows, dishing outwards impossibly. Black-gloved fingers like Pringle tubes shoved through the gap, gripped the edges of the portal, and wrenched it open.

I think I fired one nail, perhaps two, before the shock of what I was seeing caused the weapon to drop from my shaking hands. A figure in red, huge and old and clad in furs against the bitter chill of an endless winter, with eyes burning like coals and a vast sack slung across his back. I knew this creature in my bones, knew him from a platonic shadow cast across the dying walls of a consumerist dystopia, but knew him nevertheless.

I dropped to my knees as he walked towards me, the paces leaving deep footfalls in the steel floor. He gazed down upon me.

"**You've been... hmm. Not... naughty.**" My breath caught, in some strange, byzantine hope. "**And yet... Not nice. No.**"

I gazed up, he gazed down. The great red figure looked me in the eye and the heat of a thousand yule logs burned within me.

"**I gift you that which you desire most. I gift you... Extinction.**"
