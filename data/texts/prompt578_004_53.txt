It’s been with me a while now, and the paranoia has certainly set in. The all too sudden change of being in one place then popping into another is both horrifying and exciting. Every now and again I keep thinking that I’ll be listening to music and maybe I’ll start subconsciously tapping on my desk or table and...poof, I’m in Zimbabwe or some other country I couldn’t find on a map if I tried. 

Although that whole idea never overshadowed the main idea; if I’m there, I’m needed. For some random unbeknownst to me reason, I’m needed. I actually haven’t used the power in a while, I’m on a bit of a vacation, or was, I guess. I reached over and put on my water proof boots. My feet fitting snugly in. I haven’t had to bust these bad boys out since that typhoon hit Japan last month. And they did nothing except weigh me down. Although here I think I may need it more.

I grab my pack and do one last check of everything. First aid kit, rechargeable batteries, heavy duty flash light. Purified water, and some energy bars. I don’t really have anything to help out a specific problem, then again I work much better doing what I can for everyone when I decide to step in.

“How long has it been since the last one?” I muttered to myself as the news station emitted it’s low volume gargled sound. “Was it that earthquake? No, maybe that wildfire in the U.S.” my mind bouncing back and forth between the disasters I went to. Only for a feeling of guilt to set in promptly after reminiscing. How many people could I have helped if I didn’t stop? Would I still be here if I didn’t take the year off? Would some families still be together? Would there be less orphans in the world?

“Whatever, it doesn’t matter now. Feel guilty when the job is done.”

I glance my shifty eyes at the tv. The hurricane hit about 10 minutes ago, I can’t delay anymore. I zip my bag shut. Give myself one more look over, good. 

“Alright, it’s now or never...let’s save some lives, me” 

I reach my hand over on my wall.

I sighed, took a deep breath.
