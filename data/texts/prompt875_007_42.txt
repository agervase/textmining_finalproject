   


I sat with my back against the door, clutching the sides of my head and hoping she wouldn’t find a way to get through.

“Daddy...let me in…” I heard her voice outside, but it wasn’t her. Not anymore. I could hear her crying now, her tiny fists pounding on the door but I couldn’t give in, she had to stay out there. It had happened when she was at school, that was probably the only reason I was still me and not like them. Things had happened so often that even the news could barely cover it before it was taken offline. The term zombie had been mentioned, so I expected mindless hordes and not this. The fact that my daughter was one of those things now killed me inside, she was all I had left after my wife passed.

“Daddy...let me in…” She repeated, and although she spoke with emotions and inflection, it was the exact same way as she’d been saying it since she got here. I could hear others, some of them repeating what she was saying now and others just crying. They had been my daughter’s friends and classmates but now they were all just monsters with their faces and voices. Her pounding and crying was becoming more insessint and despite whatever I tried to do, I could hear them increasing in volume.

“Go away…” I said, “Just go away!” I shouted now, hoping it would work. There was a pause for a moment and I thought I was safe. I stood up and looked through the peephole, and that moment was all they needed. The group of them forced their way onto the door, their combined force being greater than what I could do to stop them and soon almost a dozen former children were in my home, the only difference was that all of their eyes were now pure white, without even a sign of a pupil. It was too late for me as they surrounded me.

“Daddy...I love you…” My daughter said to me as she stood over my cowering form, I closed my eyes as they came in and then everything went white.
