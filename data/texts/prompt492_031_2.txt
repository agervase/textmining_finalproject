Earth was always a dull place. Every now and then a member of mankind dies, either by their own kind, by themselves, or by disrupting something they shouldn't have. My name is Azrael, and I together with my twin Samael, we collect those who have left Earth, and guide them to their final resting place.

When a man leaves his place on Earth, Samael would retrieve their soul, and they shall remain in a place where there is no evil, no wrongdoings, until they are forgotten by those around them. Once those around them have forgotten the man, then I shall retrieve them and place them in a final resting place where they can rest in peace after years of life.

One day however, I am told to retrieve someone from Earth. I spread my wings, and flew down. I am in a place that smelt of ashes and all I see all around me are darkness that stretch from the East to the West and the South to the North. As thunder echoes from lands far away, I could feel something tugging at my dark shroud. I looked down to see a little girl about eight years old. I crouched down and talked to her.

'Hello little girl. What's your name?'

"Raniya."

'Raniya. It's a good name. My name's Azrael. Nice to meet you.'

I reached my hands out and she shook it. My hand is almost double hers.

"What are those things on your wrists?"

'These? Well these bands are called zacharel. They mean "Reminder from God". They remind me of my duty, what I can or cannot do, what I must or mustn't do, and they protect me from any harm in the world.'

The cold wind from far away travelled to the place where I'm standing, and the ash nearby flew with it and it hit her. As she rubs the ash from her brown child eyes, her body shivers from the cold gust of air.

'Are you cold little girl?'

"Y-Yes."

'Here. Just take my shroud. They'll keep you warm.'

"Is it okay mister? But then the big rocks under your skin will fly away too."

'Oh no they won't.'

"Mister, why are you here?"

'Well, I've been wondering about that too. Why are you here?'

"I-I don't know. One day I was playing by the river far away and then I heard a really big noise from the village so I came back to the village to see my mother, but then when I am in the forest I could see black smoke, and when I got here, the village is burning. I searched every home to find my friends, my mother. No one was there. In the middle of the village I can see many big footsteps heading away from the village."

My eyes are feeling quite warm and wet while I can't help to empathise with this young girl.

'W-Why didn't you find help?'

"The nearest village is a long way mister. I haven't eaten in two days. I-I don't know where it is."

'You're hungry? Let me find you some food.'

"Really? Thank you mister!"

As I spread my wings to take some food above, one of my zacharel on my left arm is burning. I looked at it, and it said, 'No human shall witness divinity'. I thought to myself that the situation demands it, and so I ripped it. As it happened, a thunderous noise echoed throughout the Earth.

I went up, took some of the food, and dropped down. As I gave the food to her, another band in my left hand started burning. It said, 'No human shall be given divine assistance unless ordered by El'. I ripped it, and another noise echoed throughout the Earth. As she ate, I took hold of her and we flew together.

As we arrived in that vast field of green, she asked me of what this place is.

'This is a place where you'll be. You will always be fed, and you will always have friends here. You will be in peace. You will rest.'

"Is my mother here?"

'Maybe she is. You'll just have to look. Can I have the shroud back?'

"Oh here it is mister. Thank you so much."

'No, thank you.'

As I left that place and I returned to my rightful place, a voice could be heard behind me, and a bright white light surrounds me.

**Azrael my faithful. Why have you reject and defy My commands?**

'Because it's stupid. That girl was alone, she was hurting, and she was hungry! And You weren't there. I took pity for the girl. So what if I broke two of Your rules? She needed comfort, and I gave it to her.'

**That is not your decision to make. Had the girl-**

'Had the girl what? Pray? Pray and hope You'll come down? She was on the verge of dying and she needed comfort! I can't help myself to take pity on this little girl!'

**But you going past Purgatory and immediately going to Paradise is NOT your task. Your task is to take the souls in Purgatory to Paradise. How can you not follow these simple commands of Mine?**

'I'm sorry, but if I am not allowed to take pity and help the poor then maybe I'm not fit to be one of Your servants.'

I then ripped all the zacharel from my arms and legs, and I threw down my blade.

**You have broken all of My rules. You shall be punished for this.**

'Then punish me all you want. Because if You do not act regardless of what people want or desire of You then You are not fit to be ruler of the universe.'

The white light immediately disappears and an immense force pushes me down to the deepest parts of the sky. And with the white feathers of my wings burnt, all that remains is now the skeleton of it. My whole body begins to burn. My eyes now glow a hellish red instead of a warm yellow. On my right arm a writing begins to appear.

**PRINCE OF HELL.**
