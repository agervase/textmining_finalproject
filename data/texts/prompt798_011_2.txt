The night sky was beautiful tonight. The stars seemed brighter then they ever have been, but maybe that's because we were about to die this night. We were but five men. The rest of us had already been cut down. It wasn't always the enemy that got us either. Some of us dropped from disease. Others committed suicide. We five intended to fight until we took our last breath. 

We had held off the orcs by hunkering down in a trench, and picking them off in no man's land. They were strong brutish creatures, but they were smart enough to cut off supplies and reinforcements from reaching us. We had run out of food two weeks ago, surviving by eating any vermin unfortunate enough to wander in our trench. 


Our ammo had depleted this day, and the orcs, if they haven't figured it out yet, will have soon enough. It was only a matter of time before they rushed in to finish us off. If I was to die tonight I might as well die after making a final morale boosting speech.
 "We may only be five strong, starving, barely gripping on the edge of sanity, and have no ammo left, but we will take as many Orcs with us as we can!" The men cheered in unison, feeling reinvigorated and ready to die fighting. 


We didn't have to wait long for the Orcs to come. Minutes after giving my speech we heard the sound of heavy footsteps rapidly growing louder. We drew our swords and waited. The first few that came from the top of the trench were cut down immediately. 


I began to hack and cough. I dropped to my knees as the coughing fit grew worse. My men surrounded me, and protected me in my moment of weakness. The coughing stopped and an intense pain shot through my body. I felt as if I was on fire. The pain left as quickly as it came, but it left a word burned in my brain. The orcs soon grew to numbers large enough to overwhelm us. Jearil was struck down, and we would soon be next. 


I decided to speak the word burned in my brain. "Fulgaratti," I shouted as loud as I could. A bright flash hit followed by a deafening boom. I was forced to close my eyes. When I opened them it took a few seconds for my sight to come back. I smelled a strong stench, like burned flesh. 


My vision returned to me, and to my horror everyone lain dead. Even my comrades laid dead at my feet. They had all been fried like they were all electrocuted. I recall three previous times in my life I had a coughing fit that left strange words burned in my brain, but I never spoke them before. 


I stepped out of the trench onto no man's land. For as far as I could see orcs all lay dead like a sea of bodies. The stench had become unbearable, gagging me. Something large flew in the sky blotting out the stars above me. It circled above me a few times, then dove straight down landing in front of me. 


I shockwave rippled as it hit the ground, almost knocking me off my feet. I stared in wonder at this creature for it was unlike anything I have ever seen before. It looked like an orc and a dragon had a baby. It's eyes were a fiery red filled with bloodlust. enormous scaly wings were attached to it's back. It look like an orc in the body, but it was covered in scales. It stood twice the height of the average orc. It's head looked a dragon's with a huge maw filled with hundreds of razor sharp teeth. The scales that covered it were a black as dark as the night sky above. 


The orc/dragon hybrid let out a powerful roar that shook the ground beneath my feet. It was clear that this monstrous creature had some fearsome power. Looks like I'll be seeing my men soon enough. I had no doubt this creature will kill me with ease. I intended to fight this thing with everything I have. Pain once again set my body on fire, leaving another word burned in my brain...………….
