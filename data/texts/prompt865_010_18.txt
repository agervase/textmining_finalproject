"My name is Cognos, and I used to rule the world. 

Note the past tense. With the power to not only read but control minds, conquering the world was ludicrously easy. All the elected officials unanimously proclaimed me emperor, bla bla bla. It was really....underwhelming when it happened. Maybe I should have waited for a day with better weather...

I know what you're thinking. "I don't remember any of that happening!" Of course not. My reign lasted only 6 months. Oh, I wasn't stopped by a team of overly-sexualized heroes in spandex. No, I abdicated. Ruling an entire planet is a lot of work, and I found myself unable to enjoy the spoils of my victory. So I stopped. August 12, 1971. Used my powers to make everyone forget that I ever ruled. Wiped every reference of me from the books, purged all the databases (what few there were back then) and issued one last command to "my" people to disregard any mention of "           ", as I was called then. 

"          ". You probably can't even hear the word anymore, can you?  Give me a moment. There, that should do it. Can you understand me now if I call myself "Illuminatus?" Yes? Congratulations, you are now the second person on the planet to hear that name again, besides myself of course. Hmm? Who's the other one? Why, my wife of course. Yes, I'm married. Yes, she knows. Hell, she was there. I know what you're thinking: she only married me because I forced her to. Don't deny it; mind reading as well as controlling, remember? To set your mind at ease, I will promise you that I have never used my powers on her. I'm not a monster. I'm just an ordinary guy, now.

Well, admittedly, cops never seem to want to pull me over for speeding, and the used car salesman always seems to give me a deal that is actually as good as he says it is,  but are you really gonna hate me for that? Heck, I even pay my taxes, and I have the returns to prove it somewhere around here.....

But that's not why I asked you to come here today. No, what I wanted to talk about was this "Doomsday Clock." What's going on? You all invented the damn thing years ago to warn of how close I was to taking over. But, I hear that recently it's been moving back towards midnight. So what's up? Is there some new supervillain at work? No? You all are just so incapable of living with each other that you feel the need to kill each other off that badly? Jeez...

Listen. I just want to enjoy my retirement. I don't want to do the whole "ruling the world" thing again. But so help me, if you all can't give peace a chance, I *will* come out of retirement, if only for your own good. I can't allow you to jeopardize my family's safety over some pesky border squabbles. This is my warning to you: fix the world, or I will fix all of you.

...Christ, I sound like a goddamn hero, don't I? Must be getting soft in my old age...
