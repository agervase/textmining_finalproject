Today I was rudely interrupted from my slumber by the sound of metal slamming and scraping along the walls of my cave. I do not get many visitors and mostly it is either the brave and stupid, intoxicated or small humans, but luckily they are easily scared with a half-hearted roar. Sometimes people were coming with offerings, most likely expecting a favor like the idiot that tried to rip out one of my scales after bringing me some small but meaty animal. 

So I take a sniff to see what it might be this time - and it was different. I smelled blood, a lot of it. I gazed into the darkness of my entrance when I spotted one of their warriors, stumbling towards me. Blood is streaming from several wounds and he crashes into the walls, determined to reach me. Eager to understand the meaning of all that I moved towards him which caused him to fell on his knees. He was putting a bundle in front of me while mumbling something in their tongue before collapsing. Three more breaths and he was gone.

He brought me one of their newborns. From my observations I knew that this must be one of their most precious possessions. I have seen them risking everything they have to protect them from harm. So what was going on here? Since I do not understand their language, I had to figure it out myself. Why would a gravely wounded man wrestle with his death to bring their most valuable to me? Something bad must have happened to them and they want my help.

I looked at the dead fighter and replied silently: "Thank you for the sacrifice, it will not be in vain. I accept your offer and will find out how to help your people at once." With that I took the bundle, snapped its surprisingly fragile neck and swallowed it whole. I left my cave and steered towards their settlement, wondering what misery might have befallen them.
