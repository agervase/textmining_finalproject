The bench wasn't comfortable.
It was cheep plastic with steel frame, the kind that just don't let sit and relax.


The secretary called my name and as I stood up I realized my pants and shirt where probably one size too big for me, I felt uncomfortable.


As I walk towards the door, every piece of me just ache to be back home with my dog. Why did I had to come here anyway?! Why did I even had to show up for this interview?!


I go into the room and he doesn't get up, he doesn't shake my hand. In fact he doesn't say or do anything.


I sit in the only available chair.
God, I wish my dad was here with me.

"Name?"

"Alex."

"What role you think you'll best fit in, Alex?"

"None. I don't even want to be here."

"I'm sure we can find something for you"

"Can't you just send me home?"

"It doesn't work like that Alex. You seem like a bright lad, it'll be perfect for you, you'll see."

"You don't understand. I dispies this place, nothing good will come out of this."

"Through the door to the right and strait all the way."

"What if i refuse? What if it doesn't work out?"

"It will. I promise" he said with a genuine smile. "Now through the door and strait all the way, please."

As I walk the coridor my shoes squeak and my belt clicks. I feel heavy and hot, I will never get used to this feeling.

I open the door and enter an open area that looks like a parking lot.
They are all dressed the same, with the same haircut, the same heavy shoes and sad faces.

"STAND IN FORMATION!" a booming voice came from the speakers mounted on the walls. "ROWS OF THREE. FACE TO THE LEFT!"

As we're forming lines a tall figure stands infront of us.

"Get on the bus ladies! You're coming back as men!"

An old bus get into the parking lot. A hand written sign is hanging on the door: 
"BASIC TRAINING"

First promp. Sorry for the spelling, english isn't my native.
