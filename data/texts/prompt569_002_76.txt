Samogorath stepped out of his portal, already dreading his next few moments. Screams. Curses. The planet shattering boom. 

"How did you do that!" 

Even death, consumer of all and the end of everything, got startled sometime. This area was supposed to be clear of mortals. He always found it best to work where no one could watch him. 

The one who asked the question, was a rather nice looking young woman with raven black hair and ... aha. She was a witch. That explains it. 

'Move aside witch. I have no business with you'

His rumbling voice made her step back a little. Good. Samogorath thought. Maybe now i can work in peace.

'Whoa!' She said finally. 'You must have a killer audio system in that suit!' 

What the hell was she going on about? Samogorath wondered. What could he be hiding in his suit of armor rather than his own body?! How was he supposed to contain sound in a suit! This one must be a powerful creature to know of things he had no idea about. 

"ARE YOU THIS WORLDS CHAMPION!" He bellowed as he brandished his War Scythe. 

He had expected fear, anger, a challenge... instead...she looked genuinely impressed.

"Oh my god! did you make that yourself! You got to share your secret with me. I am struggling to make a good staff for months now! My costume is not complete without it..." 

Samogorath was flabbergasted. 

He stepped towards her. Menacingly. 

"Damn! She said. Your movements look so fluid... how did you hide the joints!'

Death froze in his tracks. 

"Young lady... he began

She frowned... "That's not a tone you should be taking when talking to someone you know. Its condescending." 

Samogorath stared at her. His heart... black and lifeless... gave one startled beat... What the hell ... 

"Do you know who i am? he asked. Patiently. Turning his menace down to a minimum. 

She walked around him. Almost touching the blackened folds of his wing. 

"Are you a leech king variant?" She asked. 

He turned on her so fast that she gave out a little squeak and hopped back. She was grinning however. 

"HOW DARE YOU COMPARE ME TO AN ABOMINATION!" 

'You must be really into your role, huh! She exclaimed. Relax dude... chill... this is the back stage remember. You don't need to keep up the act where our sponsors cant see us. And how do you move so fast in that costume! It must be a ton of rubber! Damn you must be ripped from all that exercise. 

Samogorath stared at her. Has humanity really forgotten the face of death?

"Do you really have no idea who i am?"

No. I really don't. Unless you are doing something from a doujin... I mean i dont want to brag but i am pretty well informed when it comes to these things... 

Amusement. He never thought he would feel that again. 

Yet... no. He could not wait anymore. This world was one of the last on his list. Once this was done, he would rest for another 1000 years. Nothing but reading the same dusty old books. The same game of chess. ... He was not too thrilled about it. Yet.. what else was there... 

He felt an arm wind around his. Strange. She should have started screaming... her flesh melting away from her bones... Yet she was... okay.. 

Look, you look like you are clueless ... is this your fist Con? 

He did not know what else to say... so he simply... nodded. 

Well then allow me to show you around! She grinned. His heart beat again. What was happening to him. 

Death... the consumer of all... found himself powerless as kept up with her. What ... was.. happening to him...

Dargorath, The Fallen Emperor, shook his head as he spied the far seer. 

He had always thought that Samo was a weak willed whelp... but to fall for a human... whats worse... the human was falling for him too... 

"What should i do?" 

"Nothing." Came a female voice. He looked up to see his wife approaching with a book in her hand. 
She was reading war and peace again. He reminded himself to get her kindle next time he visited.. oh wait... he stared at the far seer again.

 It was worse than he expected. Those two had a red string of fate connecting them now. Perhaps its for best. He smiled as he drew her close to give her a kiss. "What's that for?" She asked. Amused. "Nothing." He replied. "I just remembered how happy i am."
 
She stared at the far seer. then back at Dargorath. "How long are you going to pretend you didn't set this up?"

 Dargoraths mischievous smile was confirmation enough. Next... he would have teach his son how to share immortality.
