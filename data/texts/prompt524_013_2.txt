I have to tell the story of earth in five minuets?
But's that's the shortest increment time even gets
So I better get on flow like nobody knows
So get ready for some quickly written rhymes
In these sickly barely dentin' times
There was a big bang and with it everything came
To be and some of it formed to be a big blue planet
Not even fuckin' God could've planned it
Any better than that but there were no backwards ball hats
So onto earth some bacteria grew 
And it was fuckin' sick of drowning in water so onto earth it flew
And crawled and walked
And just when it seemed that everything was chalked
Up to be like it was right we got a gigantic rock
Thrown at us like a shot from a glock
It killed the dinosaurs and restarted life on our planet, creating these homo sapiens
Then the Greeks created minotaur's, romans told Caesar to can it, and humanity starts seeins
That we're not all the same
Some of us have a little more fame
So we went into wars fighting with catapults
All after the continents pulled apart with some faults
And yeah we all gotta few but nobody knew
What was comin' next, but there was no light so a dark age
Came across, but this was way before Dr. Dre
I'm talkin' Da Vinci's renaissance
And Michelangelo's Goliath came with no sense of nonchalance
And then everybody started learnin' the science we needed to evolve
So into war machines we went but no problems were solved
America decided to make a union of states
Guess they were sick of the Queen's tea dates
And then the French ran away, England went into a rage and America became isolated
Later known as the land mass everybody fuckin' hated
And as time marched on the only thing that changed was the ways we killed
I guess single shot rifles never really thrilled
Us enough so we created machine guns and went off to fight a great war
But the gasses left behind massive sores
So it was time to think about how war was fought
And for the lost minds we went and sought
For a cure we never came up with, talkin' PTSD
But we sent 'em back to fight for the key
To stoppin' a communist revolution
But we weren't so antipollution
So we created a bomb that could wipe out our species
Made Japan's pants see large pieces of feces 
So Japan retreated the German we defeated
But Russia was dictator leaded
So into a war as cold as ice we went
And over a million soldiers were sent
Yet not one was killed in enemy territory
While at home we were worried about a death sudden and gory
Cuba had a crisis, talkin' a few years before ISIS
But the whole world waited overnight, with tape on their eyelids
And the Russians didn't hit the button, everything was fine but still a white run country
So the blacks protested in the streets, listening to Martin's I Have A Dream speech
And the major players died, Mrs. Kennedy cried
And America showed a glimpse of it's ugly side
But Johnson proceeded the plan to give them voting rights
A long silence with even longer nights
Then one day Debbie Mathers gave the world a star born son
Who only talked about shootin' up schools with his gun
We moved into the eighties, with Cool James leading the charge
NWA was a hit and into rooms across the world mothers would barge
"What the fuck is this rap shit, it'll make you sick!"
Followed by "Fuck you mom, go suck dads dick!"
Then came the nineties with Kurt Cobain
And everybody slang cocain
Then Slim Shady came and washed everybody's brain
And did a bunch of drugs and reveled in his fame
Until he almost died, and one of his friends did
For a while Shady hid
But he came back a true Rap God
While Al-Qaeda blew up buildings with plane old bombs
Just kidding, everyone knows George Bush blew those buildings before he blew Obama
Who moved into office and promptly took out Osama
And I thought the world had finally turned around and maybe we moved out of our slump
And November 8th came around and some dumbass voted in fucking Donald Trump
And now here we are, just a planet among the stars
So please let us live on we deserve a second chance
We only want to imitate Gaga and just dance
When it comes to livable shit this planet is as good as it gets
So thanks for letting me use your five minuets
