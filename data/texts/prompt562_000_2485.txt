As it turned out, starting the apocalypse was the easy part. After a few false starts with the World Wars, I finally saw my chance in 1962, with the Cuban missile crisis. All I had to do was set off a few explosions and negotiations fell through. The subsequent missile strikes made it easy enough for me to sneak in and launch even more nuclear bombs to locations of my choosing, and by the end of the year I'd estimate 90% of the human population was dead.

The hard part was that last 10%. I went around tearing down whatever vestiges of civilization I could find, and when I couldn't find any more I figured I'd done my job and could just wait out the remaining stragglers to die out. So I waited. I waited 100 years, and tried to kill myself each and every day, but it wouldn't take. Somebody out there was still procreating and prolonging my damn life.

So I went on a world tour once again, which was pretty difficult considering I'd single-handedly shut down the world's commercial airline system but hey, I had time. I spent centuries walking the entire Earth, looking everywhere I could possibly think of for that last family that was denying me my death, but no matter where I looked I couldn't find any signs of any human life at all.

Eventually I gave up, and went back to England to lie face down on the ground and try to act as dead as I could manage. I did that for a few more centuries, and then, to my surprise, somebody found me. As soon as I processed what was happening, I leapt up and stabbed him in the heart. The man just laughed. 

“Not gonna do you much good there. See, I can’t die until I’m the last human alive, and I figure the same goes for you.”
