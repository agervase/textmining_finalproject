Hi everyone! This is my first post. I'm working on my writing, and the worst part is my stamina is bad. I'm going to continue working on this on my own. I've enjoyed reading the submissions!

"You'll be starting in the Adolescent Department. Anyone who dies before age 9 automatically goes to heaven, so anyone who dies between the ages of 10 and 20 will end up in this office. You'll mostly get car accidents, suicide, pranks gone wrong, that kind of thing. Childhood cancer also pulls quite the crowd. We like to start people off here because it's easier to argue for a kid's soul. Blame the parents, mostly..."

It took the newbie a beat to realize I had stopped talking, and he began nodding enthusiastically. "Definitely, for sure."

What was his name? I glanced down at his paperwork. Jeff.

"This way, Jeff, you're pretty much guaranteed a good win/loss record, and when you're ready, you can apply for different departments. We have departments for religious extremists, murderers, sex offenders, murderers and sex offenders, CEOs, executioners-- what, do you think they have a license to kill just because it's their job?"

"N-no, I guess I never realized..." He stopped himself. Most likely from saying something dumb. From across the wooden desk, he seemed small and insignificant. He bounced his knee nervously, caught himself, then stopped. 

"So I'm going to help get kids into heaven?" he asked slowly.

"Precisely. Unless, of course, you've made a deal with the Devil. Then you'll be helping them get into Hell."

He snorted. My expression maintained it's usual stoicism. "I- thought- I thought that was a j-joke."

"Of course not. The Devil makes several trips to our offices every week, whenever anyone who he has his eye on dies. Mostly politicians and celebrities, but he has a special taste for children, so keep your eye out! He drives a hard bargain. Anything you can dream up, the Devil has, or can get for you. That's why so many people end up working for him."

He nodded."Does anybody here work for God?"

This time, I snorted. "Please elaborate."

Panic flashed in Jeff's eyes. "I, um, you know, there's the Devil, so there's God too? Right?" 

I exhaled out my nose. "I see why you would think that, Jeff. After all, it's just your first day."
