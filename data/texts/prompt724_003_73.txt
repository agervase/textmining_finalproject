"Well, this is awkward," I stated, as Billy Joel went about Uptown Girl. I won't explain myself here, I'd set my entire music library on shuffle.

"You don't say. Uptown Girl, my word," muttered Ak, not looking up from the massive tome he held in his equally massive hands, sat on his head in the middle of the floor, crossed feet and tail curled.

"Well, give me a moment." 

I turned to get the cake from the oven, pulling my glove on. I'd only bought a small amount of mix, and looks like I was going to have to share.

"So... I guess I'm here for the cake?" Ak shut the book, looking up with a toothy grin.

I turned around, cake pan held in one hand, the other on my waist, and decided to lose it a little. "The cake? This cake, you mean?"

"Well, I'm assuming. Is there more?" he asked, rubbing his hands together in anticipation.

"Well, sure, I guess we can share this cake, this absolutely pathetic little piece of-"

"Okay, I'm sensing that you're a little upset today..."

"- fuckING CAKE ONCE YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF! WE HAD AN AGREEMENT! NO FUCKING WEEKENDS OVER! DO YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS? IT'S SUNDAY-"

"Yes, Sunday, I know, I know..."

"AND THAT'S PART OF THE WEEKEND, HERE IN THIS REALM! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN YOUR SHITTY UNDERWEAR REALM, BUT HERE, IT'S STILL THE FUCKING WEEKEND, YOU ASSHAT!"

"Okay, I get it, let me expl-" He made to get on his feet, but I'd lost it by then.

"OH, PLEASE DO! PLEASE DO FUCKING EXPLAIN! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I NEED NOW! YOU REASONING YOUR WAY OUT OF THE UTTERLY STUPID THOUGHTS THAT MAKE YOU FUCK MY LIFE OVER FOR THREE STEADY DAYS BECAUSE YOU HAD A FUCKING CRAVING FOR FUCKING CHOCOLATE FUCKING CAKE!"

"Could you calm down a bit though, I mean-"

"OH, AND WHY IN HELL WOULD I DO THAT? WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE? WHY TODAY? WHY RIGHT NOW? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK-"

"Look at the cake-"

"I WOULD LOVE TO, YOU KNOW, ABSOLUTELY, INSTEAD OF HAVING TO STARE AT YOUR FUCKING UPTURNED MUG RIGHT NOW-"

"LOOK AT THE CAKE, MAN!" Hellfire spurted out Ak's nose, staining the floor. I decided to look at the cake, went ahead with that decision, and promptly lost my voice.

"Er..." I managed, as he looked at me smugly. I looked at the cake. And back at him. And back at the cake. And repeated that for perhaps a full minute, trying to find words. 

"Well," he asked, "can I have some? Bit famished today."

"So you're telling me..." I still had a bit of trouble believing it.

"Yes?"

"You're telling me that Uptown Girl..."

"Which happens to be my jam, I'll let you know."

"So Uptown Girl, which is your jam-"

"A veritable classic, I assure you."

"- and the logo of the Silmarillion-"

"My friends haven't read it yet, so I have it all to myself."

"THAT'S ALL IT TAKES TO GET YOU HERE?"

"Well, I'm here right now, so, I guess?" He shrugged. While still upside down.

I looked back at the cake. The logo was still okay. It smelled as nice as it could've. The music had changed to a piano solo I'd ripped off YouTube. I have no idea why that came to focus. I snapped back to reality, set the cake pan down, and reached for a couple of plates and a knife.

"Fetch a chair and pay attention, because we-" I started, as he flipped onto his feet and stretched, "are going to have a nice, long chat about pop culture."

"That sounds *interesting,*" he mimicked Death Note's Ryuk as he headed to the living room, looking for a chair. "Where do we begin?"

I hopped onto the counter, reaching for the Nutella bottle nearby. It was gonna be a long night. Ak returned, carrying my spare recliner on his back like some massive Greek punishment.

"Memes," I replied.
