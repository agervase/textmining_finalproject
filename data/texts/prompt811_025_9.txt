"Being a DCR-7 has its advantages. My own parking spot, close to the office is a real devil-send. (You think public transit is bad in ***your*** plane of existence?) I get 4 weeks PTO every year to visit anywhere off the restricted list, and my discount at Prada is downright sinful. 

As long as this doesn't screw things up, Dark Lord willing, it'll be just a few millenia until I'll be invited into the 8th circle, working directly under the big man himself. Ah, there's nothing more a guy like me could wish for really. This place takes wishing right out of you. That's the thing about hell, it's not much different from other planes, but the **feel** of the place is insidiously one of lack. 

Here, try to understand it this way: Imagine how it feels having a holiday dinner surrounded by your family and friends. A fire's on, the kettle's boiling, Kenny G plays softly in the background as the earthy smell of roasted vegetables mingles with the scent of honeyed rolls and old wine. 

Now imagine the opposite of that. 

It's like hope is a seed that doesn't grow here. Your dreams, your sense of wonder, you just lose interest in keeping them alive. Hell, the way some people act on certain planes you would think they already live here.

Anyway, the office is shaped like a giant summoning circle. I'm told it has something to do with theomancy being a sympho-... sympa-something magic but I think it's because our Beezlebuddy has a weakness for presentation. Either way I'm just the call guy, you'll have to talk with I.T. about what makes this thing run.

But you're here because you want to know what happened. I show up in the Good Book, hell forbid, for one blip of a moment and suddenly there's an Angelic inquisition. Lucky for both of us all summons are recorded for quality assurance, so why don't we just roll the tape so I can get back to answering calls, and you can get back to ... Belial knows what you guys do over there, singing and praying probably."

SUMMONING ALERT FOR: ARNOLD WORMWOOD 

PLANE:  MALKUTH

"Fuck". 

SECTOR: NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES

"Double-Fuck". I sipped my steaming hot cocoa at my desk waiting for the rest of what was sure to be a real crap fiesta. Earth always was.

LOCAL TIME: 11:28 PM EST

SUMMONER:  GWEN WATERHOUSE

Oh for hell's sake, another Waterhouse. The last guy that went out for a Waterhouse ended up on paid sick leave for a month, but, well, he was just a DCR-5.

SUMMONER CLASS: LEVEL 1

I chuckled. I couldn't help it. Level 1 was what they trained the new recruits on. These are very basic first time summoners with Ouija boards and idiotic questions like "Who will I marry?". 99% of the time you didn't even need to materialize to fulfill the pact! But then, "Things going Pear-Shaped, thy name is Waterhouse".

With a martyred sigh I set down my mug and began to chant, a little unenthusiastically at first if I'm honest: "**I Cool the Fires**" my office began to blur and my desk light flickered "**I Keep the Pact**" my eyes started to glow a bloody red "**I Hear the Names**" cold iron shackles snaked around each of my legs and encircled my wrists "**Abaddon, Kali, Sekhmet, Dagon I drink from your chalice**" my body disintegrated into shadow and the room shook "**Great Leviathan, I Answer the Call**".

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I shoot through an endless darkness, a black shadow in the dark sky of a planet without a sun. My chains rattle noiselessly behind me and the powers of Hell fly with me.
