*Stephen Hawking was once asked, “If you could go back in time and ask Sir Isaac Newton one question, what would it be?”. His reply surprised (and perhaps disappointed) many in the audience.* 

*”What happens when a star dies,” he said. Of course, we already had the answer to that question. But what seemed like a wasted opportunity, was actually an incredibly clever maneuver by Hawking.*

*You see, at the time of his death, Isaac Newton was working on that very topic. He hadn’t thought to consider the death of a star until late into his life. In essence, Hawking was buying him more time. What could a mind like Newton’s have done with an extra decade or two? What new questions might he have pondered that no one else could have ever thought to ask...*

“It’s just not normal, Kate. A boy his age should be playing baseball, running around outside, riding bikes,” Jack said. 

Kate crossed her arms worriedly. “He’s *different*, Jack, I know that. But you don’t have to be  so hard on him.” 

Vincent scribbled wildly in his coloring book. He paid no mind to the lines, instead scrawling Fibonacci sequences wildly wherever there was space left. 

He could hear every word of what Jack and Kate were saying in hushed whispers. Vincent supposed they were his parents biologically speaking, but it was hard to think of them that way...

Jack sighed and exited the kitchen in a huff. He entered the living room where Vincent sat, “Hey Vince, what do you say bud. Wanna have a catch outside with your old man? It’s a beautiful day for it.” 

“That’s alright, Jack,” Vincent answered cooly, “I’m perfectly happy indoors. And frankly, I’ll never understand the doltish masses and their peculiar obsession with *balls*.”

Jack frowned. “Doltish masses? Peculiar obs...Where does a seven year old boy even learn to use words like that?”

Vincent hesitated, “uh...tv?”

Jack said nothing. His face was blank, but in his eyes Kate could see he was hurt. “My whole life I dreamed about having a son. I didn’t never go to some fancy college or nothing, but I worked hard to ensure that one day, when I did have a kid of my own, I could give him a better life than what I had growing up. I just...I never thought he’d be so...*alien*....to me. I- I’m sorry I’m such a failure to you, son.” 

With that, he turned and walked away. 

*Glad that’s over with,* Vincent thought, *I’ve been given a second chance to complete my work, I will NOT squander it on petty annoyances...*

Kate crept up behind him and tapped him lightly on the shoulder. “Your father loves you more than anything in the world. You know that, right Vince?”

Vincent bit his lip impatiently, “Okay...”

Kate looked to the stairway where Jack had gone up. “It would mean a-lot to him if you told him that you loved him too...”

Vincent rolled his eyes and went back to work in his coloring book, “Okay, maybe after dinn-.”

“No,” Kate said, “Right now.” She reached down and took his book out of his hands.

“HEY give that-“

“You’ll get it back when you do what I’ve asked you to.”

“Ugh.....*fine*, Kate. Fine.” *No use wasting time, the woman could be stubborn as an ox.*

Vincent made his way up the wooden staircase. Midway up he heard a noise. *Laughing?*

*No.*

*Is he....could he be?*

Through the closed bedroom door Vincent could hear Jack’s muffled weeping. Hearing the man’s anguished crys, something inside Vincent began to crack...

*Perhaps,* he thought, *Perhaps I failed in my previous life because of how I managed to push everyone away. My siblings, my friends, even Joanne...*

“Perhaps I was given a second chance *not* to complete my life’s work,” he whispered, “but to have a second chance to *love*, and to *be* loved.”

He stalked up the remaining steps and pushed open the bedroom door quietly. “*Dad*,” he said, “How about you teach me how to throw a baseball. I’ve been...I’ve been meaning to learn.”
