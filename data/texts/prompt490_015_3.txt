*The characters and events mentioned are not mine, but the narrative here is.*

"Pavlova!" I exclaimed, picking her up. "You know we don't play with sword-wielding rodents!" As I chastised my bell-collared cat, I thought back to the strange events almost two years ago. "Hans," I holler into the kitchen. "Pavlova found another mouse soldier. Looks pretty beat up."

"You should get Fritz to bring his toy soldiers and battle those mice," Hans replied, distracted. Because of his shyness, I was one of very few people who could discern that in his voice, but his humor was well known.

Ever since two Christmases ago, I could never stand to eat pies or cakes, or anything with icing. They made me feel terribly sad, so Hans, who I'd begun dating that following spring, would make all sorts of candies and confections with various nuts.

I walked into the kitchen, put Pavlova down near her food and water tray, and rummaged in the recycling bin for a box to extradite the vermin with. Just as I found one, Hans called me over.

"Clara," he beckoned, "try this."

I let him put the confection in my mouth and proceeded to ask him what it was.

"Jalape√±o pecan brittle. I hear it's popular in Texas."

The sweet, nutty flavors carried with them a bold heat and the sassy flavor of the imported peppers. I had wondered what was in that box from Mexico City.

"I love it!" I wasn't aware I liked this sorta thing, since German food doesn't employ spicyness quite this way, but I felt like I could step outside and melt the snow around me just by standing there. I kissed Hans on the nose with a mouthful of the hot, nutty goodness.

"I thought you might," Hans said with a smile, and went back to finishing up his work.

I went back to where I had seen the mouse. 

It was gone.  It left the sword.
