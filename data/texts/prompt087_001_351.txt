“Hey Jim, how’s it going?”

I approach my neighbor with a wide grin on my face. Jim no doubt thinks I’m just being polite, but the real reason why I’m smiling is because I have $120 of his money in my wallet, and he has no idea.

Jim scratches his head as he sees me approach. “Actually, something weird happened last night.”

“Oh,” I raise my eyebrows with exaggerated surprise. “What happened, buddy? Was it bad?”

“Well… Yes and no. Do you remember how the neighborhood kids broke my front window playing baseball a few weeks ago?”

I smile, because there’s no way I could have possibly forgotten. I used the broken window as my point of entry into Jim’s house last night. “Yeah, I remember.”

“Well, I woke up this morning, and it was just fixed.”

“It was?!” I open my mouth wide and clasp my hands to the sides of my head.

“Yeah.” Jim shrugs. “I have no idea how it happened. I had been meaning to schedule an appointment, but I just kind of put it off, you know? And this morning, out of the blue, it was just fixed. But that’s not even the weirdest part.”

“No?” My heart is racing in anticipation of his mention of the robbery. As much as I enjoy the actual burglaries I commit, hiding in plain sight is the most exhilarating part of my profession.

“So I’m looking at the window, and I smell something funny on the carpet.”

“Oh…” My delight instantly gives way to fear as I stuff my bandaged hand into my coat pocket. “Was it blood?”

“What!? No. Why would it be blood?”

“Uh, no reason…” The smile returns to my face. “Go on.”

“It smelled like… soap. I inspected it a little further, and I realized that someone cleaned and vacuumed my entire living room carpet. Like, they moved my furniture to clean under it and everything. And then they reorganized it all in a way that, quite frankly, I really like. It’s like a professional repairman slash cleaning crew slash interior designer broke into my house while I was asleep, and I didn’t realize.”

“Oh…” I have to say I’m a little disappointed by the direction of our conversation. There was too much blood on the broken window and carpet for me to leave behind. The repairs and cleaning were solely about not leaving evidence at the scene of the crime. And I honestly hadn’t given a second thought to the way I reorganized the furniture. “It sounds to me like you got robbed.”

Jim actually has the nerve to laugh at the suggestion. “Are you kidding? I mean, I’m concerned that someone was in my house while I was asleep, but this is kind of amazing. This mysterious person saved me hours of work, and hundreds of dollars. I spilled a glass of wine on my carpet last week, and thought I was going to have to pay a professional service to get the stain out. This morning, though…” He shakes his head and smiles. “You’re going to think I’m crazy, but I think it was The Sparkler.”

“The Sparkler?”

Jim’s eyes grow wide. “You haven’t heard of The Sparkler? He’s like Santa Clause, but real. He’s been fixing up people’s houses in the dead of night for weeks.”

“Oh…” The timeline Jim is laying out perfectly matches my crime spree, but he must be referring to someone else. I’m performing cold, calculated robberies, and am certainly not helping people. “How so?”

“Well, I know he visited the Jenkins family, four houses down. They woke up one morning and had a brand new front door. I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but it’s really nice. I think it’s mahogany or something. And their old front door was a piece of shit. It might as well have been Styrofoam.”

“Well…” I wince as my injured hand balls into a tight fist in my pocket. “Maybe the burglar performed extensive reconnaissance, and knew how flimsy the Jenkins’ door was. Maybe he chopped through it with his axe, and stole Mrs. Jenkins’ diamond earrings. And then maybe he removed the pieces of the old door so there wouldn’t be any evidence of the crime, and replaced it so that the Jenkins’ wouldn’t get suspicious.”

“Yeah, maybe.” Jim doesn't look convinced.

“And another thing. We probably shouldn’t call this guy ‘The Sparkler’. To me he sounds like a real unpredictable, loose cannon type. Maybe we should go with something like ‘The One Man Wrecking Machine’.”

“Sure,” Jim says, shrugging. “You can call him whatever you want. I’m just glad he’s out there, making the world a better place.” Jim closes his eyes and smiles. “Well anyway, I’m dipping into the $500 I had set aside for a new window, and hitting the links for 18 holes of relaxation. I’ll buy if you want to join.”

“No thanks,” I say sadly, pulling my bandaged hand out of my pocket. “I cut myself last night.”

“Oh,” Jim looks at me suspiciously. “How’d you do that?”

My mind is flooded by a sudden panic. I had not been expecting that question. “Uh… Shaving?”

“Hmm…” Jim furrows his brow and stares at me for a long time, before nodding. “Ok. I hope it heals soon. Maybe The Sparkler will stitch it up for you tonight.”

“You mean The One Man Wrecking Machine?”

“Sure.” Jim smiles and waves. “I’ll see you later, buddy.”

“Hit ‘em well,” I call, as I watch him walk away. A small smile forms on my lips as he enters his house. I can’t believe he bought it.
