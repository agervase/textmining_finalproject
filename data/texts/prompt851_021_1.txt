*snap* *snap* "wake up buddy, it's show time". I picked myself up, pushing myself off the cold steel floor, I was in a prison cell? The walls were steel, bolted together in mismatched pieces, like it was made from scrap metal. There was a gate made of jagged, sharp looking rusted bars. "Where am I? What's going on?" "You're dead buddy, good luck". The cell shifted, the gate opened and I was dropped out, about 10 feet onto hard ground. I spit sand and clay out of my mouth and gathered myself. I was barely on my knees when I was hit, hard in the side by something big. It knocked the wind out of me, I looked up at the dust cloud and saw the beast circling me. I picked myself up and ran, desperately gasping for breath. I hit something with my foot and tripped, faceplanting in the dirt. I looked behind and saw a rusted, jagged pipe, jutting out of the ground. I quickly grabbed the pipe and yanked upward with all my might. The pipe was stubborn, but slowly gave way and snapped off. I dug it into the dirt and pointed it at the beast. As it approached I noticed something oddly familiar.... the mandibles... the exoskeleton... the head... a beetle? I remembered the small gap in its hard carapace right behind the head area. I aimed the pipe and braced myself for impact. The pipe hit its mark, skewering the insect and stopping him in his tracks. I had just noticed the loud cries of the crowd, shouting and celebrating my victory. I raised my hands and smiled, then something large came into contact with my head and turned the world black. I awoke in the same cage, this time a man with a halo and bright white robe stared into the container. "Good morning, and good work. That was one of the creatures you killed in your lifetime. You've got..... 143,822 more to go. Good luck buddy. A word of advice, the ants are stronger than they look, but you already know that. Also, I really hope you aren't afraid of spiders..."
