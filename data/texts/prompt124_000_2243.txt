"Look, buddy, I'm going to make this clear." I lean back in my recliner. Gloria giggles, and huddles closer to my chest. I resist the urge to sneeze, as her antenna tickle my nostrils.

"You made me immortal, right? Eternal youth, no qualifiers or gotchas."

"Except one," rumbles Him of Smoke and Flame.

"Except one," I acknowledge. "Thing is, science was a lot less advanced back then, and the only people who knew how the world was going to end were fire gods like yourself. So you figured, "boy, wouldn't it be funny if I made it so this smug mortal prick spent an eternity burning in the depths of the sun, unless he retracted his wish and granted me my freedom?"

This time, he grins. obsidian teeth clink against each other in a parody of happiness. Millions of light years away, I talk to his projection in real time. "You're making a mistake son. This is your very last chance to free me, before I expire along with this planet. Because you were right-- I knew all along how this world--" and here, his rocky tentacles make an expansive motion, indicating he means 'world' in a more universal sense "--was going to end. Do you want to know how? Because, I promise, it will be an infinitely longer torture than the wait for the sun to burn itself out."

I grin right back, and quote my favorite, eons-dead poet right back at him.

    Some say the world will end in fire,
    Some say in ice.    

I trail off, and for the first time, the god looks disconcerted.

"But your mistake was in thinking the world would end at all. You gave me Immortality. *Eternal* youth. I am a source of infinite energy, and infinite negentropy. When the rest of the universe becomes cold and dead, I will supply the power for the entire remainder of civilization. You were one god among many on an insignificant world in an insignificant galaxy. But in the end, I will be the only god left in the universe, and the kernel from which it begins anew in my image."
