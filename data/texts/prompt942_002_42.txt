It took two months before the news coming from the westernmost points of the continent reached the rugged villages of the Eurasian steppe. Throughout Europe, the word spread among kingdoms and empires, republics and fiefdoms, that portuguese fishing boats, on their usual routes in the north Atlantic, had found a large fleet advancing eastward, its sails unlike any the old fishermen had ever seen. After a few days of scant fishing and plenty watching, the sight of familiar desert islands in the ocean, many leagues from the coast of Portugal, welcomed the landing of that fleet, where it remained until the fishermen returned home to dock their loads and give news of the strange ships they had found in the treacherous ocean waters.

At once, the Catholic Kings of Portugal and Spain, Lords of the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, assembled their armadas, expecting an assault on the spice trade monopoly they had long established by unscrupulous mercenaries, pirates and corsairs at the pay of France and England, or the devious Dutchmen, those envious nations of Europe which had failed to set sail for India under the dangerous capes of Africa. Perhaps even Venice and Florence, or the Arab kingdoms of North Africa, resenting their lost influence in the profitable trade routes from the Orient, sought to defeat the power of a unified Iberia. But that assault never came, and the mercantile ships went and returned undisturbed, bringing the powdered gold of the Indies to the welcoming ports of Lisbon and Barcelona.

Soon, as the schools of fish escaped their nets to the safety of rocky cliffs and volcanic beach surfs, the God-fearing men at sea dared to approach the islands, league by league, until the encampments were visible to the eye and the strange cries and prayers of these peoples grew louder in their ears and frightening in their hearts. As the tales of mystical sailors from beyond the ocean, with gold ships and blood sails, spread around the courts and squares, aristocracy and bourgeoisie of Europe, an emissary ship was established, with ambassadors from historical alliances among the crewmen, representing old and proud nations, as well as, at the insistence of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, a priest and an acolyte, to convert these godless men, as they had done in the scalding costs of Africa and the humid jungles of south Asia. With the finest navigators of the ages at the helm, the brightest politicians on the decks, and the greediest merchants following their wake, the mission left Lisbon on the eve of the holy Day of All Saints' on the year of our Lord 1755, reaching their destination within half a day, with the blessing of strong winds and a quiet sea.

Among the dark coasts of the archipelago there were few vacant beaches, and no bays without large golden ships anchored in their waters. The mission could only send small rowing boats to reach the landing sites and the encampments beyond without risking a shipwreck. So many were the crewmen wishing to visit the peculiar folk which had taken these islands that it had grown dark by the time the last of the boats had been pulled to land by the trained hands of the sailors. And it was by the fading moonlight that the mission finally reached the main camp they had heard of by way of the Old Sea Dogs which told their tales in brothels and ale houses alike along Mediterranean ports. The golden reflection of a large stone structure greeted the Europeans, who marveled at the precious metals covering every foot and every inch of the grand temple. In the short months in which they had arrived and settled, these peoples had already erected a pyramidal site of prayer, which large stairs covering one of the sides, which strange men and women, wearing colourful robes, now faced, oblivious to the delegation which peered at them from the shadows, witnessing their exotic prayers, as the flickering lights of nearby fires warmed the mystical scene with orange flames. The European emissaries, hypnotised by the powerful orations, stared in amazement until a few decided to retreat to the beaches and, under the dark night sky, sleep for a few hours and face these incredibly wealthy foreigners on the morrow. Their golden ships and gold temples promised a lucrative venture ahead, starting at dawn.

But dawn brought with it an untold sorrow, unprecedented and unpredictable. As the priest and his acolyte, aided by the most religious of the crewmen, organised the morning's makeshift mass for All Saints' Day, hoping for the grace of God in the holy day to guide them in their encounter with these othergodly men, God sent a message which would resonate in Europe for decades to come. The trembling volcanic grounds awoke those still asleep and sent crashing the stacked religious ornaments prepared for mass, giving notice of the strongest earthquake to hit western Europe in history. Lisbon, capital city of the powerful Portuguese Empire, would lay in ruins within only a few hours, but the mission would not hear of it anytime soon. As any seafaring captain knew, earthquakes were a most destructive force on land, but they caused an even more powerful wave of unstoppable sea, and the three-dozen-strong mission quickly gathered their belongings, climbing the steep hills away from the coast and into the woods, closer to the foreign encampment, in time to witness the tide retreat to sea, only to come back in the form of a wall of water which ripped through every ship in every bay, cracking hulls and masts and smashing wood and gold against the rocks with a deafening roar, as if God Himself was speaking through its work to them. And the mission heard the words that He spoke.

God told them they were alone, that they were unable to escape, stuck on that island with the strange people they had come to meet.

*Let us move, then,* thought the priest, *and see to these otherworldly people, strange in custom and spirit, that the Good Lord called upon us to meet.*
