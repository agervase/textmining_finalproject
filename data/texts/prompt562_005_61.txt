# An Antihero's Succubus (Part 1)

This was my last hope. I had been searching for any means to start the apocalypse for over two hundred years now. When the witch had cursed me with immortality over a thousand years ago, I had thought it was a blessing. But what I hadn’t known then was that she was actually using me as a vessel.

I was only immortal because she was immortal.

And having her inside of me was annoying as hell. Especially since she stirred every other decade, bringing me almost to the point of becoming psychotic from her inability to keep her damn mouth shut.

Or thoughts, I guess, since she didn’t have a mouth.

“What in the hell are you doing?” She sneered inside my mind.

“Why even bother asking?” I asked out loud. “You already know I’m trying to summon a demon.”

“Damn fool! It’ll never work. Just pass me on already if you want to die so badly.”

I had thought about that actually. Passing her on to someone else.

But the problem was, she didn’t just want to just destroy humanity. She wanted to end the world entirely. To destroy all life in existence.

So I figured just killing all people was the lesser of the two evils. I found it ironic that I was a hero in a way. Saving life by taking it from humanity.

But the truth was, the immortal witch really did have the power destroy all life, so long as she was in the right kind of vessel – the vessel of a god.

Thankfully, it turned out I was only half a god. A demigod. Which meant, she really screwed herself over trying to possess me in exchange for immortality. And here I had just thought I was a normal medieval villager back then.

Poor wench.

Having drawn out the ridiculously complicated hexagram – yeah, that’s right witch, it’s a *hexagram*, NOT a pentagram – that ought to teach you to mess with a demigod – I sat down to read out the inscriptions in the old tome I had secured.

It was encouraging to see black electricity begin to erupt from the symbol on the floor as I carefully recited the words, using my demigod magic to provide the fuel to produce the spell.

Unexpectedly, the spell exploded, sending me flying back against the wall. I coughed from the impact, but of course no blood came up. Immortals didn’t bleed – at least not my kind of immortal.

I quickly waved my hand in front of my face, trying to clear the air in front of me so I could see if the summon had worked.

Something moved in the unnatural darkness, and glee stirred in my chest.

Yes! It worked!

I had summoned the most lethal demon known to mankind, capable of doing what some of the most bloodthirsty demons were incapable of – causing the apocalypse.

As the darkness lessened, the magic fading, I finally laid eyes on the creature that would destroy humanity.

The succubus gave me a confused look, before a grin slowly crept on her face when she realized she was in the human world now.

“The jobs simple,” I explained to the succubus sitting before me. She was naked of course, having just been summoned, and exceptionally voluptuous in every way that mattered. “You just need to sleep with every human, killing them all off one by one. And you’ll have to work fast, because they reproduce like rabbits.” I then stuck my thumb at myself. “And once you’re done with all of them, it will finally be my turn.”

The succubus unexpectedly crossed her arms underneath her chest, hoisting it up provocatively. “And why should I do that?” She asked haughtily.

I stared at her in disbelief. “Umm, because you’re a succubus? It’s what you do.”

She *humphed*. “I’m only half succubus. My father was a vampire, so if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather just kill people the old fashioned way.”

“Oh,” I said in surprise. “Well, yeah. Sure, that’s even better, I guess.” Although, the problem with that was that there was only so much killing would do. There were humans, usually mages, witches, and others who could defend against a vampire, as well as most demons. Only a succubus could off those types with her seductive wiles.

“Pervert.” She sneered.

“Wait, what?” I exclaimed. “Why are you calling me a pervert?”

She stared at me seductively. “You *want* me to sleep with all humans before I sleep with you. Sounds like a pervert to me!”

I scoffed at her. “No!” I didn’t know what else to say though. How do you tell another person, demon or otherwise, that the only way you can die is if everyone else does first? Plus, for all I knew, this succubus might side with the witch if she knew her plans. I had to keep my mouth shut and pretend like I was the true villain here. Not the antihero that I actually was.

She was just staring at me, waiting for me to continue. I didn’t realize I actually wasn’t looking at her eyes though. I was looking down. I quickly cleared my throat and glanced away. “Whatever. I don’t care how you do it. Just kill them all. That’s all that matters to me.”

“That’s more like it,” she replied haughtily. “So let me tell you how this is going to go. You work for me, not the other way around. When I say ‘jump,’ you say ‘how high.’ Got it?”

I stared at her disbelief. Was she serious? “But I summoned *you*! That’s not how this works!”

She raised one of her thin eyebrows in response. “Wanna bet?”

# Part 3

Apparently, she assumed my sudden silence was a challenge, because she abruptly got up and walked right over. I stared up at her naked body, completely shocked that she wasn’t even trying to hide anything. But then again, why should I be surprised? She was a succubus after all. Or at least half-succubus.

As she stood over me arrogantly like a queen might over her subjects, I got a good look at her golden eyes framed by her black hair. They were truly beautiful…and mesmerizing.

I abruptly blinked and looked away. “Seriously?! Don’t even try that shit with me!”

I noticed her posture abruptly change in the corner of my eye. She was alarmed that I had resisted her. “W-What are you?” She asked hesitantly.

“A demigod, of course. I wouldn’t have risked summoning you if I were a normal human.” I glared back up at her. “I’m not an idiot! So, use your hypnosis on some else!”

She abruptly crossed her arms underneath her chest and *humphed* again. “I’ll do what I want, thank you!”

“Oh please,” I scoffed. “Stop being difficult and just do your job already. The clock’s ticking!”

Her brow abruptly furrowed. “What’s a…clock?”

Oh right. They probably didn’t have those in her world. “Never mind. Just go start killing people. I don’t care how you do it. Just get the job done.”

Despite my demands, I expected her to continue arguing pointlessly. However, she didn't. Instead, she fell silent for a few moments.

She then abruptly yawned, stretching her arms high above her head, revealing everything she had right in front of me. “Nah, I think I’ll take a nap first.”

I was about to retort, but she abruptly dropped down on her heels and climbed into my lap faster than I could respond. My back was instantly forced back against the wall as she made herself comfortable, resting her head against my chest.

“What are you a cat?!” I exclaimed.

“Me-ow!” She said cheerfully. I just glared at her. She sighed then, snuggling her head against me while closing her beautiful golden eyes and making herself even more comfortable.

Damn, this wasn’t going as planned.

"Umm, excuse me. Are you being serious right now?"

She huffed, keeping her eyes closed. "Oh, just shut up and take a nap. My magic is tied to yours, since you summoned me, and you've used most of it up getting me here. So I need *you* to replenish it."

Well...she did have a point.

I sighed, leaning my head against the wall and closing my eyes. She abruptly cleared her throat, causing me to look down at her again. "What?" I snapped.

"Excuse me? You better change your attitude buddy!"

I sighed, not feeling like arguing anymore. I really was drained. "Can I help you?" I tried to say pleasantly.

Her eyes narrowed. "Better, but still needs work. Anyway, you're forgetting something."

"And what is that?" I asked, attempting to keep my tone level.

"Your arms? You have a naked succubus sitting in your lap and you're not going to hold me?"

She had another good point, but I was too annoyed. "I'll pass."

She abruptly stuck out her bottom lip and pouted. "But I'm cold."

Dammit!

"Fine," I snapped, wrapping my arms around her.

Liar, she was super warm. Granted, maybe it was like running a fever where someone felt cold *because* they were so warm. Not that I had been sick in over a thousand years.

Unexpectedly, she abruptly purred just like a freaking cat, and snuggled against my chest again.

Dammit, what I had I gotten myself into?
