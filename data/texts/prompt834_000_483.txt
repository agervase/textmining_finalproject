Heather's eyes popped open. She pressed a finger to her forehead, saying a silent spell to ease her migraine. Her dreams were always accompanied by an aura, and yesterday night's left her feeling like a freezing hand had crawled up her back while she was sleeping. She bit her lip. It definitely wasn't a good sign. 

&nbsp; 

The corridors were eerily empty. Halls that should have been filled with students were devoid of a single living soul. Heather clutched her book bag closer to her chest. What was happening? 

"Hello?" Her voice echoed through the halls. Her soft-soled boots were nearly silent on the tile floor, but she couldn't help the feeling that she was being watched. "Abigail? Cory?" She called out her best friends' names, but there was no reply. It was a bad idea coming to school today. She should've stayed in the dorms. Maybe she had missed a memo about a break or something. 

"Over here!" A voice hissed. She whipped around to see Cory's blonde hair poking out from around a door. "Quickly!" 

Heather dashed towards the classroom. Cory dragged her to the back and pulled her down so they were kneeling behind a line of desks. "What's going on?" she whispered. 

"There's a Vexspawn in the building. Everyone's in hiding. Of course you would be late." He tapped her on the forehead a little harder than was necessary.  

Her eyes widened. "Vexspawn?" Her voice rose. 

He brought a finger to her lips desperately, his gaze whipping about. Then he nodded. 

"Wait, but how did a Vexspawn get in here? I thought they usually frequented woods." They had learned about the creatures in their biology classes, but she'd never thought they'd actually encounter one. Vexspawns were terrifying creatures, not because they had a grotesque body in and of themselves, but because they could take on different forms. Shapeshifters. And no one really knew how to deal with them because their sightings were quite rare. She pulled a dagger out of her boot. 

"What are you doing?" Cory asked, looking at her strangely. He eyed the dagger warily.

She shook her head. She didn't know either. She'd done it subconsciously. Her father had taught her how to use dagger when she was younger, and although she hadn't had much need for them after learning magic, she always kept one in each boot. Just in case. 

A scream sounded, echoing through the hallway. Heather leapt to her feet, but Cory dragged at her arm.

"We can't just do nothing," she said. "We have to go help out!" 

"The teachers will take care of it. We just need to stay safe," Cory hissed.

"Heather!" 

Heather froze. Was that...that was Cory's voice. She blinked. But Cory was right next to her. 

"Heather!" the voice called out again. She looked down at Cory, who was sitting there wide-eyed, staring at her. 'Vexspawn,' he mouthed. She let him drag her down, more reactively than of her own will. She couldn't hear anything over her heart pounding in her throat. 

Then a shadow appeared in the doorway. And even with the window blinds closed, with the small amount of light streaming through, she could see him clearly enough through the desk legs she was hiding under. She swallowed. 

It was Cory. And he was staring not at her, but at the Cory standing next to her.
