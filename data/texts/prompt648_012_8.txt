The farmer was expecting something, but not like this. 


&nbsp;


The temple had been built simply, only with what was on the property--stone, felled lumber, hay that was woven with care and patience as the roof. *It's not much, I know,* the farmer had thought as the last stone fell into place, *but it's all I have, and it was made with love.* It was night by the time the farmer made it across the field and returned home; the children were already nestled in the family bed, and the farmer lay down beside them, falling into a deep, restful sleep.


&nbsp;


The Mother arrived during the night. Her existence had long been prophesied, but there was no concrete proof of her existence beyond the wailings of her children. Great temples, glittering with gold and swirling with incense, had been erected in her honour in all the great cities, but she never came. *Our Mother has left us!* the gods in the pantheon had cried from their temples of marble and precious stone. *We've made a mistake! We never should have come! You trapped us with your temples, and now she's forsaken us!* The gods were convinced their Mother had abandoned them as punishment for their foolhardiness and earthly desires, and ceased to give out their divine blessings. 


&nbsp;


The farmer and the children knew nothing of the gods refusal to continue serving their role. The farm was in a far flung corner, away from the cities, away from the cries of the gods and the humans who served them, and it took days to travel from the farm to the closest settlement. Out here, there was only silence, and an endless horizon of stars, and space as far as the eye could see in which ones thoughts could run. 


&nbsp;


*There's something in the temple! There's something in the temple!* The children shouted the morning after she arrived, but when the farmer joined them, there was no one to be seen. 


&nbsp;


*I swear there was someone here, just a second ago.* The girl cried. *I'm not lying! I promise!*


&nbsp;


The farmer crouched down, brushed the hair out of her eyes, wiped her tears. *I know you're not. Tell you what, the cow's need to be milked. Why don't you and your brother go tend to them, bring some of the milk for our guest in our best bowl, add some honey to it?*


&nbsp;



The girl ran off, excited to play host.


&nbsp;



After that day, the children would wake up and immediately ask what they should take to their guest, and the farmer would think of the best they could offer. On the second day, it was some of the finest herbs from the garden. The next, the most beautiful egg from their finest chicken. The day after that, it was the first shoot from their crops, dug up with care and replanted to the side of the temple's door.


&nbsp;


Those days came to an end on the fifth morning. 


&nbsp;



The farmer awoke to a harsh pounding at the door, the sound of a mob outside. The children cowered under the quilt, sewn roughly from the pelts of so many vermin. The farmer wanted to take a moment to calm them before turning to the door, but it was too late--the mob broke in, livid, angry men and women, a sea of beautifully coloured fabric and shiny accessories and perfect facades that concealed their loathing for each other and the shallowness of their piety. One grabbed the farmer by the neck, screaming, spitting, demanding to know what the farmer had done that none of them could do. *We gave them everything they could have wanted! What could you and your dirty family have to offer that we haven't given them in spades?!*


&nbsp;



The farmer, though barley able to breathe through the mans' chokehold, croaked a reply. *I gave them everything I had to give! I gave it honestly! Please, I don't even know what's happening!*


&nbsp;



The man scoffed, then repeated the farmer's words to the mob in a mocking tone. The mob dragged the farmer outside, trampling the new crops, frightening the animals, until they threw the farmer to the ground outside the temple that had only become occupied days before. 


&nbsp;



The farmer looked up from the ground and saw a soft, unearthly light. They had all come. The gods of health, love, war, intellect, craft, of life, of death, were all there, kneeling before the farmer's temple. 


&nbsp;



*Come.* said a soft voice from within the building. 


&nbsp;



The farmer looked around and realized no one else had been called. But the gods knew. They glowered as the farmer took hesitant steps towards the temple, wove through them on the way to the entrance. 


&nbsp;



*Look inside. Look at me.*


&nbsp;



The farmer went closer, expecting to see nothing, but opened the door to find a woman--was it a woman?--many headed, many armed, but beautiful in her ferocity and glowing brightly from some inner light that came from no fixed point, taking up the entire space inside. 


&nbsp;



*Do you know who I am?* she asked from all of her mouths, but with only one voice. 


&nbsp;



*I--I don't.*


&nbsp;



*Why did you erect this temple?*


&nbsp;



*I wanted to see who would come. I've always been a believer, I--*


&nbsp;



*You lie.* she interrupted, disappointment in her voice and flickering across her faces. *Your intentions were different. I want to hear you say them.*


&nbsp;



The farmer swallowed hard before speaking. *It's for my children. I cannot take them to the temples to pray. I cannot leave the farm that long, the animals would die without my help. I made the temple to see who would come, to give my children a chance, a connection with something bigger than this.*


&nbsp;



*Why did you not adorn it in a manner befitting the gods?*


&nbsp;



*I thought did. It's the best of all I have. The very best! It's the finest roof I could weave from my finest crop, my finest masonry, the lumber from my finest trees. I spent years selecting it all.*


&nbsp;



*Where's the jewels? The precious metal? The fine perfumes and silk?* she snarled.


&nbsp;



*I'm sorry. It's all I have.* 


&nbsp;



She stared at the farmer, silent, contemplating, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, she spoke again.


&nbsp;



*You mean this all, earnestly?*


&nbsp;



*Yes.*


&nbsp;



*And there's no secret in your heart? I will know it if you are lying. I will kill you were you stand.*


&nbsp;



*No, nothing, there's nothing.*


&nbsp;



*You lie again, but I know you know what it means to be a god. We are not to ask. We are not to take. We are to give, to make things better. The humans pray to us, and we are only to help those who are honest in their worship. Don't you agree?* Leaning, close, she whispered *This is your last chance, human. No more lies.*


&nbsp;



The farmer stammered, suddenly aware of the gods surrounding the temple, sensed the tension that flowed between them, saw their silent but expectant looks, and became embarrassed by what was about to be said. *Yes. I agree. It's why I only wanted my children to pray at a temple out here--I knew only an honest god would be willing to come this far.* 


&nbsp;



*Do you think they were right, my children, to be bribed so easily by trinkets so worthless?*


&nbsp;



Another loaded question. The farmer glanced at the gods surrounding the temple, all staring now, their faces placid but for the hint of a snarl, of a threat, were the farmer to misspeak and betray them. But the farmer would not be intimidated.


&nbsp;



*...no. They were not right. It's why I stopped believing in them.*


&nbsp;



*..then it is done. They are worthless.*


&nbsp;



She stepped out into the sun, slowly stretching to her full height, tall, taller than the farmer had ever imagined possible. She gave one last look at her children, then felled them all with a wave of her hand, split them in half, their golden blood spilling to the ground. The mob retreated, screaming and disgusted as the torsos of their deities crawled across the ground towards them, begging for help. 


&nbsp;



The farmer turned to face her, shocked and uncertain of what would happen now. 


&nbsp;



*Any last words?* She asked.


&nbsp;



*My children. Please. Spare them.* The farmer begged without hesitation.


&nbsp;



*This is truly your last wish? You do not wish to save your own life?*


&nbsp;



*Yes, it is. Please, spare them. My life is meaningless without them, anyways.*


&nbsp;



The Mother began to shrink, until she stood as tall as the farmer. *Those gods, my children,* she said, *they were not my own. I gave birth to them, but they were born fully formed. I was merely a conduit by which they arrived in this world, and I was unable to change their hearts. They were not children worthy of my attention or worthy of their title.*


&nbsp;



The farmer's children ran across the field, the blood of the gods sticking to their toes, splattering up their legs, but they didn't notice. They ran to the side of the farmer and cried *Please! Please, don't hurt us! Don't hurt our family! We did everything we could, we gave you the best, the farmer made sure we did!* 


&nbsp;


The Mother smiled. *Don't worry, littles ones. I know how hard you've all worked.* She smiled, held out her hands. In them appeared cups, full of shimmering, ethereal liquid. She held them out to the farmer and the children. 


&nbsp;


*What's this for?* The farmer asked. 


&nbsp;


*To transform each of you,* She said, smiling, *and to celebrate. A toast, to you, and to us, and to the creation of our new pantheon.*


&nbsp;


The farmer and the children took the cups, and, with one final reassuring glance from the Mother, each took a sip.
