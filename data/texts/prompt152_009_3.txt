Personal take:


I don't think... Price of life...forever...Many hundred years passed...what if? Go back? Must press button...send back... 5 October 2018.

_____________________________________________________________

Sounds of the gyroscope whirrs to a halt, and I open my eyes. 

Wow. I've not opened my eyes this widely in decades. My vision's so clear now. I'm actually 24 again. 

Ever since I invented time travel, my relationship with time became wonky. I continued to age, but became unable to die. Doomed to age endlessly. In fact, the last thought I had earlier in this story was, what would be the prequel, had been the only thought I have had in months. My mind had become fragmented from all the multiple lifetimes of existence. The bright side is I also revert to the age I was at a time period. This also means I can't go to eras before I was born.

Oh yeah, I'm gonna phrase things like I'm writing a story. Because discovering time travel changes the way you think. 

Sorry, I digress. Who am I talking to? Actually, myself. Ignore that, I'm just excited to be this capable once again.


What am I back here for?

Oh right. Where it all began. 5 October 2018. In 1 day, I will shake hands with my best friend on inventing time travel. That's where my hellhole began. I won't invent time travel again. Never put myself through eternal life again. It's torture.


I need to kill myself. But not myself. Myself that roots to myself now, myself in the future. I need to create a paradox. That'll erase the timeline where I invented time.


I need to go home.

I need to kill myself. To erase a timeline.

_____________________________________________________________

The plan is to acquire a gun, make sure I can't ever think or invent again. Fastest method to kill is straight to the head with a gun. Good thing I have one at this age. That's what I'll do. Go home, take gun, kill self, end suffering. Easy.

I get back home. Mum's leaving for work. Mum. I miss her, haven't seen her in a while. But I can't touch her. If I do, the paradox will be created too early. No no. It must be precise.

I open the door and hear:
"You're back so soon?"

Good thing mum's in the kitchen. Makes things less complicated. I call out to her:

"Hey mum; forgot something. Gopal's gift. His birthday's soon, so I thought I'd get him a present in advance."

She mumbles something back from the kitchen. 

Gun.

Gun.

Right. It's in the shoebox in the cupboard. Good thing paradoxes only happen if I touch living things. Dead things experience time forever, just like me. 

Funny thing you should know. People are 0-dimensions on time. Which is why inventing time travel did not give me eternal youth, although it gave me eternal life. Because we should only experience time in a straight line. That's also why I reverted to 24 years of age.

There. Gun.

I can't touch anyone for a few hours, where should I go? I know. The junkyard. It's a shortcut on the way to where I once worked. Only I used it. Also, no one goes in there unless it's Wednesday.

I grab a bag. I'll need a change of clothes too. For the blood. After this, it's gonna be a short 10-hour wait at the junkyard. Short because, I've waited way longer. Too much longer. 10-hours to end all my suffering is a small price to pay.

_____________________________________________________________

Okay. 6am. Sun's rising. I'll kill myself on the way to work. Once I kill myself, I won't be able to invent time travel. I'll have ended all my suffering. Or anyone else's, I hope.



More waiting.


There he is. I mean, there I am. 6.24am as usual. Good thing I liked being punctual. This will be easy. Hardly anyone passes by at this time. Only me. Always on time. So much I became a part of time.


Trivial.


*Gunshot*


Now I remember this. Good. Time is changing. I pick up myself and dump my body in the junkyard. 

With fresh clothes on, I make my way to work.

"Woah, Sarav. Later than usual today? That's not like you."

Gopal is right, and wrong. Schrodinger's Gopal? That's amusing.

I smile a bit, and converse with Gopal, trying to remember what I said back when it was now. 

I look at my watch. We will say it soon. 3 more minutes.

"...just imagine if..."

1 more.

"Hey. If any of us invents time travel, we should come back and let the other know, alright?"

There it is. I pretend to think for 2 seconds.

I reach my hand out for the shake. Finally, I will be free. The paradox will set me free, since human life hates temporal paradoxes. It will destroy me.


As I shake Gopal's hands, I feel a warmth I've not felt in the 27 hours I've been in this time. It's almost comforting. Something feels weird. Is time going to claim me back now? Am I going to die like they did in that 1 Marvel movie with the snap?


In the background I see a gyroscope whirr into existence. A hand pops out with a gun, and pulls the trigger. Some of Gopal's head splatters onto me. Through his exploded head, I see...Gopal.


Wait, what the fuck.
