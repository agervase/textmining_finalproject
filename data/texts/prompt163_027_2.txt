Ah welcome my friends to another "teens in the wild" im your fabulous Aussie host morison gulover, and what we see here in front of us is the young sophmourus teenidae trying to court his female counterpart the juinos teenidae, now tensions are high for the little teeny bopper, what could mean passing on his genes or dying out, as hes a rare breed, an 5'0 sophmourus who's already hit puberty. Some may say this puts him at an disadvantage but it can be useful to pity talk his targets into thinking he's weaker and at the right moment he shows off his gains, lets see if it works shall we?

The male approachs the female, puts on a nice dance but oh! He fumbles, the juinos doesnt seem to mind.the sophmourus then starts some small talk, rookie move, small talk for a species of his caliber will only make getting a yes less likely and it's evident with the females disinterested facial expressions. The male then pops the question "will you go to the prom with me" (a side note, prom for these species is a potential mass breeding event, simaler to salmon only it happens once or twice in a teeny boppers life span so theres no option for failure) the female pauses, she thinks about her options, the male anxiously red in the face, and her answer finallu comes "sorry but im going with chad, he asked me two weeks ago, if you asked earlier I wouldve said yes" devasted the male realizes his mistake, he was too cautious and shouldve taken action before a rival male took his chance "maybe next year sophmourus"

There would not be a next year for our poor male however, as chad had impregnated our female and she had leave school to take care of the offspring. Maybe another time my short teeny bopper maybe another time. This has been your fabulous aussie host morrison gullover signing out
