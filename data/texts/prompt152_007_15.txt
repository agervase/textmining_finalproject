***June 14th, 1943; Dresden Germany*** 

I've come back to this night, physically, mentally, and spiritually so many times that one could say it is the true birth of my existence and the person I am today. I think of what brought us here; me an American born doctor and war surgeon thrust into the midst of one of the bloodiest and most desolate experiences in mankind's history, and my dear friend Frank, a begrudged German soldier and one who would become one of the finest minds in all of the world. I don't think I ever expressed to him how much I valued his mind, not just for its uniqueness but also his simple-mindedness and singular focus. He was quite honestly the type of man I'd seen through and through in the military in my years of service and had grown to despise, except for the fact that he fought a battle none would dare take up, and even I didn't think he could win. He had a certain charisma to him that drew in even his most profuse doubters and, in time, made them his most fervent supporters. I was no different. He had the most prolific green eyes that were fixated with the possibilities of the future, and harbored just enough sadness to remind you on certain occasion that he too was a child of war and hardship, and that his life was marred with the kind of struggle that makes a man's spirit go numb. Often times his thoughts would turn somber and his voice would choke with sorrow and regret, but only when we spoke of the past; he was very much a man focused on correcting the faults of today to prepare for tomorrow. Me, however, I've always had an unhealthy obsession with the past and I've toiled with mine for the majority of my lifetime so when Frank spoke of the possibility of changing it; and with it our future's it was my heart that believed him first.

I still remember the creation of our first workbench, just feet away from the bed that we shared because we could ill afford separate rooms and hardly the bed we scrounged up money for in the first place. That in it's own was an accomplishment. We had slept on the floor for some time in a seemingly endless pit of schematics and shriveled up papers and equipment that we had begged and bargained with various city factories to part with various shoddy equipment they were willing to part with. Frank gambled all night with a construction maintenance worker for several nails that we could use for the workbench, and when he was woozy from the alcohol that Frank had shared, he took his hammer too. After a few hours, when we finished constructing our first official work area complete with wood Frank compiled through some of his string of hard bargains and gambling runs, we sat and began to speak of the future; our future. It was there that we got drunk off of the cheapest liquor Germany had to offer, and pronounced wildly for the first time, that not only would we travel the world, but through time and space itself. When I asked Frank to what time he'd like to go first, he pronounced wildly 

"To the year 3000!" as he swallowed the last swig of the bottle, chuckling giddily to himself and turning and pointing the bottle toward me 

"And you?" he asked inquisitively, posturing up against the wall and waiting quietly for my answer while smiling. 

"I don't know," I started, 

"Perhaps to Old Egypt or the day the constitution was written. Maybe even my childhood to see my mother again..." I said as I trailed off, the liquor swirling inside me giving me all kinds of memories and making me more contemplative. 

"Doting on the past again William? Interesting timestamps but I'm far more interested in creating our own," he said before yawning and nodding off into sleep. I watched him descend to slumber and continually slink until his head lay perfectly in the notch against the workbench and the wooden floor before I fell asleep myself.

It's these days that were the happiest and most fulfilling of my lifetime, working and living with Frank, learning how to forget the problems of my past and move toward the future. And it's those two years that bring me continuously to this night. The perpetual swirling of emotions and memories, successes and failures, all thrashing about in my head and pouring down into the crevices of my soul. These parts of me are alive and well, so much so that I step in and out of each memory like a door from one room to another only to be confronted by my reality. Alone, in a room not a centimeter bigger than the one I'd shared with Frank. Bruised and tattered I stammer to my feet and grab a small schematic off my work-table as I begin the meticulous process of bending time. One that I nearly perfected with Frank. As I'm thrust into a small portal the size of an apartment door, I find myself standing over some shriveled up schematics in a dimly lit room in East Germany. I remember the night perfectly and for a second I slip through an additional door in my mind and into the memory.

It was a major breakthrough, and after a year of meticulous research we'd garnered the attention of a major scientific body called Nessich, which housed hubs in over 20 countries worldwide and wanted to invite Frank and I to join their developmental team with more access to materials, research and information than we'd come across in our whole entire lives. I was on the verge of tears as he told me the news and I looked into his emerald green eyes.

"We've finally done it William," he said with a huge grin etched onto his face and placing one hand on my shoulder before engaging in a full on hug. 

"Frank... this is wonderful," I said as I clenched back tears and mustered up my best smile. I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. When I had first met him he was on the verge of death, without a penny to his name and not a person who'd attest to his life had he passed. I was captive to a native country, thrust from home without family, fortune or will to survive, and we'd made a future for ourselves. It was the single happiest moment of my life. 

&#x200B;

"When we make it William, promise to come back to this treasured moment," Frank said as he looked at me with a determination and a softness all at once, and I nodded my head, agreed and shook his hand as heartily as I did with any member of the US military. 

&#x200B;

And then I opened my eyes and stepped through the door once more. I let a singular tear fall from my scarred cheek, and I let loose a bullet which buried itself right between Frank's eyes and I watched his body go limp. I watched how my happiness turned to agony, and its effect was double. I felt the wound a million times and I felt another part of my soul break loose. It wasn't the first, or the last time I'd be here again.
