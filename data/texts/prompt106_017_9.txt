"Oh, it's you again." His cold words managed to chill the freezing winter room.

I jumped. He always managed to sneak in at moments I least expected. I loved him for it.

He wasn't much of a talker, so I usually started the conversations. "So, how are things at work?" I asked.

He sighed. "Why must you always ask the same questions? I always give the same answers."

"I love how it makes you," I teased.

"How do you manage to be so insufferable," he replied. I could tell he was serious.

"Same answer," I said. I let the silence sit for a moment. "So, what do you think of this one?"

He gazed across the mangled bits I left for him, hardly identifiable. I stared too, but he read things I couldn't even comprehend.

"Well," he said, "I have to admit, it looks quite... Complicated." He turned to me, black mist spewing from his gleaming boney face. Lifeless, expressionless, emotionless eye sockets belittled me. I was under his power, and all it took was a look. How incredible. "But must I remind you, again, that I find no joy in taking the beautiful lives of these people. Why must you?"

Slowly, I responded. "Because my life only has beauty with you in it." I hated to be so honest, but he had the power to make me.

And with a few simple words, his power doubled.

"That, my dear, is my curse." He waved his sythe with a gleam, and in an instant, he was gone. 

Cleanup was always the worst part, but this time, it was different. As I placed the mangled pieces into bags, a pattern of cuts on an arm that weren't there before caught my eye. I held up the arm, and fell to the floor, a flurry of mixed emotions filling me. The pattern rang in my ear, as if death himself we're screaming it.

"In a month, maybe more, I will be at your door. I promise."
