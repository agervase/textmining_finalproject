Aaliyah hitched her shorts, purse tucked beneath her arm, carefully making her way over the rough gravel roads. A beautiful raced past, with a gaping sunroof and windows glinting in the sunlight. A magnificent beast stood arched on the hood. Aaliyah sighed; sometimes she dreamed of that. She was but a simple girl, attending public school. 

She was sixteen, and likely only had two more years of education - most of her standing only learned until eighteen, at which time they gained employment toiling for the rich. Her father worked in a caryard, and her mother in a grocery store. Her father’s caryard stood not far from the grand gates to the wealthy neighbourhoods of town, lined with tall trees that changed with the seasons. They would go on to university at the very least, with graduate school and a guarantee of master’s being more likely. Then they would inherit the companies of the world. It was just the way it was. 

On the televisual communications devices, they saw the powerful and mighty argue over nuclear weapons, and if and when they should be deployed. She knew nobody who had encountered one, for she was not of the world, living in a simple town. Aaliyah had never left her state, and believed in one God. She had been assigned female at birth and continued to present that way into adulthood, ignorant of any other way. 

She paused outside The Apple Store, gazing into the window. These devices were large and clunky, with a large button, sometimes outstretching one’s hands. But Aaliyah had only known these primitive communications for her entire life. Nevertheless, she could not dawdle - for her brother’s birth anniversary was approaching, and she had sworn to buy him nikes. It was a solemn oath, and she would not revoke it. On she continued to the nikes realm.
