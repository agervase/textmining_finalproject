Life, Alex had learned, can throw some funny things at you.

Sometimes, that funny thing happens to be an interdimensional Dark Lord.

"But what use could *you* possibly have for me?" Alex asked in a whiny voice.

"**You will address me as Xernog,**" the God boomed. He had taken the shape of a shadow with glowing eyes because, as Xernog himself had explained, his true form would literally obliterate Alex's mind. Yeah, Alex was a bit apprehensive at that, too. "**As for your use, the prophecies have long foretold your birth.**"

Alex stepped back. As the son of a powerful noble, his sleeping chambers were fairly large, but right now they didn't seem large enough.

"Look, I'm not who you think I am," Alex objected. "I'm just a weakling who lives off his parents' wealth... ask anyone!" He added under his breath: "Can't believe mom would do this to me."

"XERNOG," said another voice - or rather, multitude of voices. "THE SINGULARITY WAS ALREADY PROMISED TO THE HIVE. BY THE SINGULARITY'S MALE QUEEN."

Okay, Alex corrected himself, life can throw some funny things at you, but this joke was starting to go over his head. Behind the shadow now stood an insectoid creature, constantly shifting in shape.

"Look, I don't know what this 'prophecy' entails," Alex said hurriedly, "But there must be some mistake-"

"**You will rule the multiverse,**" said Xernog, turning to the insectoid thing. "**Hivemind. I should have known. I suppose we must battle.**"

"WE ARE A MATCH, DARK GOD. THE HIVE IS CHANNELED IN THIS ONE FORM. BUT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. A FIGHT WOULD LEAVE US BOTH WEAK."

"Yeah, let's not do anything rash," Alex pleaded quickly. "I like the way my chamber looks right now-"

"**I do not fear weakness,**" the Dark God growled. **Work together? Your surrender to common consciousness sickens me.**"

"IN PLURALITY LIES STRENGTH."

"**No.**" The shadow had no mouth, but Alex could *feel* its grin. "**It just means I can get to all of you at once.**"

Alex dove for cover as two trans-universal entities clashed in his chamber. The battle spanned aeons, on a multidimensional scale, seconds in Alex's eyes. 

The shadow stood victorious, fainter than before, panting.

**Now,**" gowled Xernog. "**Come, slave. We will-**"

Without hesitation, Alex plunged the abyssal blade, which he had been hiding, into the Dark God's exposed back.

"Yes," Alex hissed as he felt the power drain into his blade, then louder, "Yes! This feeling... so this is what father talked about!"

The shadow wheezed, as its essence was sucked from all corners of the multiverse, absorbed straight through the blade in the young boy's heart. "**...what?**"

"Rule number one from Sun Tzu's Art of War," Alex sneered, the weak facade gone. "Feign weakness when outmatched." He grinned now. "I am the promised ruler of this multiverse, *Xernog*. I've known since I was five. And you... are merely a stepping stone."

The Dark God wailed as his final strength died. Once he was gone, Alex stood aglow with new power. He turned, facing the empty fireplace. "So you were watching, were you?"

His parents both unraveled their invisibility.

"That's my boy," said his dad, a muscular man smiling broadly underneath his tyrant's crown. "We raised him well, Leanore."

Leanore inclined her head. "We always planned to have them fight it out, son," she said with a thin smile. "But we had to test you. You understand."

Alex toyed with his abyssal blade, twirling it between his fingers. "Of course. True power is taken, not given."

His parents looked at each other, evil incarnate and proud of it.

"I taught him that," his mother said.

"That's why I married you, Leanore," the king said, pulling her close for a passionate kiss. Alex merely snorted, instead searching the extents of his new powers. Oh, he'd have fun with this, once he'd found some proper peasants to toy with.

Life, after all, was a game, a joke.

And Alex intended to be the punchline.
