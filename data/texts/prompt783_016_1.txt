Brian quickly shook his head, both physically and mentally, he got caught up again daydreaming. He had to remain focused; his and his buddies life may depend on it. Sure, this is his 50th patrol in damn near as many days on ground in Afghanistan, with not a single incident; one that resulted in permanent injuries anyway.

Brian's team took all the required precautions, varied routes, varying departure times, pre and post recon, etc. But although 49 successful patrols is great, he still had another 7 months in country.  Making it home alive was everyone's goal, but in Brian's case is wasn't for any kids or wife (he had neither), but for his dreams; he wanted to take the money he earned in this sh!thole (not the country nor most of it's people but rather the sh!tty situation) and start his own off-grid homestead somewhere in God's country TN.  Brian loved thinking about how he would draw up plans for rain harvesting, heirloom gardening, and of course the cool stuff like home defense etc. Damn!, Brian thought, there I go again daydr....pop!...B O O M ! ! ! ! 

Thoughts instinctively went to threat assessment.  Brian knew this was a roadside bomb targeting his foot patrol, but will there be a full on assault as well? Brian knew he had not taken the full brunt of the blast because he saw Mark, not really a friend but a colleague, virtually evaporate into a chunky red mist just ahead of him.  The blast did, however, knock him to the ground and it wasn't until Brian tried to push himself back up to engage any potential assaulting enemy that he realized, that right fore arm was not only painful as Hell, but it was also lieing on the ground in front of him.
