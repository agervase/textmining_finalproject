I am as scared now as I have ever been. The sound of shrapnel banging against the exterior of my Roadster doesn't help. I need to breathe...

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." I do not scoff this time. Behind me a hollow boom sends me deeper in to the embrace of my leather seat. I don't have the courage to look back and confirm what my ears and the pit in my stomach are telling me. 

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." It just keeps repeating every five or so seconds. I manage a look at the speedometer and see that I am well below the limit. 

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." I'm going to need to figure out what is going on. I look to my right just in time to see a police officer with lights blazing tearing it down the highway, his car passing a mere foot to my right. I glimpse his face before its flashes out of view and read the expression on it.

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." The police cruiser explodes not a moment later. The officer died with a look of panic on his face. What the heck was going on. I need to escape this nightmare. I see an exit to my right and signal my intentions. 

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." I've been conditioned after only a few repetitions to close my eyes when I hear those loud speakers. This time no sound follows. I attempt to engage the exit but the Roadster begins to accelerate. This can't be how I go?

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced." Nothing again. I'm desperate now. My car is almost at the limit. 

I scream desperately, "Auto-Car Emergency Stop!" 

Nothing. My foot stomps in vain on a break that will not respond.

"Disengage Self-Drive!" 

The needle hits the speed limit.

"Attention civilians. From now on the speed limit will be vigorously enforced."
