John headed out for the weekend at the camp. This was the first time he was going out to the camp alone. Jane had passed away just before christmas which hit the family hard, how could the love of his life be gone now. How was this trip going to appease things. Everyone said it would be good so he decided to do it alone. He wasn't sure what he would find at the camp but has going to try to work things out one way or another. The Drive was hard with nobody to talk to but the radio was good enough company he started to play over in his mind the tasks he had to accomplish for opening the camp that year. Then like a knife he remembered the revolver. It was there, he had a sinking feeling in his stomach. He pulled over the car and sat in the seat thinking about it and trying to banish the thought to the back of his mind. He was confident he would just ignore where it was until he opened the camp and saw the letter. 

His wife had left him a note

Dear John

I know this trip is probably going to be hard on you but do it for me. I am always here with you. Enjoy what time you have left for all of us have such little time. 

Love always
Jane

He almost tripped as he ran for the back closet. Everything was a blur he ripped every box he could down. until finally he found it. The Colt .45. He held the cold steel and the grim reality settling in his mind. "I will be with you soon". He blindly reached into the shoe box where the bullets where. His hand met nothing. He grabbed the box with desperation. His only explanation was 

"Where!!!!"

Then he noticed some animals had gotten into the camp and ransacked the closet. The bullets were gone. He sat down and poured himself a drink as a squirrel chattered in the distance.
