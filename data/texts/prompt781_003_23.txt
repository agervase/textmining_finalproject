"Have you found Jesus?" the man in black asked.

My face contorted. *Being Human for Dummies* said this was rage.

"No, I haven't!" I spat. "Why would I be here if I'd found Jesus?"

I guess he wasn't expecting me to shout. I didn't mean to, I was just having trouble modulating the analog vocal synthesiser these primates used to communicate. He crossed his legs, protecting the thin tube of flesh in his groin that circulated his bodily fluids. I suspected he was hiding something.

"It might be a silly question, but what makes you want to *find* him?"

"I want the reward."

He nodded. "Yes, everybody wants that reward. But we have to *work* for it; we have to *earn* it."

*Is this asshole telling me how to do my job?* I wondered. Maybe he *also* wanted the reward.

"Jesus says that he is like the good shepherd, who when having lost one of his flock, leaves all of them to go find it."

I stood up out of my chair with enough force to knock it over. How could he know that I'd been trained by the man himself? That I'd left the flock and had to flee for my life centuries before I became a bounty hunter?

He wasn't in it for the money; he was *working* for the bastard!

"He's watching, isn't he?" I asked.

"Jesus is always watching," he replied, glancing at the toppled chair. "Is there something you wish he didn't see?"

*He knows about the weapon,* I thought.

"Can you send him a message?"

He frowned. "Why don't you tell him yourself?"

*He's here?!*

"Just tell him... tell him I'm not afraid. I know what I have to do, and I'll be back. With more."

I spun on my heel and ran out the door. I had no idea how far the surveillance drones extended, possibly all over the planet. He'd done that before. He'd turned entire planets into his little death traps.

So I hid against the door. If he was in that room, I'd hear it. If he wasn't...

"Frank!" called a woman's voice. "Don't send the newbies preaching! You'll get into trouble again!"
