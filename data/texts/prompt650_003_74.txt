*"Stark to Vision, do you copy? I repeat, Stark to Vision, do you copy?"*

"This is Steve Rogers, five by five."

*"Where's Vision?"*

"Where's Vision? Where are *you*? Vision's getting his stone removed, we're defending Wakanda right now!"

*"There's no time! Thanos is coming your way, tell Vision to execute Farewell protocol!"*

"Thanos? Wait, where are you? What's Farewell protocol? Stark? Stark!"

"Shuri. It's okay, you could stop working." Vision stood up from the operating table, forcing the attached equipment to shut down.

"What are you doing? This is our only chance--"

"Change of plans. From now on this is beyond our clearance level." The air rippled where he stood, the vibranium frame of the room focused the energy from his infinity stone to form a circular portal phasing through the closest adjacent timelines of two universes.

"Doctor Gears." Vision beckoned towards the stone-faced man in the other side of the portal. "We need your help."

"I guess you do." Charles Gears pressed a button on his computer, and a squad of MTF Lambda-12 secured Vision.

-*-

"So this Thanos entity, he is after the stone in your head?"

"Yes. He must not acquire the Mind Stone, doctor."

"But why?"

"Because he has made it clear that he would use it to wipe--"

"Half of the universe, yes, but that's *your* universe's problem. We simply has no stake in all this. We will contain you, yes, but if and when this entity come to our universe, our universe will take higher priority in our decision." Junior Researcher Julia Andrew was about to tick an entry on her list when an emergency message appeared on her tablet.

> Emergency Broadcast P-XK-0889. Satellite imaging indicates GOC asset movement on southern Greenland. Xyank-Glass Spatial Monitor confirmed a Class-D Trans-Universal conduit forming at the location. All Foundation personnel to be alert for potential evacuation.

"Evacuation? Evacuation to where? It's all the way on Greenland, why would they--"

"He is coming, isn't he? He has five infinity stones on his person. We need to act fast, doctor."

"I'm taking over." A woman with indistinct feature entered the interrogation room. "Alicia Gears. Level 5, O5-13 representative. You may stay, Miss Andrew."

Perplexed, Julia stood up, letting Alicia sit across from Vision. "Tell me about this, Thanos, entity, Vision. What could he do?"

"At this point it might be more productive to list off what he *couldn't* do, Miss Gears. He has the ability to control all energy in the universe, as well as freely controlling space and time. His control over what constitute reality is unprecedented and unparalleled."

"The big purple guy just annihilated a [GOC Orange](http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-tale-sequence-uhec) squad. Not unit, a squad of state-of-the-art mechanical combat units, supported by an airship sporting thaumaturgic railguns and directed fusion cannons. What *is* he?" A hologram appeared over the table, showing the path of destruction left by the Mad Titan. An entire peninsula disappeared from Greenland's southern edge, while a series of craters followed Thanos' wake through Canada. Several markers labeled as wreckage of GOC's White and Orange assets also appears on the globe, dwarfed by the information on the primary object.

"As I have mentioned, he commanded five infinity stones. Even outside his native universe he could draw the power into this universe through the infinity stones."

"I suppose using Temporal Sinks would be counterproductive in this situation."

"Not only it might not affect him at all, if it *does* it would drain our universe, which is less desirable outcome."

"How do you think he found this universe's coordinate specifically? He must be following you, right? He can't be randomly entering the [Bloom](http://www.scp-wiki.net/incident-zero-part-2) hoping to find you."

"The Bloom?"

"Nevermind. The point is, if we trap him somewhere and sever his connection to his universe--"

"Which is impossible. It would entail replacing his every particle with native particles from the target universe. In and of itself it is ridiculously complex procedure, but the infinity stones are unique quantum particles magnified into classical scale. There's no way to replicate nor replace them."

"The only other method I know of is to collide this universe with another universe, which entails the sacrifice of at least one universe, a sacrifice neither of us want to make." Alicia sighed. "This is getting nowhere. We have less than an hour before Thanos reaches our location. We need idea fast..."

"I'm of belief that the gauntlet where he attached the stones is a necessary component in regulating and controlling them. If we could analyze the structure--"

"We don't have the method to do that remotely." A green web appeared on the hologram projection, labeled as Scranton-Ruthford Reality Stabilization Network. A massive gap on the network surrounded the Mad Titan. A blue plane icon labeled "Omega-7 Asset A" creeped ever so slowly towards the epicenter of that gap.

"The device was designed to harness and regulate the power of infinity stones, including the one in my head. I could shoot an energy beam to probe the inner working of the gauntlet--"

"And how would we use this information, assuming we could acquire it without he capturing you?"

"I could output it in a format readable by your machines. As to how you will use it, is it not your specialty to understand and contain anomalous threat?"

"This is too reckless. We don't have any assets that could hold him off. Even the GOC lasted only minutes against him. The information would be useless if we don't--wait." The plane icon on the holographic globe finally stopped moving, its label replaced by "[Asset Able](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076) Engaging".

"Do you think you could forcibly transport him to another universe given address, Vision?" Alicia interacted with the holographic display, entering multiple identification for Level 5 access.

"If you could prevent him from using his gauntlet for fifteen seconds, and if I'm close enough, perhaps. But removing him to another universe wouldn't be enough, he already in another universe and yet he is capable--"

"This is Universe [Kappa-Erikesh](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317). We would have to transport you to Area-179 to access it, but that's not a problem for you, is it?"

The blue label turned red, the text transformed into "Asset Able Down".

"We must move quickly, Miss Gears." Vision urged.

"You're right. O5-13, emergency override of Foundation Asset designated SCP-2317 and SRN-888." Two point of the Scranton-Ruthford network turned red in color, as the reality shifted around the three of them, transporting them into the coordinates of Area-179.

"Alicia Gears, Level 5, O5-13 representative. The O5 command has requested full evac of this area." Alicia extended her right hand to Julia, who immediately surrendered her tablet. "It won't take him long to change his trajectory to this site. Come, Vision. You go evacuate too, Andrew."

-*-

Opening a door below a set of stairs and hermetic doors, Vision and Alicia were greeted by a salt flats with pillars in the distance. "What on Earth..."

"It's not on Earth, Vision. Welcome to Kappa-Erikesh. Can you get the coordinate?"

"I...yes, yes I have the coordinate."

"Good, we have ten minutes before he plowed through the US and reach us. We still need something to stop him using his stones. Do you think a nuke would stagger him at all?"

"It won't tickle him, I'm afraid. You would know better."

"Then I think we have to pull out the big guns. We'll give you time, so you hijack his gauntlet and send him right here in the salt world. Any question?"

"How would this world hold him, really?"

"Oh it's not about this world, but what's in it." Alicia again entered her credential on the tablet. "O5-13 emergency override, Foundation Asset [SCP-2117](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2117). Authorize emergency activation of Seventh Scarlet Chain ritual, using the casualty of intrusion of Entity Green-99-019 *Thanos* as sacrifice."

The purple-skinned Titan hardly had time to blink as numerous beams of mixed electromagnetic, thaumic, and aetheric energy rained down from space just as he reached the location of Mind Stone. This universe has so far provided him with far more diverse fight than the one he came from, but Fate is finally in his grasp, and no mortals could stand in his way.

He closed his left fist, and the beams stopped as the spaceship bearing the name "*Solidarity*" fell from the sky.

"I thought you would be taller, Thanos."

"A single stone won't be able to oppose five. Nor could an imperfect replica of living beings could oppose Fate." Thanos charged, his fists glowing in rainbow colors.

"Oh but this one could." Barely evading the Titan's fists, Vision shot an orange beam from his forehead, hitting right on the middle of the gauntlet where the Mind Stone supposed to attach.

For a split second, the world warped, Thanos furrowed his brow as the control of the gauntlet was wrestled from him, creating a multiversal conduit that transported him and vision to another universe.

[The Devourer](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317) was rudely awakened from His slumber by the caling of mortal souls and the pair of intruders holding infinity stones.

He broke free of His yoke, hatching the salt cradle that kept Him asleep for millennia. A safety measure, installed by the very same Erikeshan mystics who imprisoned Him, destroyed the only gate connecting this world into one of mortals.

**"&%$#&No Matter. Mortal World Insignif!cant. Interest Shifted&%$#&"**

The explosion of His rebirth through the land itself thrust the intruders apart. His reign must not be challenged.

Both Vision and Thanos trembled at the towering form of The Devourer, His head rose through the sky itself far beyond the reach of the eyes.
