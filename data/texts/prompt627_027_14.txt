Sitting quietly in her beautiful court yard Rae sat looking out over her kingdom.  She watched the many marvels that happened there. The beauty of nature and woods surrounded her. A crystal water fell rushed to the forest floor not far off from her.

Rae shook her head as she saw the bright gleam of armor speeding her way. 
Another of the kingdoms enemies racing my way to rescue me, she mused.

She turned and headed toward the humungous gaping hole in the side of her mountain.  It was made to look like a cave but make no mistake it was a castle of the most beautiful design. As she walked through the golden hall she carefully put out each and ever torch preparing for her visitor. 
When Rae reached the end of the long hallway she sat in wait watching the entrance for her rescuer.

She did not have to wait long before she heard the thundering of hooves and the click clack of armor. Soon the metal man was 'stealthily' stalking towards her.

Rae rose up, "who goes there!" She demanded.

It was silent for a long moment before the man answered in a raspy voice, "Arthur of the city of Frei, knight of graylandolf."

"And what is your buisness here?"Rae boomed back.

"To slay the dragon and rescue the princess!" Arthur said.

" And what if you find the dragon and the princess are one and the same?" She asked.

Arthur stopped frozen in shock at the question. He began mumbling out an answer but Rae interrupted him with a blast of fire. 
The knight dodged, and Rae allowed a small smile to curl up her lips. Feeling the adrenalin rush through her she forces herself to be hard even down to her heart beat as the ground shook around her golden dust clouded the air. Without thought Rae turned the stone to Ice and in so doing froze Arthur eternally, still. 

Lighting a torch she walked over to inspect her prize, "Oh, and Arthur," Rae spat, "I'm not the princess I'm the king. Perhaps, if you had known you wouldn't have an eternal place in my trophy room."
