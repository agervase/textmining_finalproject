The man rolled the name off of his tongue. "Vladimir" he said in a suddenly rough voice. "How could you have possibly known who I am?"
 
I responded with a short explanation. "I don't know who or what you are. I have a gift anytime I meet someone I instantly know their name."

"Perhaps there is more to this gift than you think. You must have to delve into the minds of these people in order to know their names. Try to look further into my mind." Vladimir looked amused. My puzzled face must have been quite the sight. 

I thought very hard. At first nothing happened, but in an instant I saw all of the terrible things this beast had ever done. My face began to burn as if the very flesh was melting away. Vladimir started to fade as did my mind. I fell to my side, near the mirrors at the end of the freezers, my last sight in that store was the reflection in that mirror. A headless man.

I woke up the next day in a padded room. I must have been admitted the day before. I had known they would catch up to me I just didn't know when.

The man from the store came to visit every other day. He said it was  because he didn't want me to be lonely, but I know the truth. That hell-spawn is the reason I got caught. I shouldn't have talked I should have stayed quiet. 

He would say things like. "You're all I've got left." And. "I don't know what happened."

That man was obviously insane. Why would I be all he had left? It's not like we were family.

"Are you ready to leave?"

What was that?

"It's time."

A dark figure cloaked in rotten black cloth stepped forward.

Yes I'm ready.

A swift death.

"You're with our parents now sweet brother. I never wanted to leave you, but you had lost what was left of your ancient mind. You had forgotten the past. You had forgotten me..."
