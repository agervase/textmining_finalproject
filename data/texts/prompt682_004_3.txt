"The Devil...?" hollowly asked the girl to the kid. The boy frowned, confused by the idea of an ending coming soon.  "What's the point of being the evil one if we'll end up in the same empty room?" she asked, dazzled by the meaningless reality of an universe that starts all-over again.

Her question carved an insignia of pain inside him.

She was right, his game assassinated something more important than the universe: meaning. He, who thought that fun was a meaning itself, started to feel uneasy. The heavy and dark truth of their game was becoming more and more real and less like a fantasy.

The two kids, inside the void, a possibility of everything, felt trapped.

"Really, what's the point of a god and a demon if, at the end, they will become the same?" the girl pushed fearless and the boy felt nauseated.

"I... I... I don't know" he finally concluded. "But... isn't a game the only option we got...?" The girl looked to her right, if any. She was drowned with the suffering of having a truth that only dries reality.

"I guess if we do not play, then, it would mean the same as the final result..." she blinked, hoping darkness would take her forever. "But... what if we would never finish the game?" The boy experienced terror, a thriving and violent terror.

"A never ending game? But... what If we lose each other? What if we hate each other because one is a winner and the other one is the loser? And moreover, is that really a game if it has no end?" The eyes of the little girl became and ocean, holding all the tears left in the universe. She puts her hand in his friend shoulder.

"It will never be a game anymore. It will be reality". she finally grew up.

And the kid, that always wanted to play and have fun, realized that he had no option too.

That reality will be his only playground.

The kid did not grow up.

He started to hate the girl.

Ignorantly so, the boy was playing against his role, cheating, lying, stealing and destroying.
