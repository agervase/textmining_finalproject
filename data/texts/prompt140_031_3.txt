Death picked up the hourglass and examined it. It was pure gold, enshrined with tiny statues and sculptures of immaculate detail. He thought He recognized it, but could not place the hourglass, despite its obvious significance compared to the seven billion other bland, identical glasses.

He did the obvious thing. He looked it up on the computer. The written records had been transferred to the computer a millennium ago, and Death had long since become accustomed to the ease with which He could now retrieve records.

He couldn't believe His eyes. He forgot even to look at the name. The computer system *never* broke. But Death was pretty sure He shouldn't have had the hourglass yet for someone born in 2024967296.

He feared His Superior. He averted His eyes as His superior scanned the screen. At first Death did not understand what His superior was saying. But then He realized that His Superior was laughing. It was a strange sound, guttural yet screeching at the same time.

"Have you ever heard of an integer overflow?"

Death had, actually. He even liked to do a little programming on the side. He had never imagined, however, that such an error could happen to His Superior's own system.

His Superior parted without another word.

*Well then,* thought Death to Himself, *I guess there's nothing I can do but flip it back over. There's not that much sand left in it anyway.*

At first, Zeus didn't know where he was. Last he remembered, he had been sleeping with Athena on Olympus. He knew, at some level, that something was off.

Also, he was wet.

"Darn it, Poseidon! Why can't you ever keep to yourself?"

Poseidon did not show.

Zeus dived, searching for the peak of Olympus. There was nothing but inky black. He soared into the sky, searching for the peak of Olympus. There was nothing but inky black (it was nighttime).

In Death's office, the beautiful hourglass sprung a leak.

***

Zeus became aware of a presence that did not belong. Something was coming towards him from the depths of the sky. (He knew it wasn't Poseidon, though. Poseidon couldn't fly.)

Suddenly, Zeus was beset upon by a greater presence.

"What are you doing here?" boomed the voice of God.

Zeus didn't answer. He was still trying to wrap his head around the whole "greater presence" thing.

God did not like to be denied an answer. He saw no other choice but to smite the strange, toga-wearing flying person.

Zeus laughed at God. Who would try to smite *him* with lightning?

***

In Death's office, the last of the sand leaked out of the ornate timer.
