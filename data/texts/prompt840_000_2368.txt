My job was very interesting, I've seen the real life equivalents of Hannibal Lecter and Jason. I've seen new and creative ways people have died and I know what every single inch of a killer's mind looks like.

So of course I knew she was a killer. I saw it in her eyes, her soul. I would have loved to run but I knew too well that women normally try for hands-off killings. Shootings, poisoning or otherwise, killings which aren't brutal. Now I'm not perfect, I was foolish to even glance away for a second but when I saw the glint I dodged as the bullet lodged into my shoulder. Perfect. One more incriminating slice of evidence but I needed more, a bullet without a gun isn't worth jack shit. So I attacked. How much skin was under my fingernails? How much hair did I manage to swallow? The most important thing was they had to find my body. She wasn't a fool, her movements were calculated. Each feint was planned, each punch was practiced. The knife that tore into my eye socket was completely unexpected.

A knife? Normal killers don't bring a gun and a knife. They don't have contingency...

 I was fighting a serial killer.

My knee-jerk reaction was to raise something in defense. It happened to be a mini camera I kept in my pocket, but the flash. The flash startled us both. Her eyes narrowed, burning hatred filled her cold blue Irises. Solid evidence, a picture of a killer, covered in blood but if I died here they'd never find it. She'd see to that.

But the greatest plot was that for the pathologist's eyes only, as the life drained from me and she prepared for the kill I did the final, desperate move I could think of, and as she cut my throat, and took the camera the triumphant snarl which crossed her face said it all. As she hurled me out the seventh story window I forced a small object into my good eye, through the jelly-like substances I pushed it deep and when my bones shattered I knew I'd won.

&#x200B;

The eyes are the gate to the soul, and behind my last gate...

Was an SD card.
