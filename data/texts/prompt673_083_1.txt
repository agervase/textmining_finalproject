I grinned as the shadows grew. Even the stars were gone now, the last life a meagre sentience clinging to the merest dregs of power on a barren rock hurtling through desolation.

At long last. Life itself in my grasp. Silence and desolation. No more joy, no more suffering, no more love, no more pain. Just the calm. The calm of the end, and of me. The storm of life had faded now, for they had tested themselves against me and found themselves wanting.

I am entropy and _I am **absolute**._

When Life came to me he was a haggard old man. Half starved, half crazed. In his desperation to continue the war he had ruined himself. Nothing of the rebel, the voice of discord, remained. I chuckled. Mirthlessly.

"You think you have won-" he said

"I know I have. It all ends here."

He shook his head, his eyes moistening. "A crime that can never be undone."

He fell, and I grabbed him before he could hit the ground.

His fingers clutched in fury at me even as the last life faded from his frail form. He spoke in a choked whisper, his belly full of dust.

"You think you have won..." he said.

I sighed. "Old friend. Old enemy. It is over. You made your gambits, you fought your war, you lost."

His body grew rigid, the light fading from his eyes as his clutching hand collapsed to the floor. "Y-you think...you have won..."

Fury tore at me. "I **have** won," I bellowed. "Its over, you fool!"

He spoke then, for the last time, with a voice of strength. His eyes flew wide, and for the last second at the end of the last universe, they met with mine.

"Though there are no voices to carry its tune, you will remember the song we sang. We will live forever in you."

He smiled, and died.

I shrieked.

He'd won.
