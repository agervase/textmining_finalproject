Marnie slowly made her way through the Walmart, sliding a finger along the shelves. She sighed, picking up a can of sunscreen and watching as it began to shimmer before it faded to nothing. 

Things had been like this ever since the accident. She had watched family pictures crumble to dust upon touching them, had cried gallons and gallons of tears over losing her family even though she could still see them. She had watched them bury an empty casket. 

But then, sometime a year or two ago, everything had stopped mattering. Maybe it was that she could no longer interact with the world in a meaningful way. She had grown sick of her mother recoiling in fear every time Marnie touched her face, and she had grown sick of the way her dog, Juno, growled at her, his eyes seeing straight through her whenever she tried to pet his fur. 

There was nothing left for her here. Yet she couldn't even die. 

Someone bumped into her, and she crashed into the shelf.  

"Watch it!" she snarled, whipping around. Even though she knew they couldn't see her, she still couldn't help the resentment that bubbled up. 

The girl, with brown hair and dark brown eyes that looked too old for her age, stared at her. 

Marnie froze, then stepped to the side. 

The girl's gaze followed. 

"You can see me?" Marnie croaked. Her voice...she hadn't used it in over a year now. It sounded foreign to her ears. Raspy. 

The girl slowly nodded. 

Marnie felt her eyes prick with tears. She walked up to the girl, taking her hands in sheer ecstasy. "You're invisible too?" 

The girl slowly nodded her head and clasped her hands over Marnie's, rubbing them gently. Marnie gripped onto her hands more tightly. The only thing she'd felt ever since the accident was cold. Not even fire could warm her up. It was first time she'd felt warmth in a long, long time, and she clung to it desperately. "Do you know why you're invisible?" the girl asked. She cocked her head to the side, and Marnie noticed at she had a slightly shimmery quality to her.  

"No, I...I don't know. I've never met anyone who could see me before, and I'm just so unbelievably happy to see you. I can't even begin to--" 

"Stop." The girl raised a hand to Marnie's lips. "I would love to stand here and talk further, but we really can't. So let me just give you the shortest explanation possible." She looked somewhere past Marnie before her gaze snapped back to Marnie's. "The multiverse is real, and you're in the wrong parallel universe. That's why no one can see you. Because you're not meant to be here. I'm here to bring you back. But we have to hurry because you're running out of time. We're all running out of time."
