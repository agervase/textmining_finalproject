I climb the staircase, almost completely broken, soaked in blood and extremely slippery. One slip and I'd be at purgatory. I walk to the gates, now warped and broken, golden bars bent or broken with some people, or angels for that matter, impaled on the broken bars. Marble pillars shattered and the plinth of St. Michael split in two, I walk past it all and look inside.

I wish I hadn't, blood, bodies and viscera line the walls and floor. I had to keep down my vomit, an unpleasant feeling I knew wouldn't be gone for long. I had been a detective while I was alive, but in all my years of service I had seen nothing like this. Every step is accompanied by the squelch of guts or blood. I couldn't keep up my tough act, I had to vomit, and I did so quite heavily.

I follow a path that is soaked in less blood than the rest, if at all possible. As I walk past I see the dead faces of many, past celebrities and the faceless, just ordinary people. Eventually the dead thin out and I stop walking with a horrible squelch accompanying my step. 

God himself, a larger entity than the rest, lay with flesh flayed next to a throne. His death was long, I could tell. A pained expression was painted on his face. I vomit again to the sound of a bellowing laugh that rings hollow against the walls.

"**Welcome! You're the first to see the New Paradise!**" A pale figure says to me, sitting on the throne that God would have sat in if He were alive. Jet-black wings protrude from his shoulders, it had to be Lucifer. Not the red devil with horns, a tail and a trident I expected, I take a double take.

"**Yes, I am Lucifer, the Fallen Angel,**" he theatrically stands from his throne, bows and returns to his seat, all the while a wide, bloodied grin paints his face in a gleeful expression that goes against the scene. "**This is a shock, I can tell. Don't worry, the first few who arrive get to clean up and that's it, that's all the suffering you endure. Actually, I have had a change of heart, I'll run a better place than that old geezer!**" He laughs and raises a finger, spiriting away every last trace that a fight ever took place.

"Um, I-I dunno what to say... What do you want done?" I ask, still on edge after everything I've seen. 

"**What do I want? No, no , no, you don't understand. I have everything I could ever want, what do you want? I could destroy and recreate the world in an instant, whatever you want from me, my man**"

I stand there, taken aback. Whatever I want? What do I want here? "Um, just a little company I guess."

"**Company, you say? Why not?**" He clicks his fingers and a couple of people walk in through the repaired gates. They seem shocked but when they get a slightly modified version of the speech that I got, they all smile and nod their heads. 

"**Welcome to Paradise, ladies and gentlemen! I hope you enjoy your stay, you'll be here for quite a while!**" He says, followed by a hearty laugh that we all join in on, out of fear and genuine enjoyment.
