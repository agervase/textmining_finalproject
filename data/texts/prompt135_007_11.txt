"It's him." That's what I heard someone say as I pushed myself through the crowd. Was I getting paranoid? I was almost sure of what I heard. Did these people know me?
I had a weird feeling ever since I had to get out of my car hundreds of meters away from the cemetery. The street was packed with people and here and there was a car.  All randomly parked in the middle of the street. Seems like I wasn't the only one who gave up and had to abandon the vehicle.
'What are they all doing here anyways?' This question shot through my head for the second or third time. Was there another demonstration going on? I don't really follow these anymore. Haven't been in one for a lot of years. This doesn't explain why they are all dressed in black. And why so close to the cemetery? Was there an Asian group dressed in white?
Confused, I decided to ignore it and went to the gates.
It seems there were more and more people the closer I got. 
"Figures."I thought. "It wasn't a good day to begin with. Why should it get any better?"

I guess, someone famous died and these people are just a few hours early. Probably an actor or actress from Hollywood, which was not too far from here. Maybe a director. Funny, I haven't heard anything on the news. Not that I really watch news everyday. 
I saw a lot of emotional faces. Mostly sad people. Some of them hugging, some crying. I even saw a few that seemed to be angry. 
"Da ist er! Schaut Leute, es ist Dan!" The man who said it pointed a finger at me. What did he say? It did sound aggressive.
Other people turned and looked at first him and then me. "It's him!" Another man shouted in heavy Russian accent. Also pointing at me. He took a step towards me and seemed to be very upset. "Иван! Cмотри, Это Дэн! "
