"French seems a lot more *harsh* than I remember it..."

The thought crossed my mind as my wonderful wife spoke to my family. She seemed to be being a bit more abrupt than she needed to be - but I figured it was just a mistranslation on my part. 

I was still learning the language, after all. My little secret.

I turned my ear device on again, and she was pleasant as can be for the rest of the trip.

Yes. Definitely just a mistranslation.

It was beginning to bug me. It felt like every time I turned off the device, she'd be a lot more... rude. I wanted to think of a better word, but nothing sprang to mind. 

The only words that sprung to mind were a whole lot worse, really. 

Clearly, French is just quite a harsh language. Worse than German, if I must say.

I've kept the ear device off for a week. Something's desperately wrong, there's no denying it. 

When it's turned off, something in it malfunctions. Makes things sound like not what they are.

It makes my beautiful, amazing, radiant wife, sound like a total fucking bitch.

"There's something wrong with our devices," I urged, as she theatrically sighed once again.

"John, stop being such a whiney bitch," she replied, turning the holodeck louder. 

"Seriously, it makes it sound like you're saying terrible things!" I said, feeling hopeless. I didn't even know what was real anymore. "Please just try turn yours off?"

"Fuck it, if it will get you to shut up," she replied, fiddling with it in her ear. "There, it's off. How about I turn off my digital contacts as well? Do you want me to see like shit as well?"

She pressed her temple before I could say anything, and she blinked, looking at me. 

"...Oh sweet *Jesus*," she mouthed, staring at my face.

*****

These days, I just leave my ear device on. Easier than dealing with the malfunction, I guess.

And my wife, she leaves her digital contacts on at all times. 

She never really explained her outburst, to be honest.

I guess she just doesn't want bad eyesight, right?

...Right?
