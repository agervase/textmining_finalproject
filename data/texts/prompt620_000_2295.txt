The question isn't, "Have you ever wondered if you had a super power?" I think most people would say yes - I mean, who hasn't? No, the question in my mind, is, "Have you ever checked if you had a super power?" And if the answer to that is no, then the natural follow-up is, "Why not?" 

Bedtime routine, I check for telekinesis - it's easy enough to do and maybe the fact that it would be *really* convenient sometimes could help trigger it. Eyes closed, one hand out, picture the item you want, imagine it moving...nothing's happened. Yet. But it doesn't hurt to check, right?

Speaking of which: don't be stupid. Yes, check if you can fly. But take off from the ground, not from a roof or balcony like some clueless asshole. If you really need to jump from somewhere, then do it from the second-to-last step on a staircase.

Of course, this kind of stuff only checks whether *you* have a power. Statistically, it's *way* more likely that someone other than you has a power than that you do. So you want to check for that, too. 

Most powers have physical manifestations when they're working, so you can see it happening. Those you have to wait around for. But there are a few that you can consider. For example, the old "Think fast!" trick is a good way to see if someone has been hiding their super-speed from you. A bit cliche, I admit, but it's effective. 

But the big one is mind-readers. You won't know if someone is reading your mind, and it's not practical to go through life not thinking, or at least not thinking about anything important. So, just like with the other stuff, you do periodic checks.

Which brings me to last Wednesday. It was during the history final. I'm not sure why it had never occurred to me before that this was a prime opportunity to catch a telepath - especially one who hadn't studied enough the night before - but all that matters is that for *this* exam, I did. 

Mr. Johnson handed out the test packets, face down - cause those 30 seconds were going to make such a big deal to the students who got them first. Then he said we could begin. 

I read through the first question, then started my answer...I figured I might as well play it cool, right? 

*The doctrine of Manifest Destiny held that Americans were justified in seizing land in other parts of the continent, and was used as a rationale for GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HEAD!* 

I heard a **BANG** from across the room, and turned to see Felicia Carrow's desk had fallen over, and taken Felicia with it. Her pale face was flushed a deep crimson hue, and her long blond hair hung down over her face as she gradually stood, brushed herself off, righted the desk and sat back down. 

I was about to return to my test when she brushed her hair back and turned to stare directly at me. She was on the other side of the room, and her mouth didn't move, but I still heard her as if she were standing right next to me.

*I'm so sorry...*
