The woman sighed as she put the glass down on the worn wood of the bar counter. "Again, Jean?" she asked with a smile. 

The ancient bartender winked as he obliged, filling her glass with the amber liquid. "Long day?" he asked, his cloudy blue eyes sympathetic. 

"Very," she answered with a nod. "I had the perfect shot lined up - sun was just right, the subject positioned just perfect. I took it, but the client shorted me our agreed upon amount." 

The man took a seat beside the woman, nodding hello to the bartender. "I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear... You shoot too?" he asked her. 

Her green eyes flicked to the man, sizing him up. "I... Do, yes." 

"It's so rare to find people who have such a true passion for it," the man said after ordering a whiskey from Jean. "Do you have a preferred subject? Or will you shoot anything?" he asked. 

She gave him a quizzical look, downing the last of her drink. "If the pay is good, I'll shoot anything." 

He laughed and nodded. "Fair enough. We need to make a living, after all," he said. "How do *you* take the perfect shot? Practice as I might, I feel I can always be better." 

She considered him a moment, impressed by his dedication. "I have to be in the perfect position. The sun low, behind me. Of course I have to take the weather into account, position of the subject, trajectory. You know." 

"Huh... Trajectory. I'll have to keep that in mind for next time," he said. He was silent a moment, trying not to stare. He'd love to shoot her. "I don't suppose I could... Have your number?" he asked hopefully. 

She looked at him and stood, tossing some bills down on the counter for Jean. "Sorry, handsome, but I'm trying to focus on my career for now."
