_You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, crying all the time_

As I whistled along the convention hall, I stopped dead in my scarlet painted tracks and felt a chill rise through my lab coat to the rim of my  hat. I could almost hear them, the ghosts of men, women and children brought to their deaths as the normalcy of this world collapsed around them. "Like my work? And I was generous enough to let them live, under certain conditions of course!" I turned and looked up at the figure stepping slowly down the stairs like a comic book villain. As he came into the light, I noticed his demeanor wasn't the only thing childish about him: steampunk goggles, vampire fangs, ummm... cat ears?

-I couldn't hold back my laughter

"SILENCE!" The windows shattered as his eyes slowly turned black. "But I gotta admit, I was pretty bewildered too, it's like the universe finally recognized me for how great I am! Born as a descendant of Czech aristocracy, deserving of life's greatest pleasures! But despite my godhood, they all cared only for themselves and what they enjoyed together. Despite my glory-

"Oh believe me, those body rolls are glorious!" I said, lighting up a toy cigar and reaching for my nerfing gun

"YOU WANNA FUCK WITH ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT?! ILL WIPE YOU RIGHT OUT OF EXIST..."

*Snap* 
*Snap* *Snap*

"Seriously? The Thanos thing?"

"What the?" 

I breathed a heavy sigh, "tisk tisk."

"Your so full of yourself, so much so that you spent all your time in that fantasy land of yours, and when fantasy started to come to life, you thought u could just make all of reality bow at your feet." I began to approach his bloated, shaking frame "Hey, I thought it was all fun at first too, but let's just say my character's a little different: instead of bringing fantasy and fantastic powers to life, I uhh... bring people like you down to Earth, anchor them to reality. Normally he's here to secure and contain." I looked into his disgusting eyes, the windows of a blackened soul. "But me? I'm here to protect."

*cock*
