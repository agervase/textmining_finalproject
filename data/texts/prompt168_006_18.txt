It was mostly a joke, just something silly that three or four of us guys came up with one night out of boredom. We knew it wasn't really going to do anything for us financially, I mean hell, it was going to be as much about drinking and smoking and shooting the shit as anything. We came up with the idea that we would worship llamas. There would be rituals, possible sacrifices and/or bestiality, obviously somewhere that we could fence in a few llamas and other livestock, and we would have our own religion-based names. Of course, there would be drinking, smoking, and maybe a little debauchery here and there.  
&nbsp;
  
A couple weeks later we actually had our first gathering. I honestly thought there would only be a couple people besides us who were bored enough to show up, but we ultimately had between 16 and 20 show up that first night. Maybe they came because we held the gathering by the lake, I don't know. Maybe a couple of them had closet llama fetishes, but who am I to judge, you know? The only noteworthy thing in my mind was that this was the first meeting of the **Secret Order of the Dark Llama**, or SODL for short. I remember that we all had to come up with Order names. I was "Bull Who Pisses Into the Wind, aka Steve Perry". The bull had to do with animals in general, and the Steve Perry part was because a number of people told me back then that I bore more than a passing similarity to the old Journey lead singer when I was cleanshaven and my hair was grown out a little bit. The name also got some laughs that night as well, so bonus for me, right? I went so far as to whip up a lame website on Homestead, complete with text effects like spinning, fading, scrolling, and all that jazz. After that, we'd planned another meet-up, but I never made it.....

All I remember is heading home from work one evening, and out of nowhere a car catapulted over the barrier from the opposite direction lanes. Headlights were in my eyes and I remember shouting "OH FUCK!" as I jerked the steering wheel to the right. I don't remember an impact, or what the aftermath was. In fact, all I remember from the time the car was flying at me to waking up a few weeks ago, is something like a dream. A cold, hollow, fuzzy dream, with what might have been voices here and there.  
&nbsp;
  
I woke up in a hospital bed, with three old men looking at me in shock and happiness. They chanted "Praise the Dark Llama!" three times while looking up to the ceiling, and then looked back excitedly at me.  
&nbsp;

"Dude, I can't believe you're back!"  
"It's a fucking miracle!"  
"They said there was no chance, but we knew the Dark Llama wouldn't forget you!"  
&nbsp;

"Dark Llama, what the fuck?" I asked in response, following up with "Who are you guys?"  
&nbsp;

They looked stunned for a moment, until one of them said "Shit, that's right, you don't recognize us anymore! Dude, don't you remember? Secret Order of the Dark Llama?"  
&nbsp;

"Yeah, me and some buddies made that up, but who are you and how do you know about it, and why am I here?"  
&nbsp;

"You've been in a cryo-chamber for the last 30 years after a car accident! Bro, it's us! Joe, Nate, and Joey! You remember us, right? Well, the younger us, right?"  
&nbsp;

Before I could ask more questions or wrap my head around it, they started peppering me with details and stories. Apparently, after the accident, I was in critical condition, and while they could keep me alive, they had no way of repairing the damage to my body at that time. I would have been, at best, a partially de-limbed quadriplegic hooked up to machines just to keep me breathing and my blood flowing. My parents opted to put me in cryogenic storage, or what these days the cool kids call cryo-stasis, and hope that medical technology would advance far enough to get me out and patch me up before they died and I had to be buried. Unfortunately, my parents had died about ten years ago, my dad to cancer and my mom to suicide after his passing.  
&nbsp;

So how did I stay in cryo-stasis for 10 more years and then get fixed up by new medicine? You'll never guess, dude, because it's the craziest shit you've ever heard. I'm still not even sure if I believe it. But let me try to explain it. Basically, my buddies held another SODL meeting and told everybody about my accident. They were going to disband it since it was a joke anyway, but everyone else said they should keep it going as a kind of memorial to me. Mind you, this was before they found out that my parents were putting me on ice, or the rest may never have happened. Anyway, A couple months after that is when my parents made the decision, and when my buddies heard about it and told the rest of the SODL members about it, the grand plan was formed to file as a tax-exempt entity in order to put money aside in case some medical breakthrough happened in the next couple of years, and to help my parents pay my "storage" expenses.  
&nbsp;

Well, as it so happens, my buddies managed to keep things going, monthly meetings combined with the sad story of founding member "Bull Who Pisses Into the Wind, aka Steve Perry", and as things grew, more money rolled in and more people joined. Within 7 years they were a publicly known entity, and who wouldn't want to join an order where smoking, drinking, and a little debauchery here and there is the main priority? Of course, SODL members had to pay dues, or excuse me, rather, make donations to support the Order, which also became the "Top Off The Tank" fund for my cryo-stasis when my parents died. These guys, they're nuts, but damn, they're true friends!  
&nbsp;

Back to the present, I am a founder of a world-known religion that worships llamas, smokes, drinks, and likes a little debauchery here and there. I'm also apparently viewed as somewhat of a demi-god because of what happened to me, and the fact that because of cryo-stasis, I haven't aged in the last 30 years. It still sounds insane. I FEEL insane just thinking about it, much less talking about it, but somehow, it's true. Oh, and there's more money rolling in than the four of us could count, so we lack for nothing, and that's how they were able to pay for me being on ice for 10 years and the bionic systems that put me back together and enable me to live a normal life instead of being in a meat prison of suffering.  
&nbsp;

So, are you interested in joining the Secret Order of the Dark Llama? Smokes, drinks, a little debauchery now and then, and saying a few "Praise the Dark Llama" chants once a month? Dudes, you know you want to. Am I right?
