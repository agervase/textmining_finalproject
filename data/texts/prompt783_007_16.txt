December 20, 2017 was a normal day for me, I woke up like any other. Yet somehow, something felt strange, unfamiliar. I shrugged off the feeling, and began to move about my daily ritual. It was when I was in the shower that I experienced the first "flashback", as I've begun to call them. I was rinsing out my hair when suddenly my head felt like it split open. There was a flash of bright white light, and I found myself in a time and place unknown to me.

I could see my body, a younger version, and I was in a living room of a home that I didn't know. I was playing with my Mother and Father but something was off. I couldn't remember this moment. I couldn't recall the toys in the room, and even worse, I had no memory of the house that I was occupying. The experience was over before I could register what had happened. With another flash of light, I found myself back in my shower with an excruciating headache. I knew there was no way I'd be able to focus on my day's work, so I quickly phoned my boss and took a sick day, worrying about whatever event had just taken place within that shower. 

With my head pounding, I retired to my bed, ready to lay in the darkness and contemplate the flashback that I had just experienced. Why couldn't I recall those toys? Whose house was that? Why haven't I even seen that living room in any pictures? My mind raced and raced and I could not come up with any answers. Before long, there was another flashback. It was longer and more painful that the first, and left me with even more questions. More memories that weren't just forgotten, but seemed like fantasies.

Time to work, so I'll come back and finish this later, but I'm liking this prompt.
