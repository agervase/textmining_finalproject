"Let me see if I understand this," said Mackelroy, steepling his fingers and resting his chin on them. "This woman has been assigned ten separate units, and *all ten* have self-destructed after scanning her? Why wasn't the self-destruct mechanism disabled on the third after the first two blew up? And why did we even add a self-destruct mechanism in the first place? That sounds like a lawsuit just waiting to happen."  
  
"That's the thing, sir," said Jackson. "We *never* added a self-destruct mechanism. None of the units, not even our prototypes, had anything even remotely capable of making them self-destruct."  
  
"So how in God's name did the damn things blow up then?!" demanded Mackelroy.  
  
"We don't know, sir," said Peters. "They shouldn't have been able to, but they did. We ran diagnostics on all of the units afterwards, well, on what remained of them, and none of them had any traces of any explosives, at least none known to science. We can't explain it. But..." Peters paused and swallowed nervously.  
  
"Let me guess," said Mackelroy, standing up. "You've got this woman here, in this building right now, and you're about to have another unit scan her. Again."  
  
As if waiting for this very moment a small explosion sounded from somewhere below them, alarm bells started ringing throughout the building, followed by a very robotic voice announcing that, "This is not a drill. Everyone on floors thirty-six through forty must immediately evacuate to their designated assembly area. I repeat, this is not a drill..."  
  
"Damn it," sighed Mackelroy. "Let's go down to thirty-eight and see what's going on. Felicia, acknowledge!" he called out, loudly.  
  
The robotic warning to evacuate the building quietened down in Mackelroy's office.  
  
"Ready, sir," murmured a ladylike but still clearly synthetic voice.  
  
"What's the status on the thirty-eighth floor?" Mackelroy said.  
  
"The fire alarms appear to have been triggered by a large quantity of smoke concentrated in room three eight zero five. Oxygen levels in this room are normal, however, breathing will be compromised due to the smoke present. I cannot detect any signs of fire and so the suppression systems have not been activated. There is one lifeform present in room three eight zero five with two humans in the corridor outside. Aside from the high levels of smoke in room three eight zero five, all conditions on the thirty-eighth floor are normal."  
  
"Wait. What? A lifeform? What the *hell* does that mean?"  
  
"Sir, if you are addressing me," Felicia announced, "I am afraid I do not understand your question."  
  
"Yes, Felicia," said Mackelroy, "I'm talking to you. You said there's a lifeform in thirty-eight oh five. You said a lifeform, but two humans in the corridor outside. What do you mean a lifeform? Is there someone in thirty-eight oh five or not?"  
  
"Sir, I must apologize," stated Felicia, "there is something in room three eight zero five but it is not human nor does it match any organism in my databases. It would appear to be an entirely new species. It is bipedal, humanoid in shape and size, but it is not human."  
  
"You two!" yelled Mackelroy, turning to glare and point at Jackson and Peters. "This woman you brought in. Let me guess. Room thirty-eight oh five, am I right? **Don't** look at each other! Answer me, you idiots!"  
  
Both men stuttered and stammered with Peters managing to answer first. "Yes, sir. We had all we needed in there to monitor her condition while the unit scanned her. We...we...didn't expect..."  
  
"Didn't expect her to blow up yet another fucking unit?!" bellowed Mackelroy. "Ten fucking units self-destruct while scanning this woman, even though they don't have a self-destruct mechanism, you bring her in here to be scanned...**again!** then you leave her there to be scanned while you come up here to see me?! Aren't you fucking scientists?! Geniuses? How could you be so stupid?! Why wasn't I told **before** you started scanning her?!"  
  
"Sir!" protested Jackson, "We came up here to get you! *Before* the scan! They weren't supposed to scan her until *after* we came back with you! You were supposed to be there! Tell him, Peters! Tell him!" cried Jackson, turning to his partner.  
  
"It's true, sir, that's why we're here. We came up here to fill you in and ask you to come down to witness this scan. You **were** supposed to be there."  
  
"Damn it," sighed Mackelroy. "Fucking imbeciles. Fine. Let's go on down to thirty-eight and see what kind of woman can make eleven therapy units self-destruct all on their own. Felicia! Acknowledge!"  
  
"Ready, sir," crooned Felicia.  
  
"Bring up my elevator, and start maximum ventilation on thirty-eight. I hate the smell of smoke."  
  
"Sir, your elevator is waiting for you, and the atmosphere in thirty-eight has already been fully recycled and is back at normal levels. May I assist you with anything else today?"  
  
Mackelroy couldn't help himself. "Can you replace these two idiots with two more of you?"  
  
"I'm sorry, sir, if you're inquiring if I can be replicated, I am unaware of any process for doing that."  
  
Mackelroy almost smiled. "Thank you, Felicia. That will be all."  
  
The three men rode Mackelroy's elevator to the thirty-eighth floor then walked down the corridor towards room 3805 where two labcoat-clad figures stood side-by-side peering through the door's window into the room.  
  
"What the hell is going on here?!" bellowed Mackelroy, making the two men jump. They spun to face him and almost fell over one another. It could have been comical but Mackelroy wasn't amused. "Well, answer me? What the hell is going on?!"  
  
He strode up to the door and the two men almost tripped over one another again trying to jump out of his way. Mackelroy stopped and peered into the window. A tall, blonde woman stood inside the room with her back to the door, but as if somehow sensing Mackelroy's gaze she turned to face the door and locked eyes with him. Mackelroy hadn't become vice president of Sekhmet Industries by underestimating anyone, and his gut told him that this woman, if she was a woman, was definitely not someone he should take lightly. But he also hadn't become vice president by backing down from anyone, man or woman, and so he summoned his courage, opened the door, and walked into the room.  
  
"Just who in the hell are you?" he demanded of the woman. He took a couple of steps closer to her but found himself having to stop and shake his head to clear it. What was it? Was it her perfume? There was an aroma like cinnamon, and vanilla, and freshly baked bread, something that he couldn't quite place, but it was making his head spin.  
  
The woman laughed and Mackelroy's ears rang. "Completely wrong guess there," she said, with a booming voice that belied her appearance as it echoed through Mackelroy's skull. It left him disoriented and confused. 

*Wrong guess?* he thought. *What guess? What did I guess?* "Who are you?" he demanded, "and why are my units exploding when they scan you?"  
  
The woman spoke and Mackelroy's ears rang as if a ten thousand-voice choir had burst into song then stopped just as soon as it began. "As for your second question," she continued, "your toys were designed to provide me with aid and comfort, but I have no need of that." She laughed, and Mackelroy dropped to his knees at the sound. "You cannot improve upon perfection," she said. "And I, like all of my sisters, am perfectly made in Her divine image. Behold!"  
  
Mackelroy gasped and clutched at his ears, then desperately shut his eyes against the brilliant light. The woman's laughter filled the room deafening him, and then finally silence. Blissful silence. After several seconds Mackelroy risked opening his eyes. The woman was gone, but as he blinked his watering eyes the afterimage burned into his retinas slowly came into focus revealing a brilliantly white figure spreading its wings.
