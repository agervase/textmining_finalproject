The man turned with a wide sweep, a metallic taste in his mouth with a color that could've been confused for red wine. Regaining his thoughts, he realized he must've bitten his tongue after hearing that voice. His vision focused momentarily after, and his sight cleared from that of a foggy misconception to a crystal clear image of the blocked off entries, one single thought echoing into his head. *"Shit."* Was that thought, and it echoed. In that peculiar moment, he heard a deep-toned voice, echoing with an unsettling authority, unmatched by any mortal, yet it had a reverbrating kindness, mixed with a hint of sadness. "Hello there, my boy." The man, (mind you, the "main character" is not a day older than 23) turned with utmost confusion, yet the older man did not let him speak. "You too, it seems, have been caught into the webs of this endless game." The burgular, or young man, depending on what you prefer to call him, responded. "Game...What the actual FUCK is this?" The old man sighed, and as the young man payed attention, it was now painfully obvious that the stranger sat perched atop a staircase, like a gargoyle inflicted with depression. "None have left this prison, and you will be no different. Perhaps it may have been different..." The stranger  abruply stopped his sentence, reaching down and grabbing something black. Yet, the young man, too shocked by the events, didn't notice and thus spoke more. "What do you m-" He didn't even finish his sentence, the bullet piercing through his chest at top speed, breaking the very foundation his body relied on like butter, and shishkebabed his heart. "...if you had realized to 1v1 me, skrub." The stranger said, gulping down Mtn Dew. In the young mans final moments...he realized he had just been 360 noscoped, absolutely fucking wrecked like a spare dorito on a neck beards keyboard after walking more then 10 seconds.
