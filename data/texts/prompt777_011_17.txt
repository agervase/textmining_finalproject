Twenty years. Twenty long, grueling years of snivelling, bowing and groveling before the man who had killed his wife.

And now he was gone.

A decent man would be satisfied. But Synon was no longer a decent man. Twenty years had taken care of that.

"I was a spy, my Lord," he said to the bloated buffoon who called himself conqueror. "None wanted to see Tzar Kylm dead more than I."

"Funny," the hero condescended, looking down on his prostrate figure. "Seems to me you had twenty years to do just that."

Synon had to restrain a snarl. It came effortless, by now. "Not all men have your skill and physique, my lord."

"Maybe if you'd trained," the hero said, his upper lip curled. "Fine, you can go. I don't kill wimps."

Synon rose, as stately as he could under the circumstances. "Allow me to serve, my Lord. The Empire is complex and intricate. Surely an honourable man like you could use one of the old guarde, like me." *an idiotic man like you.*

"You? You're nothing but an old snake."

"I was on the good side, my lord."

"How convenient."

"I have the proof. Poison, plans, loyals who will attest to the scheme." Synon tried not to stroke his goatee as he spoke, a bad habbit. Made him look untrustworthy, and this new Tzar was all about appearance.

"Hm." The hero eyed him, as if only truly seeing him now. "Fine. I'll give you a seat on the next council. But I'll be watching you, snake."

Synon bowed, grinning as he turned to leave. It had been about vengeance initially, but that fire had died quickly in his cold heart, after the first year. It was the crown he was after now.

He signalled to one of his loyals that the game was on, the cogs of treason turning once more. This new Tzar was much more pliable, an honest fool.

Synon chuckled once he was outside.

He had waited twenty years.

He could wait five more.
