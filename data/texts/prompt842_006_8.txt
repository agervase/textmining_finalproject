Goddammit. God. Dammit. Always. Why's something always have to happen? Every time I try to leave. I tell everybody I don't want to, but that's not it. I do, I really do, but some shit like this always happens.

"What?! You never seen a guy with an expired license before? Maybe I don't drive, huh? Is that so weird?!"

Yeah. Keep lookin'. Look at the spectacle. I'm not a man, am I? I'm just something to gawk at so you can make your boring lives that much more enjoyable. Fuck you all.

"Look, I just went to renew this thing a few weeks ago. It...maybe didn't go as planned, nothing ever does, but it ended up alright. I know it's good."

"I'm sorry sir, but the computer says-"

"Oh? Oh, the computer says? The computer says? Well here's what I say! The computer can suck a fat chode!"

"Sir, there's no need for that kind of language."

Calm down. This guy's just doing his work for the man, same as anybody. He might be stupid but he's still human. Human, huh? Humans have emotions. Let's appeal to those.

"Alright pal, look, there's this girl, right? We've been together for a while and I'm looking to make it official. She went on a trip to Irishland or something this weekend. I thought I'd go meet her, surprise her with some chocolates, y'know. So waddaya say? Just uh, let it slide, huh? For love."

"For love?"

"For love."

"..."

"..."

"I'm sorry sir, but love doesn't keep me from getting fired."

Well, you were wrong. This guy's just a selfish dick weasel.

"Well fine! I guess my relationship is over then! Hey, hey look everybody! My love life is destroyed! You happy? You happy at the conclusion to the story!? You happy to see me suffer for your perverse pleasure! You happ-"

"What the hell's going on over here?"

Frank! Finally, a friendly face!

"This crackhead won't let me through! Says my license is expired."

"Expired? Let me see that."

"Look at it. Look at it and tell him what his stupid computer is lying about!"

What? What's that face for?

"This says Chrundle on it. It's expired because it's not your name!"

"But the lady at the DMV said-"

"The lady at the DMV kicked you out of the building for doing the same shit you're doing now! You told me you went back there!"

"I-I did. I did and she uh...she took it and-and handed it back and..."

That bitch! She tricked me!

"Okay, sir, you're holding up the line. If you can show me your tickets, I will let this slide."

"Oh! Oh, thank you. Uh, I don't have them...though. Frank, give him the tickets."

"What tickets? You said you had the tickets taken care of."

"I did, and I gave 'em to you."

"When?"

"Yesterday, at the bar!"

"Wait...wait, these? These are movie ticket stubs."

"No, they're plane tickets. See, right here, 'Isle of Doagh'."

"That says Isle of Dogs! Dammit, how'd that even happen? Argh, I was gonna be drinkin' real Irish beer this weekend! You know how fast that gets you drunk?"

"No."

"Neither do I, and now I'll never know!"

"Okay, excuse me, if you two have no tickets I must kindly ask you to both leave."

Oh, kindly huh? Kindly. Look at the nice kind guy over here!

"Fine, I'll go. But this isn't over! We'll be back!"

"No we won't, c'mon Charlie."

All the eyes. Still looking. Still laughing. Dammit.

"Look at all these people, Frank. What do they know?"

"They don't know nothin' Charlie."

"Yeah. They don't know anything."

They don't know anything!

"Don't look so down. Hey, look at it this way, you wouldn't have been able to get on the plane anyway. You probably woulda freaked out the moment they said 'departing South Philly'."

"No I wouldn't I would've...pssh, yeah you're right."

"'Course I am. Hey, what do you say we go home and play nightcrawlers?"

"Aww, we haven't done that in weeks! Hey, let's do it with real dirt this time."

"Whatever you want, buddy."

Nightcrawlers with real dirt! That's better than any Irishland.
