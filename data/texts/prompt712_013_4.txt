“You absolute BITCH!” I heard Claire, who I had grown to know as War. Her normally pale complexion turned red with rage as she continued to scream into her cell, “He was MINE! You KNEW that!” 
I knew that she was talking with Shirley— Famine— because Shirley had told me last night when I asked her why she wasn’t eating. After my day of dreading their conversation, this wasn’t as bad as I’d expected. Yes, I didn’t know that humans could turn that shade of violet, and I could swear that I saw the metal iPhone bend in her hands, but nothing had been thrown yet, and I seemed safe behind the couch.
As the conversation continued, smoke seemed to pour from Claire’s ears. Not figuratively, but it literally began to poor from her ears. Just as I began to recalculate my odds of survival, Claire burst into a coughing fit. I looked around for her sister I knew must have just walked in. Sure enough, Vanessa was checking her nails in the door frame. 
“Can you, like, shut up, I’m trying to accomplish something with my life.”
Wrong question. Claire retorted, “Your singing bullshit isn’t helping anyone! Just because you’re one of us doesn’t mean you have to ruin anyone’s life who turns on the radio!”
Vanessa stomped off in a huff, her rail-like figure’s shadow following her out. Claire looked back to her phone only to find that it was a steaming pool of metal on the ground. 
“Rough day?” Amanda inquired coolly, maintaining her ever-present collectedness. She was leaning against the wall in a light black dress. I didn’t remember her coming in, but then again, I never seemed to see her moving. Claire suddenly stopped coughing and returned to the cold pallor that the sisters all shared. “Thanks, Mandy. I’ve had it with those two. They’re just weaker than we are.”
“Indeed,” Amanda responded, “Shall we separate and find our own way?” 
As Claire bent over the cooling pool of metal, she nodded subtly. At that moment, I began talking to understand the gravity of the situation.
