*Goddamn bureaucrats. Always finding a way to make life fuckin’ miserable.*

Marlon turned around in his seat, causing the hologram-face projected at his desk to raise an incredulous eyebrow. He swivelled around again, and brought up the document.

“You want me to sign this? It’s got more clauses than I think is necessary, pal!”

The face dropped it’s eyebrow by an inch. “Look here, Mr. Sanders - let’s be realistic. This mission requires three very simple things for you to understand. 

Firstly, we’re well aware of all your past transgressions. You’re currently 345,000 credits in debt, and while your adventures with the rebellion certainly earned you quite the reputation, it isn’t possible to sustain an effort against the Empire without funds.”

Marlon stared hard into the translucent blue visage hovering in front of him. The lines on the man’s face were hard and visible, seeming to suit a man of bureaucratic disposition. They added a certain intensity to the permanent, unflinching frown plastered onto his lips.

“Second - we’re well aware of your skills, and are more than willing to pay for them. Take a look at clause 17.”

Marlon brought it up. In an endless sea of legal blurb, a single figure stood out to him.

“H-half a million credits. Shit.”

“Third - we’re well aware of our place in the world, Mr. Sanders. You might think that the research bureau is just another branch of the government, yet another shady deal, yet another fetid stink of credits under the table.

We’re men of science, Marlon. We’re asking you to get up close and personal with a system that could house xenos. Do you understand what this mission means in the history of humanity?”

“I get that, but-”

“All we care about is that whatever you discover on this mission finds itself in the hands of a scientist, Marlon. Not those scummy, materialistic assholes that you’ve spent years fighting against. Think about it - you’d be doing the rebellion a favor. Depriving your foe of another planet to-”

“And if your bureau gets caught in the act?”

“What act? None of this ever happened anyway. Right?”

x-x-x

Marlon sighed. He had ended up taking the job. Half a day’s worth of prep was now done and behind him, and he now stood in the hangar, observing his ship. The Daybreak was an older vessel, but fast, reliable and sporting a shiny new set of scouting instruments, courtesy the Research Bureau. He strapped in, punched in the coordinates, and set off.

Seri-67 was a pretty far-out system. 

The Empire’s influence stretched out in a radius nearly 100LY away from Sol, and it was around the fringes of this territory that lawlessness found it’s place. Most stations this far from the governed systems were fuelled by minor seperatist factions, smugglers and ragtag mercenary crews, lending their soldiers to whatever cause coughed up enough credits to compete and survive.

Seri-67, however, stood 250LY away from the core systems. It was about as far-out as humanity could dare itself to go.

Marlon felt the familiar jolt as The Daybreak slowed down to a halt from hyperdrive. The signal he was assigned to trace pointed in the direction of the system’s fourth planet - a small, blue orb that , according to the bureau, was the only known planet absolutely capable of supporting complex carbon-based life. He brought the ship into low-orbit. Swirling weather patterns obscured entire continents - whatever the planet had in store for him, it did not reveal easily.

The signal seemed to originate from somewhere near the north continent. Marlon unbuckled, sat back, and listened to the faint audio cues from the scanning computer.

***blip***

***blip***

***blip-blip***

Marlon sat up straight. Two signals?

***blip-blip***

Of the few seconds that followed, Marlon could only remember the sounds. A high-pitched frequency cutting through his eardrums, a deafening thunderclap that rattled the hull and shook him within his bones, and a dull, weighty thunk as his head snapped onto the dashboard and out of conciousness.

The wreck was almost graceful, you could say.

In a scorched circle of dirt stood what remained of the The Daybreak. Long stilts from the hull jutted out at odd angles, framing the still-burning engine in a halo of blackened, twisted metal. The cockpit, however, remained relatively untouched.

Marlon faded in and out of consciousness several times. Each half-waking minute was met with creaks and groans from the dying ship, the acrid smell of burning engine components, and a relentless, ever-sharpening sense of pain.

As he finally woke, Marlon reached up to the console and slowly pulled himself onto his feet. The pain in his skull flared up again, and he held his hand to his forehead, pulling it back to find it streaked with blood.

He made his way to the living quarters, one agonizing step at a time. Slamming the emergency power switch on, he slumped to the floor, waited for the power system to come back online, and croaked “Medunit activate.”

The starboard wall of the room split down the middle, revealing a hidden alcove. A small, metallic figure unfurled itself from within, revealing two legs attached to a central unit equipped with a host of sensors. It booted up, surveyed the room and noticing Marlon, quickly skipped towards him.

“Hello commander. I am a standard issue medunit, equipped to your ship to assist you in any manner of medical aid as per your requirements. I respond to ‘medunit’ for any voice activated commands. If you wish to rename me, please address me by any name you choose-”

“Will…you…shut the *fuck* up…and run a diagnostic?!”

“Medunit name registered as ‘Will’.”

Marlon crumpled into a tight ball on the floor - the pounding in his head grew louder as each second passed.

“Injury detected. Would you like Will to run a diagnostic, commander?”

“YES!” Marlon screamed.

“Running diagnostic.”

Marlon groaned as he sat up to let the unit scan him.

“Multiple minor bruises detected.”

It paused for a second as it traced over his head.

“Fracture detected.”

“Possibility of severe brain trauma. Running neuro-psychological diagnostic.”

Marlon waited, the medunit hanging it’s sensor a few inches above his nose.

“Running neuro-psychological diagnostic.”

The seeds of panic were beginning to take root in him, as he wrestled with the pain.

“Running neuro-psychological diagnostic.”

He pushed the medunit away.

“Running neuro-psychological diagnostic.”

It turned to look at him.

“Running neuro-psychological diag-”

The machine quivered, emitted a few unintelligible syllables in rapid succession, faster and faster as it’s instruments seized up - as suddenly as it began, it stopped and powered itself down.


Standing there, looking right at Marlon.
