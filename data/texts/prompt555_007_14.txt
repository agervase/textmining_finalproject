It had already been an hour, but Frank could still hardly contain himself. Sure, it was clich√©, but he still got a laugh from calling for a crustless pizza with cheese. This time, he was calling Loera's pizza Kingdom, that new sketchy place set up from Mexico. What sort of Mexican makes cheese pizza anyway?
He startled up at the heavy thump that came from his door. Opening it, a man a full head taller than Frank and twice as wide stood before him, wearing a torn and grimy delivery outfit clearly to small for him.  "You the one who ordered the crustless cheese pizza?" he asked in a deep broken English language. Frank had not expected this. 
"yeah, I am. Now give me the pizza." Frank felt he wouldn't be saying that to the threatening man at his doorstep if he hadn't gone through all the vodka. 
"Show me the dough first," said the man, pulling the pizza box away from Frank's grasping hands.
"You guys sell pizza; you should have way more dough than I could ever give you."
"We needed a lot of dough to get this pizza ready, so I won't give you nothing without you showing me some bread, dough and cheddar."
"Is this some new Abbot and Costello skit? Look buddy, if you are asking for money, tell me what I owe you. No, in fact, you were over 30 minutes late, so I think I get it for free. "
His slurred speech was interrupted by the gun pressed against his forehead. "Hombre, I don't know where you come from, but there is no way I am leaving without that dough. So bring me that 20 grand so you won't die today."
Frank had had it with this man. "I see, you are trying to prank me back. Well I will let you know that there is no way I am spending that much on a crustless cheese pizza. I can find places to buy it for less than 5 bucks!" 
The man's eyes narrowed. "My boss would love to hear this I think. If you tell him, you might get your pizza free." Frank shrugged and followed the man to the black van below. 
"These guys clearly know nothing about pizza" he thought to himself.
