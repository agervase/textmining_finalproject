EDIT: I've added a relatively brief Part 2 in the comments. I have more in mind, but I'll probably make a [PI] a bit later. If you guys keep showing support I'll definitely keep writing xD Stay tuned!

I blink open my eyes. I’m in a windowless room with bare cracked concrete walls, no furniture, and rickety steps up to a rusted metal door. A scared-looking stranger is sitting against the wall across from me- his gaze flicks from me to the walls to the door in a nervous cycle. I stand up calmly and head for the door. The stranger leaps to his feet and intercepts me. 

“El, hold it, please, um, you said that you didn’t want to leave this room today. You said not to let you leave this room.” 

I blink at him. “Why would I say that?” 

“Um, I’m sorry, I don’t know. It’s just what you said. You were very insistent, you said to keep you here, and not to let you go out no matter what you said.”

“Well that’s dumb. You should ignore what I said then. I’m going to have a look outside. And don’t call me ‘El’, call me by my full name if you please.” I walk around him and start going up the stairs. The poor fellow seems quite agitated by my refusal to follow direction. Oh well, not my problem. I know that there are things to do, and I have a limited time to get them done. 

I step out the door onto a broken and empty street. It looks as though “I” had picked a good building this time, in the section of town that was still relatively solid. The red sun blazing in the east told me it was sometime midmorning, maybe nine or ten o’clock. The stranger had followed me outside, and seemed to have given up on his hesitant efforts to stop me. Wearing a long, ripped coat he’d pulled out from somewhere, he checked that his weapons, a pistol and a long knife, were safe in his belt. “Soooo…. If you’re not planning on spending the day holed up…. Where…?” he queried. 

I closed my eyes to listen. The wind moaned through shattered windows. Foundations creaked. Pebbles clattered to the ground. Dust hissed as it slid through cracks. In the distance, a yipping, howling noise like hunting hounds began. I turned in that direction and began to run.

El woke up as the sun was setting. She could see that the sun was setting, because she was in her room at the base, which had a window… five miles away from the safehouse she had made certain she was in that morning. 
“Damn it, damn it, damn it!” She ripped off the covers of the bed, swung her legs over the side ready to go beat the daylights out of Josh, and froze. Her clothes were torn and covered in blood, and there was a clumsy bandage on her left thigh and left forearm. Serious injuries in this place were very bad news, since the Survivors had only a limited supply of antibiotics. Judging by the amount of blood on the clothes and bandages, she had somehow been hurt quite badly today. Breathing slowly through her nose, she unwound the bandage on her arm, to see what the damage was…

Nothing. Not a scratch. No stitches, not even any bruising. And it didn’t hurt at all, nor did the leg. This was very odd. Where had all the blood come from, and why waste precious bandages on cuts that weren’t there? While El pondered this, the door opened.

“Oh good, you’re up.” A crisp male voice said from the door. El jumped to her feet and turned, saluting. “Sergeant.” 
“At ease.” The sergeant waved her down. He was one of the de facto leaders of this Survivors enclave, and the person in charge of defense of the base, as well as expeditions and protecting groups that went out to scavenge. Military lifestyle and discipline was not required, but the sergeant encouraged it in the people he directed. It was all in the name of survival. 

Josh was standing at the sergeant’s elbow. He seemed agitated, and wouldn’t look directly at El. 

“Congratulations, soldier. You did a good day’s work, and we have five new Survivors with you to thank for their lives. Though I will say, engaging a pack of Blood Seekers by yourself with a single backup to get you out if something went wrong… well, that was extremely risky, and I cannot condone any soldier risking their lives, even to save civilians. Every one of us is essential for the defense of the base. You will report at seven a.m. for your disciplinary assignment.”

“Yes, sir.” El replied numbly. She had… engaged a pack of blood seekers? Alone? And won?!? On top of the Mystery of the Vanishing Injuries, her head was beginning to spin. 

“Well, you seem to be well enough, but make sure you rest tonight. Joshua was quite worried about your injuries when you came back, I suppose we can count our blessings that they were shallower than he thought. I’ll leave you two.” The sergeant turned and left, El belatedly realizing that she had forgotten to salute. 

Josh stood near the door, shuffling his feet. After a minute, El broke the silence. “Okay, you are going to tell me. What the fuck happened?”

“You… you changed. I’m sorry El, I couldn’t keep you in the safehouse. You were very firm about leaving. You didn’t really sound like you either. Well, you did, I mean it was your voice and the way you talk and everything but like, your mood completely changed. And you didn’t seem to know me. And you told me to call you by your full name.” This was a surprising detail to El, who hadn’t let anyone call her by her full name since before The Disaster. “You went seeking, you found those people being chased by Blood Seekers. You ran, El. Faster than I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t keep up. And you kept going and going even when I was totally winded. It was incredible. You just leaped over rubble, or climbed up the side of buildings with your bare hands. Sometime I lost sight of you, but I caught up when you reached the pack. You screamed at me to protect the civilians while you…. While you fought….” He turned pale and shook his head, seemingly lost for words. “Well, we got them back, but you were bit. You bled a lot, I really thought… it was bad. You kept insisting that it would be fine though. Then we came back to base, and you fell asleep.”

El sat on the edge of her bed with her head in her hands. “I didn’t know any of that Josh. I can’t remember anything since we were sitting in the safehouse, until I woke up just now.” Josh turned another shade paler. El suddenly stood, went over to a box and fished out a piece of paper and a pen. “Thanks for watching my back, Josh. Go get some rest.” He nodded and left. For now, El needed to think…

I read the letter that I had found myself clutching when I opened my eyes into this dream, and smiled. Things seemed to be getting a bit more interesting. 

“Whoever you are, whatever you are, whatever you think you are doing- please stop it. Your intentions don’t seem to be bad, since you keep saving people using my body, but this really can’t continue. I lost a lot of blood yesterday. I don’t know how you got the injuries to heal, but one of these days it’s going to be worse. You could get me or my friends killed with your antics. If you save people because you care about people’s lives, this should matter to you. Not to mention the loss of liberty you inflict by taking over my body. Tell me who you are. Please write your reply, and don’t run off! You have to report to the Sergeant’s office at 7 for punishment work. And stop telling my friends to call me something other than ‘El’!

~ El”

El scanned the note she had found in her pocket and felt goosebumps shiver down her arms. It had been written on the back of the letter she had left herself that night, and the handwriting matched her own. 

“Very well, El, I shall explain and I hope it helps. I am you. Or perhaps, I am you as you would have been if the world never experienced an apocalypse. I have no control over when I appear in your world- in your body. It happens when I am asleep. It happens when I dream. You are right, I mean no harm. I want to help. Every time I appear in your world, I know there are people in danger, and I could help them. I will do my best not to put anyone you know in danger, but you should know, you are not in any danger yourself. When I am in control, it is a lucid dream. I can do anything. YOU can do anything. Super strength, super speed, infinite endurance, telekinesis, flight, even shapeshifting and walking through walls- yes, I have tried all these things, and they work. Oh and I can heal your injuries pretty much instantly. Sometimes I forget until a fight is over though, so sorry about yesterday. Anyway, here’s the deal. I’m going to do my best, so why don’t you help me help you? Maybe we can work out a beneficial arrangement.”

Her hand shaking slightly, El wrote three words at the bottom of the paper.

“Alright- prove it.”
