Since Birth, every person has known the words that would summon Death to them, and in that moment their life would end. Each person had different ones, some of them were unique, while others were simple, single words. Those were the most dangerous, stories were told of children that were given the word "mom" or "dad". In an attempt to combat this, parents would keep vigils over newborn children learning to speak, hoping to prevent them from speaking their words of death before they understood the consequences. Humans had long discovered that Names were exempt though, so it became vogue for children to call everyone by their first name, including their parents.

You were a lucky one. Your words were long and absurd. if you had managed your life differently, you could have joined the council of elders, those who had lived 250 or more years. after all, if you never speak the words, you can never die. But you made a mistake, and found yourself defending yourself in court. if you were convicted you would be tortured until those words you dreaded saying would be a sweet release.

Having spoken to your lawyer, you have decided to speak the truth, and in doing so, end your life. Granted you could have found a way to tell the truth without death, but you were going to be destroyed by what you said either way. if you died, you wouldnt see the mockery.

"You stand here accused of unrighteous conduct with a goat! how do you plead?"
"Not guilty your honor! **I find Goats uncouth beasts, though I have shagged the occasional sheep!**

When the spectre of death appeared, you smiled until death said, "I never said your words of death would end your life. I just said they would kill you." He grinned, an semmingly impossible task for a skull, as he said, "those words certainly slayed me." with that the spectre vanished, as you find yourself at the end of your life as you knew it.
