The digital tune of the doorbell arouses me from my evening meal. Overlayed onto my vision is a live feed from the security camera over the door. The facial recognition software identifies my guest as a female government official whose bio has been redacted.

I have two options: use my automated personal assistant, which I must admit has improved quite a bit from the days when smartphones were still a necessity, or answer it myself. I take the latter, being the old-fashioned gentleman that I am.

The door opens to my command and I gaze out upon a rather attractive African American woman, age locked in her late-twenties.

"What a house you have," she says. "A lot for a man to acquire within 300 years."

I laugh. "Thanks, but may I ask your reason for coming here?"

"Of course," she holds out an ID card from the Population Management Discretionary Commission. "We have reason to suspect you for unadulterated abuse of the drug Fountaine."

"What kind of evidence do you possess?" I ask, making a genuine effort to look perplexed.

"Your exact DNA has been recorded in databases originating over 2,000 years ago, ones we have recently gained access to with a department merger."

"That's weird...um, I guess I'll come with you to try to clear things up." I inch back into my foyer. "Let me just grab a few items."

Her expression turns chilly. "Sir, 2,000 years ago was before my department was even instated to deal with the overpopulation crisis. If this were true, I am afraid I will have to order you for immediate euthanasia. Please, come with me right now."

I stumble back and order my PA to lock the door. I'm dashing through my hallways, cursing myself for building such an extravagant and winding property. My lungs, even with the innumerable operations, are wheezing when I arrive at my garage and hop onto the motorcycle.

"Athena, please pilot me to the nearest port." I voice as the bike revs up in response to my touch.

I'm not gonna die, not today. I laugh.
