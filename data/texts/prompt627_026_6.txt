Fina seethed at the sight before her. Cracks crawled upon what just yesterday was shining scales of silver. The being she loved more than any other lay before her. Body covered in wounds, glory covered in woe.  


"With all due respect Sire, this venture was not only expensive but also extremely dangerous. A juvenile silver dragon is still a "dragon" and we feel that..."  


Boiling. The bastards that hurt Fred were actually trying to bargain for a greater reward from her father! They should be pleading for their lives instead. If only- the hand on her shoulder steadied her, calm both from familiarity and a decidedly mystical nature flowed through her.  


"Keep calm Princess Lanafina, remember the plan. Trust in your family and Fred will be safe."  


Fina didn't know if she trusted her father, but she trusted her teacher. It was.. difficult, but she made the effort and kept the illusion of the polite, smiling and hapless princess going. After what felt like a millennia the "Adventurer"s left. The runes on the great door barely finished sealing before she leapt from her chair and flew, literally, to the crumpled form on the floor.  


She ripped apart the chains binding him and channeled her mana into him. She felt it then, the beating of his heart, the source of his magic still flowing. An immense raging river for a human, but a tiny trickle for a dragon! Fina wrapped her wings around him, Frederick, her dearest baby brother. So young, too young to die, too young and too weak to fully control his illusions and forms.  


She looked back to see two old men talking. One garbed in grey and short of stature. One the size of cathedral hall. She kept healing her brother as they discussed a new plan. One which to keep their centuries long family secret safe. If Fred cannot maintain the image of a man then it was time to come up with another kind of illusion. On that night, in the eyes of the world, Fina became the first princess ever.. to tame a silver dragon.
