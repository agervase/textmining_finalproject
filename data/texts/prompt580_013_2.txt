Uncle's keys feel heavier in my hands than they have in the past.  I turn the antique key in the lock, and push open the heavy wooden door, just like I've done at least a thousand times. But this time is different, this time, I don't yell out to my uncle, I don't hear the shuffle of his slippers across the floor or the clanging of metal as he rushes through the clutter to wrap me in a hug.  All I hear is silence, I let out a breath, and close the door behind me.

&#x200B;

*I guess all this is mine now.*  I look around at all of the objects that litter the house, I feel a small pang of anxiety hit me, as I take in the enormity of what I've just inherited.  *What do I do with all this stuff?* I never really paid attention to all the things my uncle collected.  He used to show my some of his treasures when I was young, usually accompanied with an even stranger tale of how it was acquired; but as I got older, the rate of his hoarding began to accelerate.  There wasn't time to keep up with all of his treasures, so I just stopped asking.

&#x200B;

My uncle's hoarding was like a big elephant in the room, and I can't stress enough, how BIG the elephant was.  Being a hoarder usually means that a person finds comfort in the possessions that surround them, but my uncle seemed to find strength in his, each object would motivate him to find the next.  I don't know if he was working towards some kind of goal or if he was just obsessed with material things, but he managed to cover every inch of this mansion with some kind of obscure artifact.

&#x200B;

*He must have kept some kind of inventory.* I make my way towards his study, in the hopes of finding some kind of log of his finds, when I bump into a lamp, which triggers a small avalanche of antique novels.  I kneel down to pick up the books, when I feel a slight breeze brush across my arm.  I look around for a window, but nothing is open and all the curtains are drawn.  I hover my hand over the floorboards, trying to feel for the breeze again.  I feel the cool air flow across my arm, this time feeling for where it's originating.  The air seems to be moving up from the floor...which is strange since the only thing beneath is a dingy old basement. I look closer at the floor, I don't see anything out of the ordinary- old floorboards, a dusty rug, miscellaneous books, and even more dust.   Just for the hell of it, I lift up the rug, and find a trap door.  *Ok, what the hell?* I don't believe I would have never noticed this, come to think of it, I don't remember there even being a rug here before.

&#x200B;

Since this can only get stranger, I move to open the trap door.  I hesitate, preparing myself for what could lie ahead, I could discover something about my uncle that I wasn't ever supposed to see. *I can't turn back now*.  I lift open the door, and start to descend the dark steps into the unknown.  With each step, I feel the temperature begin to drop, I reach for my phone in my pocket so I can shine a light into the darkness, but all of a sudden I hear a crack and series of fluorescent bulbs begin to illuminate over my head.  My eyes squint in the bright light, only to reveal a very sleek looking office.  Well, office isn't exactly as I would describe it, more like a command center.  There were three huge monitors sitting on top of a very modern looking glass desk, shelves with illuminated artifacts lined the walls, and a very sturdy safe was occupying the back wall.

&#x200B;

*What is this place? Was uncle secretly Batman?*  I notice that the middle monitor is blinking and I walk over to the desk, and top on a key on the keyboard.  The monitors wake up, and prompt for a password or a finger print scan.  *Well, great, I'll be here for ages.* I absently tap my fingers on the keyboard, trying to guess a password.  I begin to type:

* Liverpool2005 (his favorite football team's last won title)
* Arsenalsucks (his least favorite football team)
* Padfoot (he was a harry potter fan)

All fail, and all are pretty weak password guesses...I tap my fingers again in frustration.  I hear the computer bonk when my fingerprint isn't read.  I chuckle to myself, and press my pointer finger onto the scanner.  Instantly, the computer unlocks and I'm eye to eye with my uncle. Before I can even process why my fingerprint is recorded onto a computer I have never seen, I click to play the video.  My uncle's booming voice fills the underground lair, and I have to catch my breath.

&#x200B;

'Dearest Amelia, I hope this message finds you well.  I'm sorry that you have to deal with this through video, and not in person, but believe me, it's better than a handwritten letter between the pages of a book like my father had left for me.  As you know, I have passed, and I have left all of my possessions to you.  You are to inherit everything, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Amelia, there are so many things I want to say to you, but there is only so much that I can say that will actually help you.  I am a Guardian.  I have spent my entire life traveling the Earth in search of precious artifacts that could potentially lead to the destruction of the planet if placed in the wrong hands.  There are abound 60 of us, placed around the world.  Each one has been anointed by a family member, chosen to continue the lineage and the mission.  I chose you, Amelia.  You must continue the fight, you must protect the Earth and its people from destruction- it is your birthright. Go to the temple located on St Marks Place in the middle of the number 1 and Alpha.  Once inside, ask to speak to Prongs, say Padfoot sent you. They will explain the rest, I don't want to give you too much detail, in case this message falls to the wrong hands. But, if this is you watching Amelia, know that I love you, and you can do anything you set your mind to.  You are strong, you are brave, I have no doubt that you will be one of the greats. Goodbye.'

&#x200B;

The screen went black, and I suddenly became very aware of my breathing. *What the hell was that? I am a Guardian?  Is this some kind of joke?*  I sit there, stunned, trying to process what just happened, where I was, or even if I was awake.  I pinch myself.  Yep, I'm awake. I go to click on the video so I could watch this mystery unfold once more when I hear a creak above me.  All the hairs on my neck stand up.  I hear a creak again, this time a little further away.  *What do I do?*  I catch myself in the reflection of the monitor and realize that I need to destroy the video.  I log back into the computer, and try to search for the origin of the video.  I hear a creak again, this time closer.  Ok, I can't waste any more time on this.  I power off the computer, take out my pocket knife, and I jab it into the tower, hoping to do as much damage as possible.  At least that will slow them down a bit.

&#x200B;

I put the knife back in my pocket and slowly head toward the stairs.  I hear another creak, this time above my head, and I look around the room in panic.  *There has to be another way out of here.* In the corner, I spot a cloak hanging from a hook, in desperation, I reach for it and put it on.  In an instant, I disappear.  *NO WAY!*  There's no time to react, as I hear footsteps come down the stairs.  I move into the corner, hoping that this cloak isn't somehow defective or my hyperventilating doesn't reveal my location.

&#x200B;

'Someone has been here before us.'

'Do you think it was her?'

'Already? There's no way she could find all this, this quickly...'

'Or maybe there is.  She is in the prophecy after all, she's not just an ordinary girl.'

'We're all in the prophecy Aiden.'

'Yeah, be she's special.'

'Whatever, I'm sick of hearing about her.  Let's figure out where she went.  The faster we finder, the faster I can be done with this.'

'Darrel is not going to be happy she's been here before us.'

'Just grab the computer and let's get out of here. Who knows when the Guardians will show up.'

&#x200B;

I hear someone rip the PC from the wall, and then two sets of footprints run up the stairs.  Once I hear them disappear, I stand there panting- *what is going on? who were those people? why did they know about me? prophecy? what prophecy?*

&#x200B;

So many questions were racing through my head.  *I needed answers, I needed to find the temple.* I take a big breath and make my way to the staircase. I emerge from the trap door, the room is darker in the late afternoon.  I make my way to the front door.  *And so it begins...thanks Uncle.*
