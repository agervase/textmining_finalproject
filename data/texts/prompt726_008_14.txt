I'm part of the first colony that arrived into Exsoleil. The fourth planet of a neutron star in the middle of the galaxy. It is very likely that we have been the happiest generation of humans that has lived since they originally fully evolved. 

Life on earth was tough. A planet full of living beings that get  nourishment from other living beings. You have to kill to be able to live on earth. Many people think humans are fucked up by nature,  but I'm convinced they're fucked due to nature.

Exsoileil however was almost deserted of life comparatively. Huge oceans and a small strip of land that sustained us. the only life before us were protozoa like organisms and abundant vegetation. no evolved animals existed on exsoileil.

we were raised by robots that look like that wall-e movie they once showed us. slightly anthropomorphic robots that were cute enough for baby us.

we were like the Buddha, raised without any of the ugly aspects of life. up until our 20's we were a second paradise. we had no words like depression, assassination, despair, violent or sin. 

I don't really know what or how happened but the fuckedupness of humans could not be taken out of the embryos by our forefathers. 

by the second generation we had bad things happened already. perhaps because they were raised by us humans but it was no longer a full paradise.

we still have not had wars. as the oldest member of humanity I was given access to hidden parts of human history we never learned from the robots. I got to know all about religious, political, ancient and drone fought wars. it's like if humans were wired towards destruction. 

I cannot tell what the future might hold for us. will we be tamed by exsoileil's peaceful environment? have we substantially reduced the amount of lifespan of this young planet?
time will tell
