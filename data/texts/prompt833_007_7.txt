“Let there be light!”

Oh they do love that bit! They think of being born and opening their eyes for the first time. Splendid! I was going for that.

“And He called the dry land Earth.”

Her name is pretty. If they only knew that came to me in a dream!

“He called the light day and the darkness night!”

Yeah, but…I gave them the sun and that thing does not stop pushing it out. But I guess if they want to think of its power starting and stopping maybe it’s easier. Anyways, need to keep going.

“Let the Earth bring grass and seed and tree.”

That I made those seeds sleep in the winter and then come back to life in the spring. A nice touch, I’d say.

“And God made the stars and set them in the heavens.”

Wait. No, they aren’t in heaven, they are their neighbors. I wanted them to know they aren’t alone no matter where they are.

“And I shall bless the animals to be fruitful and multiply.”

Such a simple formula, too. Perfect balance and harmony and everything and everyone has what they need. Though, this is missing the part where I told them, my human children, to appreciate it more than any other because they have a hunger that might interfere with that balance.

“Let us make man in our image.”

That’s a bit troubling. My children are beautiful but I don’t have five fingers and toes. They want to see themselves as a part of me but I’m a part of the tree in their yards and the worm they just stepped on. If they think they look just like me they’ll think they have my power and my sight and some will be corrupted by this. A lot may be corrupted by this! How it was meant to be was, see yourselves in each other.

I wonder if this is a good idea.

“And God divided the light from the darkness.”

This book’s story is feeling heavier to me now. These hard delineations were never my plan. In the world I’ve shown them the brutality of a volcano brings the lush soil it produces, so do not hate the volcano. If they think there is only ever one way or another, that a thing is light or dark, they will be divided. And that will bring suffering and pain.

I worry this may divide them.
