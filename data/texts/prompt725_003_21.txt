**Day 1:** The escape pod crash-landed near solid ground.  Wesley's badly injured, but I've managed to stop the bleeding for now.  We've already activated the distress beacon.  Given how far out we are in the system, could be some time before anyone finds us.

It's night time here, decided it would be better to wait until it's light out before searching to see if any of the other pods landed nearby.

**Day 2:** 16 hours and daylight still hasn't come.  I'm not sure of the specifics, but it seems that this planet has a longer day-night cycle than Earth or any of the other worlds.  Dermal photo-cells have enough energy stored up to last me for several days.  Hopefully I'll have found help by then.

Wesley's injuries keep opening back up.  He and I keep closing them back up, but it's a losing battle.  Unless I can find someone or something to help, he likely bleed to death within the next few days.

Radio and black band still not picking up any signals.  I'm horrified that we might be alone out here.

On the good side, the pod finished an analysis of the atmosphere and deemed it fully breathable and clear of contaminants.  Will start searching tomorrow.

**Day 3:** No signs of any plant or animal life, or anything analogous to that.  Got lucky and found a stream not far from the crash site.  Analysis showed it clean of any toxins that the filters couldn't handle.  At the very least, we shouldn't die of thirst any time soon.

**Day 5:** Spent the past two days searching for signs of anyone else.  We're alone out here.

Wesley's now constantly drifting in and out of consciousness, and I'm afraid there's nothing more that I can do for him.  He doesn't have much longer now.

**Day 6:** Wesley passed away several hours ago.  He was unconscious, and went out peacefully, thankfully.  With daylight still yet to arrive, I fear that my fate may not be as pleasant.  I've got maybe a day or two left of energy.  If the sun doesn't rise by then, I'll be facing starvation.

**Day 7:** Photo-cells stores are empty now.  I dread what's about to happen.

**Day 8:** Everything aches.  It's hard to think, and it takes all my willpower just to move.  Having trouble just writing this.  Not even enough energy to bury Wesley's body.  Lack of bacteria on the planet has slowed its decomposition, but the smell.  Something about the smell...

**Day 9:** I remember reading before we had photo-cells, our ancestors survived by eating things- putting things in our mouths and crushing them between our teeth and then swallowing the pulpy mess.  Desperately tried eating dirt to see if that helps, but it only made me feel worse.

I can't stop noticing the smell of Wesley's corpse.

**Day 10:**  Everything hurts, desperate.

Can't stop looking at Wesley's body.

Have idea but afraid.

**Day 11:**  I'm alive.  Not just alive,  but full of some strange energy.  It was a risky proposition, but it paid off.  I'm feeling pretty disgusted with myself right now, but am trying my best to push it aside until after I'm off this rock- survive now, grieve later.

I found a bio-bag to put Wesley in until I could bury him.

**Day 12:** The aches came back.  Now I know why mankind developed the photo-cell implants.  The old-fashioned way is horribly inefficient energy-wise.

I still haven't found anything growing here on this planet.  I'm afraid of what I'll have to do.

**Day 13**: The energy rush is intoxicating.  You get so much from eating, but too much of it gets burned through by the body before it can be stored.  So inefficient, but it'll work.  Don't know if Wesley would approve- I'm sure he'd understand the necessity of doing whatever it takes to survive in harsh conditions.

**Day 16?:** Harder to write, but am alive.  Wish Wesley was still alive to know how it feels to eat things.  Still enough left of him that I should be able to survive here for a while.

**Day 20?:** Signal from pod.  Patrol boat is ccoming and will be here in a ffew days.

**Day 24?:** So good.  Can't stop feeding.  So good.  Still hungry all the time.

**Day ??:** Wesley gone now.  HUnger.  Still no light mfest feed.

**Dae #>>>:** Ship here.  Must show them.  SHow them what its like.  How good it is to eet.
