Pro-gamers tend to be quick, able to react with lightning speed to any new situation, even unexpected ones. That reflex had saved Randy's life as the razor sharp pointer slammed through his screen and went straight for his forehead. It was massive, black, glossy, and now reflected just a touch of red as the teen's hand slowly bled down its angular form. 

Randy "Dragon Rage" Eikcousman stared at the object impaled through his palm with one part dumb fascination and one part horror. Slowly the idea of what happened slipped into his mind's eye, that he should probably be screaming with said horror, that the reason wasn't just the massive amount of pain lancing through his hand but also the fact that the object in question wasn't supposed to exist in real life. It slowly dawned on him that he was, in fact, screaming, but hadn't been aware enough to realize how hoarse his voice had become. A little while later, partly from blood loss and partly sheer shock, his vision flickered in and out before all his senses collapsed into a blank void. 

Some uncountable time later, his mother's screaming woke him back up, followed by panicked, awkward flailing, the cursor slamming down against his chair, desk, bed post, and keyboard, all of which suddenly started to subtly glow and pulse. Of course this also hurt like hell, serving to remind him he'd been stabbed by a digital object, the object was still in his hands, and he was bleeding excessively from said wound. Unsurprisingly, he blacked out again. 

In his dreams he relived the moments just before his wound, albeit in some strange inverse timeline. The moment the mouse had ripped through the plastic covering his LCD, leaving behind pieces of silicon and a strange grey liquid. How he'd slammed his mouse against the screen after losing a fight. The game he had been streaming to his fans moments before, all of them urging his legendary rage, his handle's namesake, on. The new software that let them connect directly to his movements, living out the rapid movements as if they were his own. The seedy startup company that had offered him the streaming contract so he could quit school and play full time, despite his well known rage issues.

He woke to strange faces and lights flashing in front of his eyes, as well as the jumbled sound of conversation. "Ma'am, look, ma'am, calm down, look, he's all right. See eyes are open and everything. We'll get him to the hospital, no worries. You can calm down now." The faces looked concerned, confused, but determined. "Son, son do you know where you are"

Croaking out a slurred sentence that may or may not have been "the fuck?", he tried to push himself up, only to feel lancing pain in his arm. "Hold on, hold on, don't move that arm. You hurt yourself on one of your toys son. Ease up a bit, there we go. We're going to give you a little something to relax you now..." A sharp pain hit his leg, and suddenly a rush of warm liquid flooded his veins. Randy noticed the man was in a white shirt and jeans, a red cross patch on his shoulder. Vainly flailing, trying to comprehend even the slightest bit of what was going on, his hand slapped against the man's own arm, suddenly adding another glow to Randy's vision, not just the pulsing light from before, but a whole box of text right next to him. It read 'MED_PARAMED_FF3813A' at the top, with bolded options underneath. "FFfffebsswhaaThe FUCK?!" The flailing became even worse, his hand intersecting into one of the lines of text. 

> 'Virus scan initiated, processing'

To his horror, the object suddenly morphed into a rapidly spinning gyroscope, tearing a larger hole in his palm and causing everyone to jump back in terrified surprise. "What the hell is tha...Oh my god Frank, Frank what the hell is happening to you!? Frank! FRANK!" 

The paramedic who was being scanned was frozen in place, his body slowly crystallizing before everyone's eyes. Randy's agony was slowly dulling, a product of the morphine finally hitting his brain, but it only served to finally let him see beyond the vicious pain in his hand to the box.

> 'Quarantining threats: 

> Malware-Standard-Rhinovirus

> Adware-Nicotine 

> Malware-Standard-Escherichia coli

> Adware-Worm-Pop songs [+ see all in category]

> Adware-Trojan-Rickworth's Frozen Steakums (Well Done)

> ... '

The stream of text were only a few seconds in running by before the object returned to cursor form and another prompt came up. 

> 'Permanently Quarantine, Remove Threats, Remove File, Ignore Threats'

Randy could barely focus, his hand hovering drunkenly to the rhythm of his heartbeat, the warmth in his veins (and also pooling out of them). He had gotten drunk on stream before. High too. There was even that time he'd been convinced to do bump of coke for each series won on a tournament night. He could focus, he knew he could, his hand poised over the fourth line. He squinted, timing the weaving drunken limb, and punched straight through the box. 

> 'Archiving Quarantine file'

The gyroscope exploded into being again, spinning up faster than before, pacing itself to the crackling of crystals growing a foot thick around poor Frank's body. The last thing Randy remembered before blacking out once more was seeing the liquid flowing out of his LCD just a little faster.

In a van outside the Eikcousman residence, a woman was shouting at a man behind her and threatening him with a cup of what appeared to be very fresh and very hot coffee. 

"Next time you want to show off to Teresa and the rest of the board, fucking ASK before selling this as open beta. Do you have any idea how hard it is to fix a memory leak in reality?"

The man shook his head dumbly and turned back to his own monitor, half taken up by cameras and half by an e-mail that read "Director Hart...automatic updating of the 0.92a release is probably important...otherwise we expect things to go smoothly...PS: Friday Night Happy Hour?"
