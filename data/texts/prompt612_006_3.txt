I drifted off to the world of sleep excited, what will happen today?!

I awoke strapped to a chair, a tv in front of me. The room was bland, empty save the chair, myself, the tv, and a tv stand. I twitched in panic and heard a click, the tv flew to life and on the tv was me, well not me in the strictest sense of the word, parallel versions of yourself get confusing. 

The me in the tv looked disheveled, longer beard and longer hair. I see he's seething with rage and he starts to scream.

"I enjoyed this at first, little stints of myself being braver than I normally would. I'd come back and people would look at me different, as if I was a greater person. Now? Now I grow tired of it. What do you want? Why have you done this to me? Why the muppets? WHAT WAS THE HONEY FOR AND WHY DOES MY WIFE HATE PENGUINS NOW?!" The me in the tv was seething, his cheeks flush from rage, like me his ears became a deeper shade of red to the rest of him. Wow he must be really mad. He took a deep breath and regained his composition, though the ears remained flushed. "You like toying with lives so here, my life is now a game, and you are the player." 

At this point a wall panel opened and a computer terminal came from the space. What the hell have I done? How did I... he....me? How did he/I do this? What is this me capable of?

"On the wall is a computer terminal. I am hoping that you understand me well enough, you've been toying with my life for some time. This will be a series of trials starting with the terminal on the wall. The trials will be attempted only by you, I will remain still until you regain control. I hope you remember the honey incident, that is your first clue."

The tv abruptly shut off and disappeared into a panel in the ceiling. What the fuck did I do to make his wife hate penguins? How do I get out of this?



I am new to this so give me all the praise/criticism you can! May get deleted soon
