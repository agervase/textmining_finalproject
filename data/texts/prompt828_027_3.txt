When I died I knew I wasn't worthy of the pearl gates. I hadn't lived a good life and I sure didn't have any noteworthy accomplishments. Hell was where I knew I was going for better or worse. A life of selfishness was all I had to show for my time on Earth. What no one ever tells you about dying is how clearly you see the world. Death unlocks knowledge and understanding that a mortal body could never harness.

When I got to the underworld it wasn't quite what I expected. There was no multitude of people, there wasn't even any fire threatening to harm me. Instead of that there was only desert as far as the eye could see. The only thing that stood out was a lone figure playing the harmonica. The melancholy notes drifted across the barren expanse. 

Although I never talked to him, I knew immediately that I was listening to the wistful tunes of Lucifer himself. The loophole to get out wasn't new, it had always been there. Hell was created for the punishment of evil, but it was never meant to punish humanity. It was a cage designed to show everyone what the result of disobeying God was.

As I continued to look at the fallen angel, I could sense the solitude that he had gone through. The musical notes communicated the feelings of anguish that had come from being alone since the dawn of time.

When you're dead you lose track of time, it ceases to be important. I didn't know how long I had been listening to the music but I needed to go. Before I did, he looked up and caught my eye. In that instant I knew that Heaven might not be as wonderful as I had heard. As I began to ascend I wondered if meeting the Almighty was something worth doing. Did the heavenly creations serve God out of love or fear?
