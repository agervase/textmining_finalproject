It all happened 40 years ago.

Deep into my early 60s my memory fades day by day. But, I'll never forget that moment 40 years ago.

That moment was when life turned to death, the sweet scents turned to carrion stenches, the hallucinated utopia turned to a burning reality and when my innocence turned to corruption.

They say forgive but never forget.

I did neither.

You know what I did?

You'll know soon enough. 

They're coming.

I know it.

A knock on the door.

"Open up,' the man said,"it's the police."

Here they are. What took them so long? Do they know how 40 years even feel like? 40 years of pain, 40 years of sadness, 40 years of solitude and what else?

Oh! 40 years of flashbacks.

I wore my strong perfume over my turpentine drenched tuxedo and took my favorite lighter.

From how many years ago that lighter was from?

You guessed it!

40.

A pattern is emerging here. You see it right? They saw it too.

The knocks started to get stronger, then they became pounding, later on hammering, then it was bashing and suddenly it stopped.

I could hear a thump and knew they kicked it down.

3 in their blue uniform and all well dressed, as I am, for the death upon them.

"Magnus, you are under arrest for the murder of a number of people and for arson of dozens of houses more," the most senior of them proclaimed.

I took out my lighter.

"Sir, I demand you to drop that lighter and lay down on the ground with your hands on your head or you will force me to shoot."

Little did they know my house was filled with turpentine too.

"I am warning you sir."

I flicked open the weapon and aroused the flame.

"I'm going you one last chance sir."

You should've killed me earlier.
