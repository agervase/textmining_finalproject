"Hello."

Not normally a message that should convey a feeling of alarm, especially when spoken calmly and kindly.

Bloody hell, did it ever not fit the case.

Alexander didn't understand what was freaking this poor fellow out.  He practically clutched the window in fear.  In fear of him.  This was...  Confusing.

"Um.  Can I sit here?"

The freaked out one slowly nods, yes.

"You seem, um, kinda stressed out, dude.  Are you ok?"

The freaked out one shakes his head, no.

"I'm...  not very good with conversations, but I'm taking some classes at the university to help me with that.  So, um.  Hi.  I'm Alex.  I've noticed you on this bus a lot, and I thought you...  damn, this is hard...  I thought you looked cute."

The other starts banging his head against the window of the bus.  "I knew it...  I knew it...  I shouldn't have gone with the budget model..."

"Um.  What does that mean?"

He gets a response in the form of a shout.  "It means the cloak doesn't work!  The illusion weave doesn't *fucking* work!"

Leaning against the window, he weeps into his arm.  "I just..."

Alexander tries to place his arm on the crying man's shoulder.  It's thrown off.  "You shouldn't be able to see me in this!"

"Uh, what do you mean, dude?"

He seems to mime holding up something.  "This!  An illusion weave cloak.  I should be invisible..."

"Well, I can see you, and if it's any consolation..."  Alex wiggles his eyebrows.  "I like what I see."

"No one likes me..."

Alexander leans back and shrugs.  "Well, maybe they just don't know you."

There's a growl.  "No one knows me.  Not my mother, my father, my whole family, everyone around me...  Damnit, they didn't even notice I was gone...  Just constant verbal abuse...  If I just didn't have to be seen...  I could hide away from it all till I learned enough..."

"Studying for something?"

"I...  I hide in the back of classrooms, observing.  I like computers...  They don't judge you."

"Huh.  I'm a computer engineering major.  Pretty much the safest option for me.  I'm really colorblind.  And I enjoy the puzzles it through at you."

"You're...  colorblind?  Ha...  Ha ha ha..."

"What's so funny?"

"I'll bet...   I'll bet that's why you can see through this illusion weave...  Damnit..."

"Hey bud, don't be so upset.  Life is too short to worry too much.  And if it's any consolation," Alexander winks again.  "I think you're really cute."

"Even with the stench?  I lay down a stink bomb here every time I ride to keep away others."

Alexander taps his nose.  "I'm on four different antihistamines and I still can't smell a damn thing.  Never noticed.  Tissue?"  He offers a tissue which is gladly accepted.  He rubs the back of his head.  "So, um...  You doing anything tonight?  Cause I think I'd like to get to know you."

The freaked out one smiles, and shudders, and cries.  Alexander reaches over, and his hand is brushed away.  "It's fine.  It's fine.  I just haven't smiled in so long."

He raises his hand.  "I'm Jeffery, and I'd love to.  And...  I think you're really cute too."
