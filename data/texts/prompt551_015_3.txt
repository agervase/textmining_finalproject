"Ah good. Nice of you to finally join us James" said the figure garbed in black robes and he checked his watch impatiently. His face was obscured, it was almost if the cloak had nothing if it but darkness. "Wait am I dead?" "Yes James. You are dead, and about damn time too your stupid family had to keep you on life support for three months making me have to wait around for your lame ass I got places to be man, my boss is already on my ass about all the overtime." I nodded,  memories of everything coming back to me, my life, my friends and family, my girlfriend and my dog, and the accident that claimed my life, as I slipped on some dropped ice cream and fell headfirst into the rhino enclosure. I felt strangely... calm; I suppose Is the right word for it. I had never feared death, sure I didn't want it to come any sooner than the next guy, but I knew it was an inevitability and had accepted that. It was just that, I expected to react a little bit more to the confirmation of my fate. Maybe some crying, some anger, some begging for one last moment with my girlfriend, my dog Mango, who would never understand why his favorite pillow would never come back. But I experienced none of that. 

"So,l" I said "what now? Are you gonna harvest my soul or something" I said gesturing to the scythe in its hands. 

"Hm? Oh this thing? No it's not for harvesting souls, though I do understand why you would think that. No James, the road to the afterlife is a road across the most evil place in existence, my job is to protect you, and make sure you get to the other side without being bothered by those who lurk on the evil." 

"Oh. And who are those? Demons? Trying to tempt me with eternal life or whatever in return for eternal torture?" 

"No, no demons, no devil, just a whole lot of fucking corn"
