*Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you're here with us at Stonehenge. Are you ready...for a Spell Battle?*

*Leading us off: Merlin "DJ Merle" Am...BROSIUS!*

    The most legendary wizard around: fabled
    The resourceful sorcerer behind the round table
    Apprentices approach me saying “Gah, sir
    Is it true you the one who made King Arthur”
    Magic user #1, killin' dragons just for fun
    Brighter than the sun, and I ain’t even begun 
    Immortal, invincible, you know I got no weakness
    The only thing that hurts me is you spittin' your weak ish
    Ain't no one in the world that's up to my caliber
    Slay nerds with my words, sharper than Excalibur
    No idea what kinda impression you gonna make
    When I toss you outta here to the Lady of the Lake
    Can't believe these dudes out here with so much at stake
    Nowhere near my level, call ‘em "Morgan le Fake"
    Cast complexities with such ease, pssh, wizard please
    I'm known 'round the globe...you ain't fit to touch my robe

*Whoooo! Alright, alright! Next up, it's MC Double G - Gandalf the Grey!*

    Ayo, you know I'm legit - I'm a capital G 
    Magic from outta this dimension, see 
    My flow's so phat it'll make your pants rip
    And hold on to your butts, 'cause that was just a cantrip
    People askin', how come all these fools be runnin' 
    'Cause it's the third day, so look for my comin' 
    Saved Middle Earth so easy - ayo, I don't give a fuck
    But what the hell have you done, you fool of a Took?  
    I run with elves, so damn powerful it's eerie
    Your rhymes like the balrog - got me so damn weary
    First in my class, gonna take you to school
    Imma hand you yo ass, so fly, you fool
    The best, future and past, toss you down a crevasse
    Trapped in a morass, from which *you shall not pass*

*Ohhhh shit! It's heatin' up! Now we just got this third MC, who has been making some serious noise - give it up for Raistlin "the Wraith" Majere*

    Unh, unh, enter me 
    So OG, I'm straight D&D
    I'm thin, golden skin, came all the way from Krynn
    And this is a battle that you know Imma win
    Can't believe these weak clowns y'all makin’ me face here
    Unnaturally strong, they call me a real "Force of Majere"
    Yo lyrics so stupid gonna get me in a rage here
    Where's some real opponents? Can I get a mage, here?
    If and when you find them, just go ahead and page us
    I'll pop a cap in they ass with my Staff of the Magius 
    Ayo, the top spot's outta reach, you fools grasp for it like Tantalus
    My flow'll bust you in the face, I ‘ll punch you with my Fistandantilus
    I've come home for my throne, so suckas get back 
    Your time is over, lights out - I'm sayin' **dulak** 
    Leave you lyin' there dead, yo' words have no effect, foo’
    Iced like a glacier - not even I can resurrect you 
    I'm a never endin' snake and my bite's so venomous
    Y'all better run when you hear me start to hiss 
    Ain't a person in the universe that can even step to this
    And erryone who try, I take em right off to The Abyss 
    Straight spittin' fire, my mouth a rod just shootin’ flame
    If y'all are feelin' me, nod while’s I slay this game
    My place in the firmament is permanent, imminent, pre-eminent 
    Yo forget about Raistlin - you know that "God" is my real name
