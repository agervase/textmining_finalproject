"You'll never get away with this!" 

She could have called me scum. She could have told me that I am evil. She could have told me to fuck off. 

Nothing would ruin this moment for me. As the gentle breeze of dusk caressed her hair, a grin began to take shape on my face. 

How couldn't it? 

With the mask covering most of her face, people couldn't see how she really looked. It is kind of the point of a mask. I knew she was beautiful though, both inside and out. She always struck me as such.

I knew that she would mistake my smile for some form of savagery. Perhaps she would associate it with the the woman slowly lowering onto a vat of acid. 

However, I hoped that the field of flowers, the sunset, and the candy hearts attached to the victim's chains would make her feel the same way I did. 

"Whoever said I wanted to get away from you?" I whispered, hoping that the wind carried the words to her. "Screw it, let me tell it to her myself." 

As I began walking to her, hand outstretched to feel the smoothness of her skin, she took action. 

In the blink of an eye, she was gone already. If my own mind weren't trained so, I would not have registered the gunshot, the rattling of falling chains, and the victim's shrieks of panic. Always a step ahead of me. 

I stood there, eyes closed. Waiting for what was to come.

As my tooth flew and the taste of warm blood filled my mouth, time slowed down to a halt as I struggled to salvage every moment from this. Her knuckles were rough from years of punching. I wish I could be punched like this every time. Her bright brown eyes were unique unto themselves, like bright jewels. And while her face was transfigured into one of hate and anger, I loved every part of it. 

Another day well spent.
