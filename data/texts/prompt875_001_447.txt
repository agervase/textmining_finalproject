Most people didn’t even realize it was the zombie apocalypse until it was far too late. The medical community simply labeled it as an unknown disease that stimulated a mental disorder inducing cannibalism. But the more people began to contract the disease, the more everyone realized it was something more. Much more.

The zombies were nothing like we expected. For one, not everyone who was attacked survived, largely because a dead corpse wasn’t capable of reanimating like people used to fantasize about. This was the primary reason why the apocalypse didn’t spread overnight. Possibly only one in twenty people attacked ended up carrying on the disease. The rest died.

But that was the problem. The zombies were actually alive, which made it all the more horrible to defend yourself when dealing with people you knew.

If the beasts were capable of getting to you, then they would regress to an animalistic and predatory nature, just like one might expect of a zombie. But if they were hindered from their effort, they would become civil and use any means necessary to get you to willingly comply. Including pleading.

“Daddy, please let me in,” my daughter begged me, just outside my bedroom door. “I need you daddy. I’m scared.”

I hadn’t eaten in three days, and I had barely slept at all, largely because my recently bitten daughter hadn’t slept at all. At least I still had water in the bathroom, though it was from the toilet. I had realized almost right away that water would be my biggest necessity, especially since the power had gone out on the first day, so I’d committed to relieving myself in the bathtub instead.

My wife had never come home, so I assumed she must have stayed at work. I didn’t want to think about the alternatives. I had picked my twelve-year-old daughter up from school early because she wasn’t feeling well, only to find out she had been attacked in the bathroom by a kid much younger than her and hadn’t told anyone. Within an hour of getting home, the change had already begun happening, though I didn’t notice until it was almost too late.

When she tried to rip my throat out, I barely made it to my room in time. Since then, I had received no contact from the outside world, other than what I could see outside my window, which wasn’t encouraging. My phone and computer were both in the living room, the short distance essentially the same as being on the other side of the world.

And my daughter stayed at the door, continuing to beg for me to let her in.

“I’m sorry daddy,” she finally admitted. “I don’t want to hurt you, but I’m just so hungry! I can’t help it daddy! Please!”

It was the first time she admitted what she really wanted. Up until this point she had tried everything else. Lying, manipulating, threatening. Everything. The truth was the only thing she hadn’t tried.

“Daddy, please,” she continued. “I don’t want to be alone. At least let me bite you so we can be together.”

That gave me pause. I’d never considered such an option. I could never kill her, even if she *was* a flesh-eating monster. So then, should I just join her?

I sighed heavily, realizing I didn’t have a choice. At least, that’s what it felt like. Slowly, I crept towards the door and bent down to see my daughters vibrant red eyes on the floor peering in. She grinned when we made eye contact through the small crack. “I love you daddy!”

“I love you too,” I said breathlessly. My entire body was trembling now. I couldn’t believe I was really going to do it. The safest option would be to just stick my fingers underneath the door, risking having it bitten off, but the crack was too small. I wouldn’t even be able to fit my pinky finger. Which meant…

“Promise not to kill me?”

I heard her sigh heavily. “I’m sorry daddy, but I can’t promise you that. But you are a lot stronger than me. You can protect yourself.”

I wasn’t sure if that was true. From what I’d heard, the people infected with the disease had above average strength, but then again…she was only twelve.

I got to my feet, suddenly feeling lightheaded both from the lack of food and from the situation. Then, slowly, hesitantly…I reached up to unlock the door.

*Click.*

The handle was already trying to turn beneath my grasp.

“I love you daddy!” She called out cheerfully, shoving the door open despite my effort. She was grinning ear to ear, her vibrant red eyes excited.

I only realized then that I'd made the wrong decision.

# Part 2

Within a matter of seconds, my daughter’s grin vanished, replaced with a ferocious snarling beast. She immediately crouched down, ready to lunge for my throat. I quickly grabbed the board I had pried from my bedframe earlier and smacked her as hard as I could in the face.

Although she was certainly very strong, she was also half my weight. She smashed into the floor a few feet away.

I expected her to get back up and go at me again. Instead, she slowly pushed her upper body off the floor and looked at me innocently. “Daddy,” she whined. “That really hurt! Please don’t hit me daddy!”

“Sweetie,” I said breathlessly, “you tried to kill me again.”

She pouted. “But daddy, I’m *really* hungry. And I’m afraid to try to eat someone else. What if they hurt me?”

I kept the board up and ready, knowing she was waiting for an opportunity for me to drop my guard. “Honey, I’m sorry, but I’m not going to willingly let you eat me.”

Unexpectedly there were tears in her crimson eyes. “But daddy!” She whined again, sobbing. I waited for her to jump at me again, but she didn’t. She just laid back down and curled up on the floor crying. “Daddy,” she whispered in between sobs, “I’m really sad. And I’m scared.” She sniffled. “Won’t you please hold me?”

It pained me to see her like this, but I knew what would happen if I did. However, if I was really going to join her then I *would* have to let her bite me one way or another. It just couldn’t be the throat, or else I wouldn’t live long enough to become like her. I’d already seen on the news how gruesome a bite to the throat could be.

After a few more seconds of crying, she sniffled again and glanced up at me. “Daddy, if you aren’t going to let me eat you, then *help me.* Please! I’m afraid to try to eat someone else! Can’t you go bring someone here for me to kill?”

I stared at her in shock, too baffled to even defend myself if she tried to jump me again. But she didn’t. She waited patiently for me to respond. I flinched when she slowly sat up and folded her hands in her lap. “Please daddy? I’m just a little girl. I’m too afraid to attack someone myself, but if you bring them here for me…”

My heart was racing, even more so than when she had tried attacking me. Suddenly my hands were sweaty, and I felt light-headed again. Was she really asking me to help her kill another person? And more importantly, was I willing to do it? I mean, if I became like her then I’d probably be doing it anyway, right?

I tried to swallow the sudden lump in my throat. “Okay,” I finally whispered. “I’ll go find someone for you to eat.”

“I love you daddy!” She exclaimed cheerfully. “I’ll wait right here for you! I promise!”

I hesitated as I slowly lowered the board. But she remained seated like she said, grinning ear to ear again. I took a step towards the door. And then another. And another. She didn’t budge.

Finally, I was in the hallway, carefully backing away from my bedroom. When I got to the living room, I heard her call out again. “Please hurry daddy! I’m *really* hungry!”

I paused, deliberating my ethical dilemma. “Do they have to be alive?” I finally asked in a shaky voice.

I could hear the cheer in her voice. “Freshly killed is alright daddy! I’m not a picky eater!”

With trembling hands, I reached up towards the top of the fireplace to retrieve the small black handgun I kept hidden behind a picture of me with my daughter and wife. I gulped.

Movement from the corner of my eye caused me to jump and point the gun towards the source. She was standing in the doorway to my room, watching me impatiently. The gun wasn’t loaded yet, and as far as I knew she was well aware of that. She pouted again. “Come on daddy! Hurry! I’m *really* hungry!”

I quickly grabbed the bullets behind the loose brick, loaded the gun, and then headed for the door. When I reached for the handle, I hesitated. “I’ll be back sweetie,” I called out loudly.

“I love you daddy!” She replied from my bedroom.

I turned the handle, and opened the door.
