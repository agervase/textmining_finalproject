I was born with an empty bar on my hand that reads "XP" except only I could ever see it. People just looked at me like I was crazy. For 22 years, it never once moved. Until yesterday when I hit and killed a man on a bike. Then I understood what it meant. I sat there, a little dazed, the airbag deflating leaving a sour taste in my mouth and clinging to my nostrils. Horns were blaring at me. My windshield looked like a bunch of spider webs if only spider webs could look bloody. His bike lay mangled in the road. I got out to see if the man was okay, but it took me a minute to even find him. He was 4 cars back, with his legs bent back around his body. He wasn't wearing a helmet and his head was pouring blood onto the road. His eyes were wide open and his face had a painful expression. I gasped in horror. What had I done? And why did it feel so weird? It felt...happy. I felt powerful. I had a hard on that was harder than a diamond. I had to hold back laughter and smiles. Who was I? This wasn't me. I knew I had to call the police so I  reached for my phone and that was when I noticed something glowing. The empty bar. It was full. I stopped for a minute to realize that my XP bar was fueled by death. This feeling I'd never felt before that lit me up from my toes to the tip of my buzzed hair was a feeling I got from killing someone. I let that sink and I called for police and waited to make a statement. Their questions grew boring. How fast were you going? Did you have anything to drink tonight? Were you on your phone? Did you see him coming? The only question on my mind was: When can I do it again?
