I shook my head in disbelief. That was impossible. I had found out quickly that my latest piece of techno gadgetry was always on the slow side, but an installation that I had never authorized? Again, impossible. I tried to think of any actions I had taken, that could've triggered a download, or any browser tabs left open that may have been the culprit, but then I remembered that I had only turned the computer on one time since the funeral, and that was just to see if Tracey had left any pictures behind that could explain what had happened. Dark memories rushed in, and I tried to push the image of my oldest sister's severed head laying in a ditch off of Highway 94 out of my mind. *Dammit Tracey, what happened that night???* I immediately ruled out the browser possibility, because I hadn't had time to even connect the computer to the internet. *What is going on?* As I stared dumbfounded at the small blue and gray box, my IT experience came back to me, and I clicked on the "Start" button, and selected the highlighted option that read, "Programs." Scrolling past the all the ones I recognized, I finally came to a folder that was highlighted, called "Andromeda." I could feel my palm sweating as I navigated the mouse toward the folder and clicked on it. 

   Suddenly, a black form fell out of the air, and landed between me and the monitor, and a pair of yellow eyes stared into mine, mere inches away! I shoved backwards away from the desk, the wheels on my desk chair snagged the carpet, and I toppled onto the floor. In the same instant, hard claws dug into my back, and a loud hiss filled the air as I thrashed around, desperately trying to get away from  my attacker. "Get the hell off of me, Patch!" I yelled, grabbing nothing but a handful of fur as the American Shorthair shot across the den, and disappeared into the kitchen. *A goddamn cat, and a slow-ass computer. Thanks for the gifts, Tracey*. I stood up, righted the chair, and sat back down, pulling myself back over to the desk. The folder had opened, and my heart stopped as I saw the title of the single program inside. "TERRY - OPEN IMMEDIATELY." I looked around. *What the fuck was going on here?* I knew for damn sure that folder, and that program wasn't on this computer when I looked around on it three nights ago. So how in the hell was someone accessing my computer, that didn't even have an internet connection, and installing a program with that name? Very slowly, I maneuvered the arrow over to the program, and double-clicked on it.

   *Fucking slow computer*. After a minute of watching the mouse icon circling, the screen flickered, and a black window filled the screen. The black began to fade, and suddenly, there in living color, was Tracey. Alive. Breathing. Head still connected to her body. *Fuck.* "Hi Terry". *Fuck again.* My skin started tingling as I forced back hot tears. "There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just going to say it: I'm going to be murdered". Her voice trembled, and her normally flushed face was white as snow. "I don't have a lot of time to explain everything, and I know that I'm being watched, so I'm making this video as quickly as I can. If you are watching this, then I've already *been* murdered, and the delayed installation program I've set up on the computer I willed to you has been triggered. I need you to listen very closely". Her voice broke off, and she looked over her shoulder, like she was trying to find someone. "Last week I showed up for work at the agency, and I noticed that something was wrong. People were nervous. Looking at me funny. Going out of their way to avoid me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not popular, but I don't have many enemies. At least, I didn't. I started asking around kind of nonchalantly, trying to find out what was up. I didn't get anything the first two days, but on the third day, I started hearing rumors that something had been stolen. Something very important. Something very important that had to do with me. Something very important, that ONLY had to do with me". She was becoming more animated, and she brushed her raven colored hair back out of her face. "And then yesterday, I was called into the directors office. He point blank asked me where I had come up with the fucking moxy to pull something like this. I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He just stared at me for awhile and then told me I was a liability now, and that I needed to find another job". She broke down into tears and sobbed, "Terry, I know they think I took the formula, but I didn't! I know I'm the only one who knows the activation codes, but there must have been a mistake! Someone else must have figured it out!!" She wiped her eyes and took a deep breath. "I'm not a fool, I know what's coming. I'm a security risk now, and they won't hesitate to... Either way, I'm making this video now, because I want you to know the truth. Terry, you're the only one that can clear my name. You've got to find that formula and prove that I didn't take it. You really don't have a choice anyways, they'll be after anyone connected to me". She sighed and folded her arms. "I'm sorry, Terry. Just remember, the patch will always lead to the bird who holds arrows". The video blurred, and then disappeared.

   *The patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows? Tracey, what is going on?* My mind was reeling as the program announced that it would self-delete in 5 seconds. I had always known that my sister was part of a very small group of people who worked in the hierarchy of the NSA, but I had no idea she was high enough up to be involved in something like this. *Formulas? Patches?* What in the world had Tracey gotten herself into? I checked my watch on my way up the stairs, and decided I would try to make heads or tails out of it in the morning. It was all too much. My mind raced back and forth. *The phone call. The flashing lights. Traceys decapitated body laying in a ditch in front of a deserted semi truck, with no sign of a driver.* And now this? I clicked off the lamp next to my bed, and rolled onto my side. *the patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows*

   I sat up suddenly, my heart racing. *The patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows* I checked my watch. 2:48 am. *The patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows*. I threw the covers back, jumped out of bed, and took the stairs two at a time until I got to the den, and then I raced into the kitchen. *The patch will always lead to the bird that holds the arrows*. I fumbled in the dark for the light switch until I finally found it, and my eyes burned with the sudden brightness. *The patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows*. I tiptoed over to the small shelf next to the refrigerator and quietly layed myself down onto the floor. *The patch will always lead to the bird who holds the arrows*. Peering through the shadows, my eyes locked onto a familiar black form, staring back at me with yellow eyes. "Come here, Patch".
