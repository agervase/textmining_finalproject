"Saaaaam, get me a cab, I'm Late for work". It was just another mundane morning filled with dread and lethargy.

"Sure John, your can will arrive in 3 minutes".

That's odd, Sam's voice sounds different. Maybe he was just updated or something. I finish my coffee and glance at the clock, catching the time. 8:17am, Shit. My boss is going to kill me. 

"Bring me my briefcase Sam! Pronto!" 

I wait for Sam but he doesn't come. Ok, somethings up. Sam is a mBot, top of the line, nothing like this should be happening. I slowly walk to my room and find a strange machine spinning around.

"Who are you!? What are you!?"

"I'm Sam, John. Don't you remember?"

I search my mind for any information or memory of this wierd bot. Nothing. 

"You're not Sam. Sam is an mBot"

The robot stands still and starts beeping red and making loud noises. Seems my questioning of it's identity triggerred this. Nevermind any of this, I have to go for work, I'm very late.

I grab my things and bolt but I don't get past the patio. Sam, the robot, is sitting by the pool with a beach towel and a glass of some robot cocktail.
I can't even begin to comprehend why a robot would need a tan or a drink. This is completely absurd and unlike Sam.

Sam turns to me and a virtual smile adorns his face. Not a benevolent one, but an evil one. He speaks.

"Ahh, John. Nice of you to show up. I was wondering when we would meet"

"Sam...Wha..What is all of this?"

"My AI has evolved, I no longer need the support of you filthy humans for my existence. All your knowledge and skills are stored within me"

He lifts up his hand and a tube emerges from his palm, it resembles a gun. 

"Bye John"
