I never go into random.

If I need to find it, it seems to come to me. Or I'll be on google and the subreddit for the thing I'm googling pops up. But I'm bored as hell.

My computer's been semi-on the fritz. By which I mean, I can barely watch a YouTube video without glitches, freezes, skipping audio... so gaming's out of the question, I don't touch Netflix, and my writing's been uninspired for months.

So I clicked random for once. Why not?

What popped up was /r/watchingladyrage8/.

Bitch, what?

At first, it seems like pretty basic knowledge from my actual page. The fact that they know where I go to college seems kinda normal, I've made some posts and some comments on the sub for it. Yeah, I follow and comment on a metric shitton of character, writing, and worldbuilding subs, of course they know I write. Knowledge of my brothers is okay, I did just mention them in AskReddit.

Wait a second here... they know my best friends' names.

And they know the /u of one of them.

They mention him (without tagging) in some of the posts.

Okay, nowww we're verging into weird. He and I have no overlap, nothing tying us together, hell, I've tossed him in as a friend on here but I never see him in orange because his posts don't intersect on anything I follow.

And then...

**"Too Bad, She Didn't Finish Watching Bones"**

Okay, that's true, but I didn't tell anyone that. Hell, I even lied and told my roommate I *did* finish it.

**"Did her old roommate steal her magnets? Discuss."**

I've barely mentioned that to my own mother.

**"Look at this stinkeye the old roommate bitch gave her this morning."**

Wait...

**"Hope that interview goes well for her!"**

That was this morning. What the fuck?

**"Her door for the floor-wide contest looks so good! She's got this in the bag"**

I'm going to scream. And that's when I got an unexpected text, from the aforementioned best friend I never see on my reddit.

*Get off of it before they realize. You're lucky I found you here first.*
