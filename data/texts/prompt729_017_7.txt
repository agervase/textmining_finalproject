"Happy Birthday" he sarcastically muttered to himself, finding himself in the Knowlageterium, a compendium of all the books ever written by man. He couldn't stand it, he felt as if he lived for thousands of years by the time he was 9. Visiting this world exhausted him every night.

Each night he ended up here felt like a thousand years, and all he could do is spend time reading. He's read just about everything, from the original version of the Bible, to the Bill Clinton's Starr Report. Books that no 9 year old could read, let alone comprehend.

He wandered around for a few days, which in reality was probably a few minutes looking for a new book to read. He ventured into the erotica section, as he rarely made his way over there. 

"Something different....anything....different...." he muttered to himself. 

As he said this, he turned the corner to find a book on the floor. Books were always on shelves in the Knowlageterium, this one stood out to him. 

It was a brown, leather bound, tome of some kind. It was clearly old, if not ancient. There was designs all over the front of it, he couldn't tell what they were since it was so worn, but swore he saw a face. He examined the book even more, and noticed a white book mark in the pages, and removed it.

"Why is there a bookmark?" he asked himself, "Anyone who comes here always finishes the books they start before leaving...." 

He examined the bookmark, it was just a torn strip of paper, with something written on it. It said in big block letters to read the strip of paper before opening the book.

Little Ashley struggled, but began reading the strange words that were not English, and so he began.

"Klaatu Barada N---" he had to stop, as the slip of paper was torn in the middle of the last word. 

Ashley crumbled the slip of paper, grabbed the book, and began reading from page 1 and let out a defeated "groovy".
