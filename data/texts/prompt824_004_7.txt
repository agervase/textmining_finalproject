“**What?**”, Yahweh proclaimed. 

The words, stark and bold on the plane-screen, read:  **“The Universe™ has just run out of free trial; Subscribe for 128.95 prayers a month or pay only 600.00 prayers for a full-year subscription, or continue playing on lite version.”**

Now, Yahweh was a bit of a broke, nerdy student God, and could not afford the subscription. He was sure he could keep playing his world-build just fine even on lite version, and went for it. “I mean,” God thought, “What’s the worst that could happen? They can’t just take away my worldbuild.”


Oh how wrong Yahweh was. The Universe rebooted in front of his eyes. After a familiar load and start screen, The Universe loaded up, except… 
“Wait, where’s my save file?”


There was no ‘Continue’ option this time. The plane-screen only flashed: ‘New Game’, ‘Settings’ and ‘Exit’, with a ‘Purchase’ banner on the side. But the ‘Continue’ option was missing. 
“NO!” Please no…”, Yahweh whimpered. His complex and advanced worldbuild, full of premium features and advanced mechanics like gigantic lifeforms and primordial self-craft planets, was gone. 

Yahweh, unwilling to give up hope, selected ‘New Game’. After a series of flashes on the plane-screen, a familiar blue premade planet appeared, devoid of any progress. 

“Oh God, I have to start over?” Yahweh said. "This is bull*"

“Wait, where are my dinosaurs?”, but there were no dinosaurs or giant insects or plants in his ‘Inject Life’ tab. There was no self-creating primordial soup for the lazy play Yahweh was so fond of. Those were premium features, and the Lite version only offered lowly and uninteresting mammalians and smaller lifeforms, like rats and birds.  
Yahweh was too addicted to The Universe at this point anyway, and so instead of quitting right there and then, he instead declared, rather dejectedly, “Well, let there be Lite…I guess”.
