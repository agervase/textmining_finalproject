"Sir, we have another one."

At first, no one realized what was happening. A few people reported almost instantaneous change. Certain people were instantly changed, but they went largely unnoticed in the western world. Politicians from Britain and America lead the change. Slowly, people realized that people travelling abroad were changing.

"Sir, we have to tell the world. Our economy is in shambles."

Governments ranging from China to Mexico started banning travel, fearing an unknown infectious disease. Wikileaks announced that the American CDC was to blame. A coalition of nations starting with Italy was embargoing America, demanding that they close their borders and release information about the new biological weapon.

"Sir, it will be fine. People will understand."

When President Trump announced that people were turning blonde due to their own stupidity, the international balance of power started to shift. No longer were third world nations willing to buy from the west. Everyone started to assume that China and India had the most reliable fulfillment capabilities for contracts.

"Sir, I do not think that will work."

I had just invented a hair dye that could bypass the new tests developed by Taiwan - it turns out, once we lost our power Asia united under a system akin to the old European Union, and China was keen on making sure no one impersonated brilliance.

"Sir, our agent has reported back."

We kept the dye a secret- if the world knew about it, they would simply devise a new device to detect it. I urged the President to allow us to use it for espionage to determine the root cause. Trump insisted on using it himself, but we managed to convince him otherwise.

"Sir, how could this be?"

The official debrief from our spy reported only one thing: "We did it."

Two years after I invented the dye, the investigation into the source of the disease was found. President Trump had funded a team to solve racism. The team had managed to change global racial hierarchies by making dark haired people perceived as the most capable.

Edit: Minor text fixes. Thanks y'all for the positive response. I had fun writing it - not often struck by any creative thoughts for these so I'm glad to be able to contribute this time... Maybe it's because I'm on vacation right now. Hopefully it continues.
