*"Minster of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, declared today that the Canada Goose is no longer protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act."*


Brian looked up at the wall-mounted TV broadcasting CP24's breaking news and nearly dropped the cup of double-double Timmies he was warming his hands with. "It's about time!" he muttered to himself. "Asshole birds who think they own the road..."


Last summer, Brian had nearly lost his job because a flock of the patch-faced shitmachines decided it was a great time to slowly herd their obnoxiously yellow goslings across the 401, bringing the busy highway to a complete standstill. During rush hour. Needless to say, there were a lot of very disgruntled Torontonians that day. As the minister talked about culling measures that the Canadian Wildlife Services would began enacting in the spring when the birds returned, Brian turned to daydreams of a Toronto whose sidewalks would be free of green, slimy goose droppings. The double-double tasted sweeter than normal.

*Is Justin Trudeau the new Harper?* wondered the front page of the Metro. Brian raised an eyebrow at the stack of newspaper and reached to grab one...only to get bowled over by someone with a huge bag. Swearing, he caught himself and turned to glare at the back of the retreating bag owner. 


"Not even an apology. Kids these days!" he huffed to himself.

Spring arrived, and the geese returned from their winter spent in warmer climes. As was now customary, Brian steeled himself for the angry hisses that the neighborhood geese couple greeted him with every time he walked within 100 meters of their nesting area. It wasn't his fault they chose to nest so close to the sidewalk, damn it!


He turned the corner and witnessed a miracle. Kids were playing near the geese, who were quietly swimming with their goslings in the park's small pond. A neat pile of droppings was arranged under a tree. Brian stopped and stared in pure disbelief at the sight. Somehow, those geese had turned into proper, polite Canadian citizens. 


"EXCUSE ME!" A voice said angrily to him. Brian jumped about a foot in the air and came down to face the red-faced woman. "Are you staring at my kids, you pedophile?!"


"I'm looking at the geese, you cunt!" Brian snarled back. "Not at the pack of screaming monkeys you call your kids!"


After he got home, Brian reflected that maybe he didn't need to go for a run that evening.

Several months later, Brian cheered when he picked up the morning's Globe and Mail to read:
