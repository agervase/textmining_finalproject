An excerpt from *on the efficiency of magic* by Beverly Brine

Much as a candle burnt for light still produces heat, so too does the use of magic radiate excess energy. This has always been a concern of mine. 

Despite our liberal use of magic, we still know very little about it. We do not know where this energy comes from; we do not know if it is a finite resource; and we do not know what effect this magic radiation, which I will refer to in this essay as runoff, has on us and our environment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that areas with high runoff, such as magic schools, experience higher windspeeds, increased plant growth, and the disappearance of small items. 

We send our children to these places from the age of five, yet our government has repeatedly denied funding for research into these phenomena. One wonders what tragedy we must endure before such issues cannot be ignored. 

This essay will detail what we know and what we must know.

Project 1: Max Efficiency

It is well known that the more experienced a person is with magic, the less runoff is produced. Conventional wisdom has stated, however, that it is impossible to achieve 100% efficiency. 

I am no longer convinced of this. 

Recently while shopping for supplies in town, I happened upon what I mistook at first for a simple beggar. In front of her was a small table, upon which sat a deck of cards, a few coins, three small cups and a ball, and a hat.

What I experienced both terrified and thrilled me. 

She claimed to be from a distant land called "The Bronx". Over the next 10 minutes, she displayed feats of mind reading; teleportation and duplication of simple objects; and the conjuration of a rabbit. 

There was not a *single* drop of runoff. When I demanded to know how she had accomplished this, she simply told me "a magician never reveals her secrets".

I plan to travel to this "Bronx", and attempt to learn how this is possible, but I will require a research grant to do so.
