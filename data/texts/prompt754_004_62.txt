"What do you mean this isn't our planet?" Commander S. demanded angrily. The euophoria that had been at her finger tips for 500 years suddenly vanished like fire in space.

"I'm sorry ma'am, at Omnitropolis, we distribute just planets to retailers, we don't sell directly to customers."

"Well, did you at *least* find us a replacement planet, Hmm?" She recovered and countered the refusal like a pilot avoiding rapid fire. "We were guaranteed this planets by right of succession of the Kingdom of Atomopolis Inc!" 

"I'm sorry, We did not. I've never heard of them and they're certainly not one of *our* manufacturers.  If you don't have a voucher I can't just give you a planet. If you want to get in store credit just turn left and y -" 

"Then gets us a replacement!" She cut back. The indecency of their actions made clear on her face, and she knew it. These *jerks* weren't going to take *their* stake without a replacement with one of equal or greater value! *How  did they not recognize the validity to her righteous claim? The great AI be willing, this planet* ***would*** *be hers!*

"*Lady,* I can't-"

***"DON'T*** *you* ***LADY*** *Me!"* She spat, jabbing that bastard in in the chest with a finger. "You need to go find us a replacement planet right *now!*" 

"I... I have to call my manager, can you please take a seat?"

"If you think a piece of comfortable furniture will **PLACATE MY WRATH**... you are sorely mistaken! I carry the burden of a generation, nothing short of an Earth2.5 will stop me from succeeding my mission!"

"Excuse me, Boss?"

*"Nothing!"*

 "You're needed at the lobby as soon as possible. No, it's not really an emergency, but-"

**"YES, THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!"**

"You hear that? Uh-huh. Yup. Uh huh. Okay, gotcha. Alright Ma'am, they've elevated your ticket to HR. *In the mean time* please take this gift card, it's complementary, you can shop for civilizations in the omnitorium while Mr. Omnitron makes his way down." The smile looked about as fake as their inheritance on the secretary's face as they begrudgingly followed the path to the right. *There's not his problem anymore*
