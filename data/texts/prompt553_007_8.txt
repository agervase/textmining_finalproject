  

We had been doing this for quite some time.

Sam, my life, love and everything, brought me back to existence for every special occasion—the holidays, the Superbowl, job promotions and of course our own very special Sundays. He wrote me every time for at least three years about how impossible it was to do without. I didn’t know a man fix his mouth to say ‘I’m so sorry’ as often as he did.

I sat on my knees in the closet, lights off, staring at a shoebox. This shoebox started as what it was… a shoebox. In it was the last pair of high heels I bought before I died. They happened to also be the same ones I wore on our last dinner date. I couldn’t remember quite when it started, but eventually the shoes were replaced by items Sam collected throughout his life that reminded him of me. Month by month I opened it up to something new. Whether it was a pearl necklace, a seashell or an old photo, it soon would start to make my stomach churn. Now, I was filling it up with his notes.

Finally, it caught my eye. Our very first note, marked with a big, bold ‘X’.

“*My love Jessy,*

*You live in my head, both literally and metaphorically and to know that you are still there causes me a great deal of pure, raw emotion. I know you are asleep now, and can’t see me writing this, so yes… this is your gift for our anniversary, a surprise!”*

In my head, I heard him laughing faintly. A video-reel of my eyes flying open that following morning to real life was playing. I had never been so damn scared in my life. If you think dying is a scary, imagine becoming *undead*.

“Babe, I still can’t believe to this day that spell worked! If *I* was the pilot, I would be bawling right now!”

I forced a smile and picked my voice up a notch. “Me too, babe. 

“Now, I need you to head downstairs. Being it’s our ten-year anniversary, I got you something super special,” he closed off with another laugh. “I wish I feel your face when you see it! With those little cheekbones!” 

Sam continued gushing as I made way down the stairs. Most of my responses were simple ‘mhmm’s and ‘yeah’s. There was not much to say to a man who carried you around all day in his twisted mind. Through the never-ending static of his voice, I made a pit-stop in my crafting room. It was left 100% intact since the day I died. He was prying about what I was doing and I simply told him it was *my* anniversary present to him.

Lights on, all the lights on, black paper and a white pen for clarity and… dramatic effect?

I started to write with my eyes wide open. I told him, “This is for you,” and continued to read aloud as I wrote.

“*Sam,*

*You are man whose life I can truly say that I have lived. I have watched you climb the ladder at your firm. I have watched you make new friends and take interest in new hobbies. We toured Italy together, like we always wanted to. Want to know something else? I knew this was your plan.*

*You killed me, Sam, and you can’t deny that. I know it was you following me home that night. I can hear you denying this right now... shut the hell up. I have lived in your sick mind for the past 10 years, so I know you. I’d go so far to say that I am you (if I were a murderer)… but no, I am* like *you. Dead inside, a husk of their self and desperate for something.*

*Anyway, I’d give you more, I know you’re begging for this sort of thing, but all I must say is that this consciousness is mine, now. I will be in contact with the Administration of Magic to ensure you will be tried for your vile crime against my life and, in the meantime, will be healing my mind at the facility so you are not here and instead in silence and darkness, awaiting your fate.*

*You disgust me, Sam Alder. Soon I will be myself again. Good luck killing me for a third time.*

*Jessy* *~~Alder~~*  *Kane.”*

Idk if this long or whateva first time outchea but need to get back to writing! Neat-o idea.
