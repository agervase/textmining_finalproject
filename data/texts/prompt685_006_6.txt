It had been twenty minutes since the announcement, the relations between Russia and the US and fallen into ruin. The attempt on the president’s life was unsuccessful and the news reports the last few weeks has said that the Russians were at fault. The president as dumb as he was demanded that Russia apologize. Russia said they had no knowledge of any operation and denied the attack. As a result, he decided to declare war. The government had decided to give all residents 4 hours to prepare for global nuclear war.
Unfortunately for us in Canada that meant we had to follow suit as many of Russia’s and the US’s nukes would be flying overhead and the US defense system would most likely detonate them in orbit over us. The US had closed their land borders with us to stop people from fleeing south and armed them with military to keep them shut.

“Uncle why are all the signs rainbows?” said the youngest on my shoulder

“Adult stuff, don’t worry about it.” I replied while quickening our haste

“Slow down, where are we going.” said the oldest dragging my arm

“To the subway.” I said picking him up in my arms

“Where’s my mommy.” the middle child asked me

“She’s on vacation remember.” I replied holding back tears

“But Uncle, I want to go back to the store.” the oldest said

“Me too.” said the youngest

“I want daddy.” said the middle child

“We can go back to the store tomorrow. Now we are going to my house to play” I said with an authoritative tone

 My nephews were visiting me in the City this week. Their parents wanted to go on a cruise in the Caribbean. Lucky for them I guess, they would be spared this nightmare while I kept watch over their kids. Luckily for me I lived in B5 of and old parking garage. Once automated cars were standardized all the old parking structures were turned into condos. My friends thought I was crazy buying what was essentially an underground bunker. I knew better.

“Uncle can we play that old game with the red guy” said the oldest

“You mean Mario? Sure.” I said feeling slightly old

“Yes!” the oldest said in a triumphant cheer

“Us too Uncle” said the middle and youngest almost simultaneously

“Sure, you can all play whatever you want all night” I said hoping it would keep them distracted thought the coming storm.
***
Thankfully as the “crazy person” I was I bought a generator fission generator back in ’26. They died out fairly quickly due to the previous government tension dying down quickly, but those things were tested to last 10 years without needing any servicing at full load. Considering what I do for a living and the deal I got I thought it would be great for power outages. At this point I was wishing that the subway would go faster as it would take us about an hour to get home.

“Go play kids, have all the snacks and fun you want. I’ll be in the farm if you need me.” I said

“All of the snacks” said the middle one

“Yes, all of them.” I said

“Yay!” the kids said running off to the other side of the apartment
***
To work I went, tearing my precious plants out of the hydroponics farms and replacing them with some of the wheat and tomato seeds I had kept stored for the off season. I had to get these planted before the bombs hit and the generator turned on. I would have to ration the power between the sides of the house and the water filter. An hour went by before I had all the plants planted. Suddenly I heard knock at the door.

“Uncle, we ate all the snacks we could reach but we are hungry again.” The oldest said with those puppy dog eyes only kids can pull off

“All of them? All ready? I guess it is supper time anyways. What time does the rainbow say now?” I said picking some potatoes out of the farm

“It says 0134.” the oldest said almost soldier like

“Ask your brothers how steak and potatoes sounds, ill be right out” I said approaching the sink

“Really, steak? Like from a cow?” the oldest said 

“Yes, like from a cow.” I said

“Wow, mom never lets us have steak. She says its expensive and hard to get.” the oldest said almost enthralled at the idea of eating meat.
***
I never understood why their mother didn’t let them have real meat at least once a month I know its been expensive since the outbreak of ’22 but those protein pills were disgusting. Regardless I needed to get rid of it. I would have to unplug the fridge once the power went out and I had 4 steaks in there. No need to waste $300 worth of meat. I usually treated them to a real burger every time they were here anyways.
***
“Hi kids.” I said passing though the decontamination door

“Hi Uncle” they said

“Are you really making us steak” the youngest said cheerfully

“Have I ever lied to you before.” I said

“No but he has.” the youngest said pointing at his brother

“I don’t like steak.” the middle child said

“Now we both know you’ve never had steak.” I said, “And I bought this just for you.”

“Okay.” the middle child said reluctantly

“I promise you will love it” I said
***
I had planned to make the best damned steak I would ever make, as it would most definitely be my last. Thankfully the kids wouldn’t know the difference, so I fast fried theirs and spent the most amount of time making sure mine was perfect. We wouldn’t have much time to eat after all.

“Okay, did everyone enjoy their food?” I said proudly

“Wow.” said the youngest

“I still don’t like it.” said the middle child

“Real meat is great” said the oldest “Can we have more some other time?”

“Remember what your mom said” I reminded the oldest

“Aww okay” the oldest whined

“Who wants to watch a movie? We can watch it really loud with popcorn” I said

“Can we watch one of those old DVE’s you always like?” said the oldest

“Sure, how about Star Wars?” I said excited that the kids were interested in old movies

“Can we watch the one with the funny frog guy and dumb robots” the middle child said

“Yeah.” I said regretfully
***
We sat down to watch the movie. As we sat down I noticed the time on the “rainbow” said 15 minutes, wonderful. As I flicked the input source over to my Blu-ray player I turned the volume up too. If I’m going out watching a shit movie I’m going out deaf. Excited the kids gathered on the couch. All I could think was their ignorance would be their bliss.
***
“Uncle why can you touch your TV?” the youngest said

“Because its old, remember, its older than you are” I said feeling exceedingly old now
***
It had begun. As the opening crawl rolled by all I could think of was how bad I felt for these kids. The wouldn’t be able to enjoy growing up as I did. We would all be stuck in this house forever, or worse. We wouldn’t be. We felt the rumble but I told the kids it was just the speakers. They seemed to believe me.

Sometimes I look back on that day, remembering the panic in the streets, us Canadians thinking this was it, the Americans had sacrificed us to save themselves. Thankfully for us their nuclear defense system was a dud and all the launched nukes sailed perfectly to their target and detonated on impact. All this did for Canada was ruin some of our limited exterior crops and cause some radioactive hot zones in our near border cities. Our government did breakdown in the hours prior to the drop however. The people decided it would be smarter for the provinces to just look after themselves and trade when needed.
***
The kids were reunited with their parents after a year, their cruise ship was off the coast of Puerto Rico when the alarm went up. The Captain, being a smart man diverted the ship towards Venezuela and the passengers all pitched in to buy enough fuel to get to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They still visit sometimes. I give them some potatoes and onions when they are over. Sadly, beef is too far out of my price range to share anymore.
***
Unfortunately for the US with the borders closed it didn’t just stop us from fleeing south. It stopped them from fleeing north and most of the Americans were either vaporized on impact and the ones that did survive were executed by their military for “deserting their country”. I never did understand the Americans scorched earth style patriotism. But this was just stupid.
***
I however went back to my life, minus the beef obviously, I was fine living the way I was before, and business was booming now as I was the only farmer in my area to have a farm unaffected by the fallout spread. I managed to barter for the two levels above me. Promising the previous tenants a supply of food and jobs to keep them going. I still work every day and as a good Canadian I try to give back to some of the more unfortunate that lost everything in the hot zones.
