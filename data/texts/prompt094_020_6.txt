The darkened sky looked eerily like a solar eclipse as the alien craft maneuvered itself across the Atlantic Ocean easterly towards the United States.  
  
The evacuation calls came weeks earlier. For the first time in over a hundred years, there were less an a million people in NY city. A ghost town of epic proportions.   
  
In a small, almost invisible tan camo tent setup near a beach, a group of 5-6 Army personnel stood around a wooden box.  
   
*General Branch's fingers shook as his hand hovered over the metal gear*.  
  
The box has been handed down in secret to every major power. The first textual evidence of the box came from the Roman era. There were pyramid drawings in Southern America depicting a monster as the reason of  the mass cities disappearing, practically over night. Without a clue as to what caused it. Through all the horrible tragedy, historians found one thing in common. Whenever the world was going to experience a catastrophic event, the major ruling power would use this box. It caused major devastation, but ultimately saved the planet. They theorized that the monster was just a representation of the power behind the box.  
  
Since the box was never found, and no pictures of its innards has ever been found, it garnered more attention from History Channels 'Ancient Aliens', than it did from the historian community. Little did experts or most people know though, the box was real. Not some myth painted on a pyramid wall, or a story in an ancient roman text.   
  
Before the Alien craft signal was picked up by NASA, 4 people in the world knew the box existed.   
  
When the President handed General Branch the plain wooden box, Branch thought it was weird. It looked old, but from the outside, the wooden box seemed unremarkable.  
  
"General Branch, this is the best kept secret of the entire world. If the Alien ship invades earth's airspace, you must use this box. When this secret was handed to me, this is only piece of directions that the last president gave me." The President glances at the ground, as if in thought, then, as if programmed to do so, in the most monotone voice, "To save all of earth, open this box, and align the gear to the current date."  
  
*"Weird", Branch mumbles under his breath skeptically.*  
  
Then as if the President snaps out of the trance, "I don't know what will happen General, Godspeed though. May god save us all."  
  
*All General Branch has left to do is put in the year '18' on the last gear. "Is it some kind of time power? why a date? Will I die when whatever this does goes off?" The fingers shake...*  
  
*General Branch turns the last gear to read '18', and freezes afraid to move a muscle, looking around to see if anything happened.*  
  
3 long minutes pass, the Alien craft slowly getting bigger on the horizon.  
  
"Well?" one of the Generals finally says.  
  
*"I don't know" Branch thinks to himself, his hands drop from being inside the box*  
  
With a loud bang, almost as loud as gunshot, the box slams shut. When the loudness subsides, the generals start to hear a low rumble. The ground shakes. The waves in the distance, seconds ago crashing against the beach, now calm as if someone took all of the energy from the ocean.  
  
*General Branch pulls up his binoculars, focusing on the alien craft as it moves towards them, like an unstoppable force.*  
  
Then it stops.  
  
"The craft just stopped ,sir!", General Raelor yells, still hearing the ringing from the box slamming.   
  
Almost as if General Raelor summoned a demon with those innocuous words, tentacles started rising from the ocean right under the alien craft. All of the generals shout over each other.  
    
"Is that an octopus?!"  
"it can't be, its too big, that has to be the biggest squid ever?!"  
  
*"Its not a squid" General Branch calmly explains, instantly quieting the loud group. General Branch's brain was going a mile a minute.*  
  
*"There is an old story, about a monster that lives in the depth of the Pacific Ocean. But it was a fiction book in the 20's."*
  
The green monster rising from the ocean, looked incredibly similar to the drawings in the book. The tentacles were followed by arms, then a normal like body, albeit larger than most *buildings*.   
  
*General Branch had no idea how the box was connected to a 1920s fiction story. What lay before his eyes, through the binoculars though, was a Cthulu Monster rising out of the water and reaching up to grab the Alien craft.*   
  
The group was speechless.  
  
Cthulu rose up out of the water, further and further until its arms could reach around and grab the ship. The monster finding a grip, starts to pull the craft down.  
  
The wind hit the group first, then a strange deep bellowing voice could be heard from Cthulu,  
  
"Hastur, you will not force your evil upon this planet!"   
  
The ship, never released any of its weapons, at least nothing the Generals could see. Cthulu pulled and pulled until the massive craft sank below the surface.  
  
*"I thought this thing was supposed to devastate us, while it saves us..." the words barely escapes General Branch's mouth, when he sees the ocean in his binoculars.*  
  
The wall of water was already well over the height of any NY city building.
