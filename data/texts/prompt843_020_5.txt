I could barely see that sickly, green, glowing number out of the corner of my eye. It was hardly ever clearly visible, just hanging perpetually in my periphery. To be fair to that eyesore of a number, I'd wondered why it had been so high all day. I didn't even notice it until I'd sat down to a quick breakfast, almost ready for work. I found it odd that it read 7212. Seven thousand, two hundred and twelve. I had lived this exact day seven thousand, two hundred and twelve times. 

My heartbeat had quickened. Why? Why had I reset this day so often? I hardly ever choose to reset anything. At most I'd reset a day four or five times. Seven thousand? What is happening today to make that happen? Panic set in. Something amazing? Something terrible? My heart pounded in my chest. *Is this it?* I had wondered. *Do I nearly die of a heart attack and am forced to reset so I can live indefinitely?*

My wife's calming voice had brought me out of my anxiety. I forced a smile back at her, we kissed softly, then I hurried off to work, throwing her a cursory "I love you", and catching her "you too". Then the rest of the day had gone on as normal. Until 3:12pm. That's when my cell phone rang from an unknown number. I'd found it odd that someone was actually calling it. Who does that anymore? The hospital, apparently. 

The woman in the ICU was not my wife as I knew her. Her smile was gone, replaced by the blank expression of a coma patient. Her face was bruised and cut, not its usual smooth, well cared for self. Cuts, scrapes, and bruises were intermittent along the extremities I could see outside the gown. I did not doubt that it hid even more damage. 

Tears ran down my face as the doctor prattled on about what happened. I caught pieces of it as my mind raced. Accident, driving, comatose, not good, sincerely, rest, unlikely. I knew what he meant. She was gone. And she might never come back. My tears blurred that damnable number in the corner of my vision. I could barely see that sickly, green, glowing "7212". I finally understood why. 

"I know it's hard," the doctor told me. "But we're going to do everything we can. I can't guarantee that it'll make her better though." *No*, I thought. *It might not make her better, but I can.*

At breakfast, I notice that the number in my periphery reads 7213.
