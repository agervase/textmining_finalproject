It is 8:15pm. Everyday around this time I felt weak, anxious & exhausted. Not because of the day I'm having or anything. But for what to come next. For what its worth, a year of productivity I'm about to experienced in 60 seconds.  

You heard that right. A year worth of productivity in 60 seconds.  

All of this started when I accidentally dropped a coin in a so called magic lake. I remember that moment vividly. It was night of new moon. It was so dark & quiet. I was on vacation that time & the local folk tell the story of the magic lake that granted wish. I pay those no mind but still, I wanted to see the lake. As I watched the coin sinking, I noticed some flare of light & thunder blasting from the lake's surface. There it is. A genie. Not your normal Disney genie but a Pokemon genie. A [Thundurus](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/b/b8/642Thundurus.png/250px-642Thundurus.png) to be exact. I know that because of the lightning & thunder appears in the surrounding & I'm a pokemon fan myself.  

"Ye Son of Adam! Merry meet & bless upon thee!"

"Bless be." I replied.

"Thy have summoned me.."  

"Can you talk normally? Like *this time* normal?" I cut it off & request something that I thought was futile.  

"Its 2017. Cryptic words are creepy." I continued.

"What have you got to call me in the middle of the night, dude?"  

I'd be damn. This genie is the real deal. It adjusted the way it speaks just as easy. What sorcery am I witnessing right now?  

"I don't know. Them people told me this lake granted wishes."

"They're right & wrong. This lake is my house. I'm the one that granted wishes. You dig?"  

"Say, you can granted any wishes?" I asked.  

"I can & I will. Ask away"  

"I wanted to be so productive this year. I wanted to get all of my stuff done as perfect as possible. I wanted a year worth of productivity in 2017!!"  

"Your wish is my command!" as the genie finish talking, it raised its left arm & strike me with a thunderbolt. "Granted!!"  

I don't feel anything. "Urmmm... I don't feel anything."  

"You have what you wish. Goodbye"  

"Wait!!" I yelled as the genie descent into the lake.  

"You look like a pokemon. Are pokemon real?" I need to asked. I just need to asked.  

"I don't have permanent form. I appears as whatever the person wanted me to be." the genie wave me goodbye & disappear into the lake.  

I smile as I'm gonna have a blast in 2017. 

Or so I thought...  

_______________
Since that night, every time the clock strike 8:17pm I'm gonna have a time of my life. Literally a time of my life. For 60 seconds the time around me moves so slow to a state of almost stop. On the other hand, my motivation, my inspiration & my aspiration peaked to a level I can't fathom. Granted I can do things more easily but I can't do this anymore. That genie misunderstood my words for something else. I bet he understand my wish as 'having a year worth of productivity at 8:17pm'. That blasted genie have sentenced me to a year worth of 60 seconds time prison.  

It was fun at first. I even have time to wrote a few books in those time. But this is too much. It's been a month since then & I feel like some 300 years old dude in 30 years old body. I feel weak, anxious & exhausted.
