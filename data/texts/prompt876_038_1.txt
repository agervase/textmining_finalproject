I had died inside one of those filthy trenches of the War. The second one. It was a mostly painless experience before my soul was lifted into the bliss of Paradise... That is, bliss until I actually saw it. 

See, Paradise is very similar to what we imagine it to be. Golden streets, green, vast plains, white buildings of the most pristine marble. I did not even expected to be brought to this place after what the War made me do. But here I was, and what I saw shocked me more than said War. It took me a bit to grow used to the *twist* before me, which presented a scene much too similar to what I was used to seeing down there shortly before I was gone. 

Paradise was in total disrepair, corrupted by destruction. The pearly marble cracked, the golden streets stained with blood. A hundred winged beings on the ground, some with one or both wings ripped off, some with their feathers burned. All dead. It was the War all over again. Different theme, same narrative. 

As I walk up the golden road, I follow the trail of angelic corpses up to a welcoming light coming from inside what appears to be a temple. Inside the colossal, impossibly-ornated structure, more corpses. This time of beings many times bigger than me, dressed in what I can only understand as heavy, golden armor. I press on, past their corpses, and climb a stairway following where the blood trail leads me. I start to see creations that defy all human comprehension, like structures made of wheels inside wheels covered in a million eyes, all of them crying blood, or gigantic amalgamations of animals wielding swords as big as skyscrappers. Are- or better, where these things *alive* at some point?! And if they were... *What* left them on this state?

Approaching the top of the stairway, I see a golden throne with an infinitely resplandescent sky behind it. And I finally reach the source of the welcoming light I saw before. A glowing, humanoid body made of what appears to be liquid light, but whose shine is almost completelly gone, very slowly ebbing away. Its body is pierced by a fairly rustic blade, and above the figure, a pale man stands with a terrible expression and another blade in his hand dripping with the same liquid light escaping the insides of the luminous being.

*"W-what happened... Are you... Are you... Death?"* 

*"I have been called that before. But I'm not he, for he has also died by my hand."* 

*"You killed Death?! Did you do this? What ARE you? What kind of abomination could do such a thing?"* 

*"Abomination are the gods, who keep mortals under their heel to feed them with their devotion and prayer. But I have learned to not listen to any god, to not fall for their promises and illusions. They made me what I am, and I have proved there is no immortal god. I am the Ghost of Sparta!"*
