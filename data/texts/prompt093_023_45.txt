"Save her!"

"Wha-?"

"I summoned you here to save her! Do it!"

On the table lay a woman with labored breath and covered in blood.

"I can't do it here. You'll have to send me back. I need an ER."

"I have an ear for you right here, demon!" The man jiggles his own bloody ear in his hand.

"No, I need an E... R... An emergency room you imbecile. Send us both back and she'll be healed."

"No. No I won't do it. I won't let you make her a demon like you. They never come back the same."

"Of course they don't. You can't take a bite of the apple of knowledge and stay ignorant."

"SAVE HER, DEMON!"

The man standing in an arcane circle wearing a long white robe and a strange creature about his neck sighs. "You are all fools. Damned fools." Then he clapped his hands and was gone. So was the woman.

For the next month, the young sorcerer wept. He had sold his love to a demon. Then, a loud clap and the sound of something solid bouncing on the floor pulled him out of his remorse. When he approached the strange object, he saw her smiling face. Then the object spoke...

"Hey Joe. Thanks for helping me. It's better here. People are happy. Their babies live past infancy, infections don't kill people, and there's much less war and violence. I've decided to stay with Dr. Hapburn. He's the man you summoned to save me. He's been kind to me and he is wealthier than our king! Good luck, Joe. I don't think I'll ever see you again."

Then the object went dark. Joe let out an anguished scream. "DAMN YOU DEMON!"

"Welcome back, Dr. Hapburn!"

"Thanks Sally. We need to get this one to the ICU."

"We're on it doctor. Why doesn't Texas just join the Federation of Nations?"

"I don't know. King Norris won't let them. It's just good for us that the Global Processing Unit is available for teleportation requests."

"I hear the locals think people who talk to the GPU are sorcerers."

"Yes, that's true. Poor fools."
