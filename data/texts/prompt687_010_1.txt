With every step that I took I looked over my shoulder. What if the other me was suddenly behind me, ready to slit my throat... Paranoia started growing inside me. At one point I didn't even look forward anymore. I started walking backwards and turn with every step I took. Where to hide?! Did the other me also have my memories? If so, then I wouldn't be able to hide anywhere I've ever been before!

From the moment that I had existed I had a feeling that I was meant to do something. I had this blood-thirst that I didn't know how to stop. A blurry image in my mind. My only memories where from that day, when I woke up in the middle of the street. But somehow I knew where I was going. I was drawn to a place, if it even was a place, I had the feeling that the point that I was drawn to kept moving.

I had to stop to rest a bit. Exhaustion has taken over me. It's been 6 hours since I went through that malfunctioning teleportation booth. As I turn the corner I find a small cafe. I decide that whatever is going to happen, I'll probably die of exhaustion and thirst if I don't take a break from running right now. The cafe is almost empty, beside for the the woman who seems to be waiting for her a meeting. I walk to the bar and ask for a glass of sparkling water. Even when I'm on the verge of dying I'll still think about my diet. I decide to sit in the far left corner so I can overview the entire cafe. When I get my water I start staring at the bubbles in it. I get lost in my thoughts and forget to pay attention to my surroundings.

~

That blurry image stays in the back of my mind with every step that I take. When I pass a shop with mirroring windows I look at myself for the first time. "Hmm I don't look that bad." I think to myself. Then the blurry image is back on my mind again. It starts to get less blurry. "She looks kind of cute. We look a lot alike." I mumble. I kept wondering who she is and why she is the only one I seem to remember. Suddenly I hear my tummy rumbling. I decide that I should get something to eat. I turn the corner and walk into a small cafe that seems to draw my attention.

~

The bell on the door rings. I nearly jump up as I'm drawn back into reality. I have no idea for how long I zoned out, but at least I'm still alive. The man is still standing in the doorway, his eyes locked on mine. He walks to a table and sits down. "Who is he and why does he seem so familiar." I start to wonder. Every time I look towards him he seems to glare at me too. I look away in embarrassment. 

~

The second I walk into the cafe my eyes are drawn to the back of the cafe. There she is, the woman who's been in my mind for as long as I can remember. She's noticed me too. Tho she seemed kind of startled when I walked in, but maybe they're just not used to more than 2 costumers. I sit down at a table where I can still look at her. Watching her from over the menu, I can see that she's still staring at me. I need to know who she is. I get up again and start walking toward her table. She's starting to blush. "Can I sit with you?" I ask her with a shaky voice that I don't recognize. As she nods a few of her curls escape from her bun. I have to fight the urge to put her hair behind her ear. "Shit, she wants to know my name. What is my name?!" I had to improvise. "Alex, what about you?"

~

"Bella", I replied in a soft voice. I felt drawn to the man in front of me. I felt a comfort that I've never felt before. The paranoia fading away. We talked a bit about where we're from, tho I noticed that he didn't share that much about him. We'd been talking for hours. I didn't even realize that it was already starting to get dark. The waiter walked to our table and said that they were closing up. Alex looked at the bill. I saw a shock in his eyes. "Don't worry, it's on me." I said. The second that I reached for my wallet the door flew open. The bell ringing loud.

~

"Number 06500, you have failed your mission!" A man in a black suit said. The other two men pointed guns at us. "What is going on?!" I screamed towards Bella. "Who are you and what have you done?!" She said nothing and stared at me with an open mouth. "Don't blame the girl for your mistakes, number 06500. This is all on you. You should've killed her." The second man said. "I didn't do anything!" I said to Bella. "You have to trust me!" 

~

I didn't know what to do. I felt that my face was wet. Apparently I had started crying. Alex placed his hand on my arm and smiled sad. We both knew that we wouldn't get out of this place alive. The men started walking towards us. Alex and I stared each other in the eyes as the men stood behind us and pointed their guns at our head. "This has been the greatest malfunction that we've ever seen. Never has there been a male copy of a woman passing through the  teleportation booth, can't we just both let them live?" The youngest of the three asked to the other men. Apparently that kind of compassion wasn't tolerated and the tallest man shot him in the head. The man fell to the ground and a puddle of blood formed around him. Then both men turned to us again and pointed their guns to our heads again. "Well, you've managed to stay alive for quite a while, miss Atwood. Unfortunately you've overstayed your welcome in this world." The leader said. 
There was a loud bang and I saw blood dripping down Alex. Another loud bang. And then there was nothing.
