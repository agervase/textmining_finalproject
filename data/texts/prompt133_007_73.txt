I don't fear death. Not because it will never come, and it won't, for me. I can't really say if I would prefer it. Life can be oh so... tedious, but once in a while it can surprise me. I mean, Stranger Things is pretty good, so 2016 wasn't a total wash. And Patrick Stewart will be reprising his role as Captain Jean Luc Picard, so that's something to look forward to.

I've been around this rock more times than I care to remember. I've fathered countless children to countless long dead wives and girlfriends. Hell, if I'm really thinking about it, by now I'm probably the ancestor of most of these humans still wandering around to their graves. So quickly, it seems like an instant, to me, now. 

Humans... yes, I was human. Am human? I'm not quite sure what to consider myself, other than not whatever it is they are. 

Yet as fragile as they are, they seem intent on making it worse. Inventing newer and better ways to die. New guns, new bombs, new drugs. No skin off my back, really.

No, the only thing that really scares me now is global warming. Because I'm a social justice warrior? Nope, definitely not that. Only skin I've really got in this game is that there is a game to begin with. This rock has endless entertainment but it does get pretty dull these days. After so, so many years just wandering around, it just all feels so... small. 

If I'm going to be around for a while, I'd like to visit the stars before they burn out. Can't do it alone, sadly, and if these God damn apes can't get off this planet before they blow it all to shit, well, I'm the one left holding the bag. Trust me, I've learned more than a million people could ever hope to forget, and this one is for real. We're talking end of days, race against time real. 

So for the first time in a really long time, I'm going to help them. Don't really have a choice, not if I'm getting off this rock while the getting's good.
