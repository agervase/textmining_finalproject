And then we heard nothing but screaming. In the background, sounds of crashing metal, flesh being torn, and blood splattering the floor clouded the transmission. One man seemed lucky enough to reach the microphone and cry for help before beginning to choke on what seemed to be a thick liquid. Then, the transmission screen paused and turned off with a quiet zap. Around me, the room was dead silent.

"I... Commander, what shall we... ?" the Lieutenant's voice trailed off. 

I was completely speechless. Whatever just happened was something I had never expected to witness my entire life. In the past century of research, none of Baer's satellites had ever shown any signs of life on the planet. And now there were other inhabitants on Mars? Impossible. Our technology at Baer is executed with 99.9% accuracy, detecting anything and everything made out of organic compounds. If there were another civilization there, we would've detected it. This couldn't be happening right now...

"Everybody calm down." 

Commander had clearly seen that the room was about to jump into panicked distress. 

"We have not yet confirmed that this message was sent directly from Ares. This could be a prankster pulling tricks on us for all we know." 

However, it was clear that there was panic in his eyes as well. I think he knew that message was sent directly from Ares itself -- in fact, from working with the transmission department during my previous five-year tenure, I knew, too, that the message signature verified that there was no way this could have been sent to us by anyone else.

"So what should we do, Commander?" I asked.  "I think we all know the origin of the message."

Commander opened his mouth, seemingly about to repeat his previous message, but then hesitated and rubbed his chin.

"Notify Squadron A immediately that I expect to see them in the Hussey Room in exactly twenty-five minutes. Go!"
