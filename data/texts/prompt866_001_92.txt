It had seemed normal when we were children. Max and I would run around in the backyard of his McMansion, calling each other by fantastic names-- him Grinn, me Lok. We even had small little badges that Max's dad had made for us with our names laser engraved onto them. It was fun while it lasted, but kids tended to grow up, and with that, they grew out of childish play, like imaginary friends and swinging branches through the air while envisioning ourselves as knights in magic armor driving off swarms of airy ogres. But I invested myself into it, at least as much as Max did.

So one day, during the summer after fifth grade, while laying down across his sofa, I told him-- I told him that we should probably stop with our imaginary fights. We would be heading off to middle school soon, and the older kids would be on the hunt for fresh dweebs to torment. Max turned to look at me with a perplexed look on his face. His brows were scrunched up, and I could see that he was struggling to string together a response.

"Y-you. You don't remember either, do you?"

Of course, at the time, I had no idea what he was talking about, but looking back, he may have thought that I was trying to blend in and hide. I can recall having seen a patchwork of dark splotches on Max's skin in the early days of our childhood, so perhaps he had thought that I had gone through a similar ordeal. At that time, however, my reply to Max was that of silence, and after a few strikes of the second hand on the grandfather clock down the hall, Max simply got up and left. We remained good friends afterward, but our relationship never seemed to be the same. He was a little more secretive around me and more thought was put into his words whenever we talked. We drifted away. 

I made new friends in middle school, joined the choir team, and had my first girlfriend. For the first time in my life, I was popular. I had a way with people, a magnetic warmth that attracted the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. My teachers loved me for my high grades and willingness to help other students. I didn't see Max too often during middle school, but whenever I did, he was still at it, fighting imaginary beasts and going through a ridiculous workout routine "optimized to prepare you for the final boss." My biggest concern for the two of when we were graduating from elementary never came to pass for me, but strangely enough, it was the same with Max. I never saw him get bullied, and the teachers always seemed to dote on him more than the other students in his classes. 

I lived the high life in middle school, and things only got better in high school. Academics in high school were even easier than in middle school, I was a track star and the best quarterback my district had seen in years. By the time graduation came along, I was scouted by a Division I college football team and was going to attend university on a four-year scholarship with the opportunity to join the NFL after college. My parents suggested that I spend one last day at Max's place before I left for college, so I obliged. I don't know if it was a mistake or not, after all, ignorance is bliss.

We got into a fight that day. I saw him dressing up in what looked to be leather armor, daggers strapped to his thighs and a homemade bow on his back. So I confronted him in the capacity of a friend, telling him that he needed to grow up and continue on with his life. He could still go to a junior college and transfer to a four-year university. Max refused, told me that I was a pompous dickhead who "would rather abandon his best friend to stick his dick in a fourteen-year-old bitch than stay true to his friend." Thinking now, throwing the first punch was probably not the wisest idea, but next thing I know, I'm waking up on a dirty hospital bed surrounded by people dressed in rags, their eyes having long lost any joy. 

"You've been in a coma for six years. We wanted to wake you, but there was a protective ward and a stasis spell around you. He said that when the time was right, you would wake up, and you would help us."

I was perplexed, a deafening silence filled the room.

"He? Who is he? What's going on?"

"It was Grinn. He told us that if he never came back, we should wait for you to wake up. Said that you were the only one trained for this." 

A woman walked up to me and placed two small badges into my hand. As soon as I touched them, the world seemed to pause. A robotic voice rang in my ear:

**Stats-Module Loading**

I looked at the two badges in my hand. This was the truth. I wasn't completely sure of what was going on, but I knew that Max hadn't been lying. I don't know why he had put me under stasis, but he had passed the torch onto me, regardless of whether I wanted it or not. Hell, I wasn't even sure of what carrying this torch would entail, but maybe I owed it to Max to do something about it. I looked at the badges once again before declaring my name.
