**Part one**

There’s fire licking over the hilltop.  If I blink, it fades for a few seconds, but it takes less time than that to start intruding again from every side - reddish orange tendrils that come creeping in a circle from the edge of my vision and winding towards a common centre.

If I stare straight ahead and keep moving, it’s like walking through a flaming circus hoop.  Which isn’t too bad of an analogy, actually, since all my extremities have started burning.  Ever had sunburn on your scalp?  That sort of cold, persistent tingle?  Imagine that, but it’s dancing in little tippy taps up your toes, unfurling along your fingers, and forcing its way down your forehead to your face.

The watch says I still have three hours until I start really losing coordination.  Probably happen about 6AM.  For now, though, I can walk straight enough and keep my little torch trained on the trail.

Cut from packed dirt decades ago, the path leads gently uphill, slaloming left and right between big, multi-arm cactuses and gatherings of shrubby grass that whoever was digging back then couldn’t be bothered to uproot and dispose of.  

On the peak I can just pick out the Airstream, a glowing silver smudge against the stars.  That’s a bad thing; I left the camp dark and the doors barred.  There’s no way I forgot to put out the fire, so where is the glow coming from?  Collect a bucket of water from underneath the stretched tarp of the overnight collector, then dump it over the firepit, sit down close, and make up a story about the embers.  That’s been mine and Clara’s nighttime ritual for the last few weeks.  Tonight it was fairies lighting signals in the clefts of the earth, calling kids to safety.  After she fell asleep, I carried her inside the caravan and put her on the bed, bundled in the /Super Monsters/ bedsheet we rescued from her room at my mother-in-law’s place on the way out of the city.

That show, about daycare for the children of famous supernatural villains, had a catchprase, “sun down, monsters up,” that I stopped finding cute a few months ago.  For obvious reasons.

When I was sure Clara was asleep, I crept out like I do every night, and barred the door with bike lock and a length of lightning rod I stole from the basement of the radio station.  Like I do every night.  On the way out of camp, I dumped another bucketload of water on the firepit, just to be sure.  Sorry, fairies.  Point being, I shouldn’t be able to see even a single frond of smoke, but right now there’s definitely a light playing against the metal of the caravan on one side.

I try blinking to shoo it away.  I try blinking twice.  The light doesn’t go away, but it does move.  Which means someone else is up there.

I break into a run, but have to stop after just a couple of shuffling paces.  I drop the torch when my hands fly instinctively to my left knee, which has locked solid.  I squeeze the watch face and use the light from it to check the bite over.  It looks bad, but that’s to be expected given one of them tried to gnaw my kneecap off.   I should still be able to move it for another few hours, though, so I pick the torch up and clamp the barrel between my teeth.  If Clara had woken up I’d be able to hear her screaming from here, even inside the caravan, so I count my blessings.  That happened once and I came back at first light to find her under the fold-out ironing board, inconsolable.  Judging from the swollen face and dry heaves, she must have been crying for hours.  It took her days to forgive me, and even longer for her to feel comfortable leaving my side even to play on the other side of our tiny camp, near the car.   I didn’t forgive myself, but there was a reason for what I was doing.  At least I thought there was.

Back in the now, my scream is muffled by the mouthful of metal, and a couple of swift, sharp, self-inflicted punches above and below the knee get me up and moving again.

I cover the middle distance pretty quickly by keeping to a low jog, bent at the waist to try and minimise my silhouette from whoever might be watching up there.  My hammer hangs from my belt.  When I reach the line where the scrub grass begins to thin and cover gets sparse,I have to slow down and crouch even further, because now I know there are definitely people here.  Two of them.  A man and a woman.  He’s circling the camp slowly, looking outwards with a hand on his hip; she’s fiddling with what looks like a metal box on the fold-out table we’ve been using to prepare and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  So I guess they’re armed.  And with ammo to spare.  

This is bad.  This is, frankly, fucked.  I need to pick the right moment to make a break for them, I need to - 

**MOVE EAT MOVE**

For a second I think my eyes are shut and I’m on my back and the sun is shining through the lids to make all this red, but a few blinks and they start to clear from the centre outwards.  The left side of my face is in the dirt, but I don’t remember falling down.  Shit.  I must have just passed out.  I draw a deep breath in, then immediately regret it as I suck up a handful of dust and buckle in two, trying not to bark out loud as I spit it back up as quietly as I can onto my cargo shorts.  Coming to a sitting position, I see the sky hasn’t changed, and the man is still circling the camp.  I can’t see the woman any more, but I can’t have been out too long.  

Fuck.  I’m lucky I didn’t land in the dry grass, otherwise the rustling would have given me away instantly.  Stupid stupid stupid.  But hey, stupid seems pretty par for the course for me tonight.  To whit: I’m about to die over some shampoo.

Earlier, once I’d doused the fire again, let the hissing die down, and listened for any sounds from the valley below, I set out along the ridge for the radio station.  That’s probably too grandiose a word for it, “station,” but, made up of a fairly new-looking metal mast and a group of small pre-fab buildings sat on concrete risers, “tower” sells it a little short.  Inside, the biggest of the buildings houses all the transmission equipment in a soundproof booth, a tiny reception desk with a telephone, and a library of typical nighttime filler music for packing dead air.  The medium-sized building is a spartan canteen with a makeshift bedroom behind a partition curtain.  The smallest is a chemical toilet.

I’ve been hiking the twenty minutes over there every night since we left the city limits and set up in the desert - just far enough away to see the lights on the horizon, but not close enough that the sound from the generators would draw any corpses up from the streets.  I watched the station for several nights when we first arrived, before we spread out the camp and I built the fire pit and moisture collector.  We were still drinking shop-bought water back then, and when Clara was asleep I’d take a blanket and a bottle, sit about sixty feet outside the range of the motion-activated floodlights, and keep watch for the entire night to make sure nobody was actually living there.  The mast has blinking red lights near the top, where it narrows, and I remember finding that slow pulse quite soothing.  A steady rhythm with nothing but the stars behind it.
