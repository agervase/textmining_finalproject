On the cold dark night of 1343, a desperate messenger rushed to the capital. Drenched wet by rain and blood, the royal carpet was less then prepared for him.
“Your highness!” The courier shouted.
“Where are you from and what happened?!” The king asked.
The courier looked scared, traumatized. As if the worst has Happened.
“They’re dead!” The courier tried to say. “They’re all dead!”
“Who?” The king asked, now curious.
“They...” The courier mumbled. “They came from the sea. They talked a language un-heard of and-“
The king stood up. “From the sea?!”
“They have massive ships, to fancy for anything from Europe.” The courier explained
“Impossible!” The king declared. “The world ends just beyond Iberia, there’s no way they came further then-“
The courier stood up. “TELL THAT TO THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN HANGED ON POLES!”
The king scuffed. “Do you know where they’re heading?”
“No, but they might gravitate to a nearby city. You’ve got to hurry!” The courier responded.
The king turned around. “Then we’ll leave by dawn, we cannot let whatever those savages are ravage us.”


After about a day of long travels, the main army has arrived at a village close to a port. And yet, they were to late. The village was filled with strange wooden poles carved with faces that might as well be of demons, and obsidian poles hanging dead corpses. Then they noticed a group of strangely dressed men.
“In the name of the lord what have you done to these people?!” The king demanded to know.
The oddly dressed men talked in an unknown language, whatever they said was no different then gibberish. They then raised their spears and attacked.
“So be it” The king realized as the two armies attacked...

What happened to the king no one knows. What is known is that the village was only the first in the line of many more victims of the sunset invasion.
