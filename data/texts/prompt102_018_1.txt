Had he not walked out of a doorway made of pure light that spontaneously appeared in the middle of my room, I might not have believed he was really Lucifer.  
  
In fact, my initial thought was that he was a magical high powered lawyer. Think hybrid “Doctor Strange” and “Patrick Bateman” and you’ll be on the right track.  
  
He was about 6 feet tall, well built with an immaculate, impeccably tailored suit that very likely cost more than my car. And good looking. I’m a straight guy, but this dude looked like he was chiseled straight out of marble. He had perfectly kept blond hair (of course it’s blonde) that curled upwards to two small points like horns, jawline so strong it would make “Ah-nuld” blush, and a face so clean cut I’m not sure if it even grew hair. He was even carrying a martini, at noon! Like James Goddammed Bond.  
  
Then I saw his eyes. There was a fire in them that no human could ever possess. This thing that was in front of me was consumed by a desire so intense that would burn a mortal like you or me alive.  
  
*“We need to talk.”* He started and even his voice was like honey.  
  
I just stood there with my mouth open.  
  
*“Close that.”* I did.  
  
*“Like I was saying, we need to talk; by now you have some sort of idea who I am, so there’s no need for introductions.”* This time I manage to shake my head.  
  
*“These ‘Writing Prompts’ involving me are going to stop. Immediately. There was some humor in them initially, but now they’re starting to threaten the branding.”  *
  
“The what?” Oh good, I’ve remembered words now.  
  
*”The ‘Branding.’ They’re starting to ruin my name. You and your little cohorts are either making me out to look like an inept fool or completely powerless; and I can assure you neither of those is the case.”*  
  
I don’t even begin to doubt of that.  
  
*”Now normally I’d flash fry you in the heat of a dying star, but that would mean doing it every time someone on earth gets it in their head to make a new prompt; not to mention I actually do enjoy some of your stories from time to time and I don’t like wasting talent. Not to mention my time is far too valuable for that.  
So instead you’re going to be my messenger. If I see one more of these prompts about ‘If Satan…’ or ‘…but it was actually Satan’ on my feed, everything you know and love will be turned to ash in front of your eyes and I’ll save those for last. Am I clear?”*  
  
“Yes, s-s-sir.” I manage.  
  
*”Excellent!”* He finishes joyfully; like we’re old friends instead of having just threatened everything I know and love.
*”Then enjoy the drink and if you ever find yourself in LA, come look us up.”*  
  
With that he left the Martini and a business card on my desk and walked back through his magic doorway.  
  
So **PLEASE** stop. For my children’s sakes.

In case it wasn't blindingly obvious I was trying to take a page from Mike Carey here. If you haven't read his Lucifer run, do it now. That series had some of the best banter and characters that I've seen. Ever.  
Bonus, it's what the Fox show wishes it could be instead of devolving into a stupid ship show that it's becoming.
