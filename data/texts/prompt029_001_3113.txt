"Hi, uh... so, I think I might have been the victim of a prank, but..."

...

"I see. So, this really is Hell's telephone number, is that it?"

...

"Well, whether I believe it or not, there's... uh... look, my daughter asked for a pony, see?"

...

"That's not really relevant, is it? I mean, yes, obviously she likes it, but..."

...

"Of course it's a problem! Where am I supposed to keep a twelve-hundred-pound horse?!"

...

"No, I didn't weigh it! It was an estimate!"

...

"Is there someone else there I can talk to?"

...

"Hi, so, listen, I was just telling the other..."

...

"As in, like, *Satan?* Hell's head honcho?"

...

"For starters, I always pictured hi... you... as a male."

...

"No, I've never been particularly religious, but the presence of a sulfur-spewing equine on my front lawn is making me rethink a few things. That is, as I've been trying to say, the reason for my call! Now, can you *please* explain why my front garden has been reduced to charcoal?!"

...

"She's four years old! She obviously meant 'Santa!' She just can't spell very well! Furthermore, I don't recall the words 'fire,' 'flaming,' or 'total destruction of meticulously maintained property' appearing anywhere in her letter!"

...

"At the moment? She's riding around on its back."

...

"'Fluffy Sunshine,' I think. Look, why does any of this matter?! I can't keep a horse – one spawned from Hell or otherwise – on my property!" 

...

"What? Oh, yes. No, I didn't open it. I was a bit preoccupied."

...

"Why? Is there going to be a tiny, fire-breathing quail in it or something?"

...

"Fine. Hang on."

...

"It's a wallet."

...

"No, no, I get it: It's because dads *always* get wallets, right? It's always wallets or ties."

...

"Sure, thanks, happy Christmas to you, too. Now, can we please di... hello? *Hello?!*"

...

"God damn it."
