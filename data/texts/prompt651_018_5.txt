King Vernon rushed to the courtyard, heedless of his advisors who were likely shouting about his weak heart.  His daughter was safe again, what else mattered?

His breath hitched as he saw her.  His beloved Maltilde's dress was torn to shreds and covered in soot.  Her dark braids had become matted during her months of absence.  But she was alive.  He hugged her tightly for a long minute before releasing her.

"Father, it is good to see you again," she said.  "About that reward you promised..."

King Vernon finally spared a glance towards her rescuer.  He was a slight boy, seemingly barely eight or nine at most.  "He does seem a bit young, but to have saved you from the dragon he surely deserves your hand in marriage and my kingdom once he comes of age."

Maltilde shook her head.  "Sh... He only brought me the final miles home.  Please reward him generously for his service and assign your finest guards to escort him back to his family.  Bear in mind that they might have lost twenty sheep while he wasn't guarding them from wolves, and lacking their only horse and wagon was also a great inconvenience."

King Vernon nodded and motioned for one of his advisors.  "See to that, Kervan.  Maltilde, tell me, how did you escape."

"That's the trouble father."  Her lip quivered as she tried and failed to put on a brave facade.  "I was rescued, but by a dragon more ferocious than the one who took me.  He wants me to return to him, and sovereignty over your lands.  Terrible things will happen if you don't give that to him."

"No.  I've made a terrible mistake."  King Vernon stumbled and clutched his chest before collapsing.  The world grew faint as his advisors crowded around him.  He heard his daughter crying, but he was consumed with a warm haze.

(I feel that this is terrible.  Please concrit harshly.)
