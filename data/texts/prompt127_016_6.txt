Every day. Every day, I get out of bed, shower, brush my teeth, try to eat a good breakfast. I turn on the news and sigh hearing report after report after report of death, rape, tragedy, homicide. I can't do much but I can do something.

I help the blind. I help the sick. I help the needy. Every day. I can't do much but I can do something. Today, I volunteered at the homeless shelter. There is a cold front coming through tonight and the temperature is going to be record freezing. I can't do much, but at least I can knit. I can help them escape the bite of the cold just a little. Every little bit helps.

At first, I didn't realize what had happened. I didn't even feel the sting of my needle piercing the tip of my finger. She did. Her eyes were wide at first and when she looked upon my face full of blind horror, I felt the dull ache in my finger. I glanced down in an instant and saw what she saw. Every little bit. My blood looked like molten tar. Thick, congealed, diseased.

By the time I looked back at her, the horror had fled, replaced by what I can only call sad recognition. She handed me a napkin and shrugged, shaking her head before she walked off.

Every day. Every day it happens eventually. Someone remembers. Someone puts a face to a name and knows who I am. They remember the street. The fire. The dead. Every day, I remember the dead. Every day, I wake up, I shower, and I beg to whoever, whatever is out there for forgiveness. I don't just ask, I work, I try to make it right. For every soul I've taken, I pray that I can save another.

For those 27 dead, those poor burned people. Every day, I think of you and try. Every day, I hope that the sins that have turned my blood black are evened out somehow. I don't know if they ever will. I won't stop until I can't stop. Every little bit helps.

I can't do much to change what I did. I can't do much but I can do something.
