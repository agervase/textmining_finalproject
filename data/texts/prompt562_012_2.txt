After a thousand years, with who knows how many people thinking I was an evil spirit and trying to kill me, I decided to kill everyone. The year was 2280. Earth was messed up. Not a beautiful planet like I remember, but a dying planet. There used to 7 billion people here 200 years ago. Now, there were only 100 million people. They all lived in small villages. It kind of reminded me of when I was a kid. 

The first village was only a days walk away from my cave. I didn’t know how I would kill them. With a knife possibly? Or maybe poisoned food? I spent the entire day thinking. As I got to the village, I gasped. It looked like my old village, where I fell in love with a girl, Fay. Fay knew about me being cursed by a witch. We were going to run away from the village when her parents found out. She was sent to live with her sister in the next village nearby. I never got over her. There wasn’t a day I didn’t think about her.

I wiped my tears away. There was no time thinking about Fay. She was dead. Time to kill this village. I took out my knife. I went into the first house. Inside I saw a girl with beautiful golden hair. That reminded me of Fay. The girl turned around. I gasped when I saw her face. It was Fay!

“Cedric!” She exclaimed. She explained the whole story. The witch came to see her about a month after she left. She cursed her too. She knew that she should get over me, but she knew that someday she would see me again.
