A perfect autumn day in the windy city, as it were. The wind kicks up and moves a cloud, revealing the light from the heavens. The chimes of the church Bella near the daily center strike a nerve that sends a chill down my spine, I look up and see my wife who's selling fruit at a farmers market at the Daily center. 
I remember thinking .. 
"This is heaven" 
It was a cute sentiment. I left the market in search of an apron. My search lead me to local hardware store where no one was working, and there were no customers but by all appearances, is open for business. I look at the checkout line and notice that the register is open and see some bills peeking out. Instantly I think of the matrix. I realise that I'm being tested, I didn't know I was being led straight into hell. 
I hear a door open and look towards it and was frightened because the man that appeared in the doorway was me, only more tan. I greet myself with that curious nod and I am silent. I motion with my hand for me to follow me through the doorway. The hallway was the corridor leading put to the center of the colosseum of the old world. I point myself toward the desk at the center of the battleground and as I take my seat the crowd, which had been previously unnoticed erupts into cheers, jeers and other manner of taunting. Confused and scared I see a button on the desk, and press it, per my fort√©. The screen is a photo of the earth from space then fades to lettering like you see in those memoirs.

 The movie begins and the crowd reflects my every emotion. Mostly horror. The film is all black and white at the beginning, slowly fading to color. 
The scene is my wife, sobbing at my funeral. She had found my body in the living room. I suffered a massive heart attack at an early age. Stress was the biggest killer they said. The film plays my life in reverse and ends with the same photo of the earth, exactly as it were before and after my life. Unchanged.
