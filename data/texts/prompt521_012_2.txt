*I should be sleeping now. Come on you were falling asleep on the laptop but you can't sleep when you want to?*

*What was it again? 60 secconds of blinking? 1 mississippi.*

*2 Mississippi.*

*3 mississippi.*

*\*zzzzzum\**

*4 miss--oh please not now! Please I want to sleep! Get your predatory blood-sucking face the hell out!*

*Well, technically incorrect since mosquitoes only serve as transit vectors for some of the most dangerous disseases for us at least until we.. no. I could start working on just purging the things like Emma told me would like when we went to see the purge and she didn't pay for her own half of popcorn until I saw her aga-- God damm it...*

I rolled over and bunched up the thin sheet covering me, brought it to my face then flopped down on my pillow and screamed my frustrations away.

I wanted sleep. I was awake thinking precious time away about petty. *Hell*. Completely irrelevant things while I waited for the fuzzy oblivion of sleep that came when I least expected it. Usually right at the end of that exact thought I mused. Well no more!  I very obviously blew my chance with that fit.

I looked up from the crumpled up sheets and sighed completely resigned to this misserable night. A tear rolled down my cheek  as my ringing ears asserted themselves again.

I could end this. Both dreaded white pills awaiting in the folds of my backpack. I could jump out of bed, yank them out and swallow them whole before I could stop myself...  3.2.1.Go!

...

Phew. That was something. Somewhat. Good thing I didn't even move too, that's good. You put these rules youself and locked both poison pills away years ago. They can rot for all I care now that i've found my calling in life. But, i'm still afraid. Afraid of the world and what it will do to me even at my strongest and wisest. No one or no thing has got the blame of that but me. Do I keep climbing the mointain with these stones on my back? Or do I let them fall and fade out before they even touch the ground? What's on the other side? Why can't I ever choose?

\------------------------------------

"Morning!" I hear my little sister call. "Where did you leave my markers yesterday?" *markers..mark-markers.markers*

"In my green bag." I groaned. "Back pouch"

"got 'em! okay bye" and she's gone. My neck's sore, probably the position. My chest also hurts, that's a new one. Then it starts warming up. Time to get up. *walk. walk. turn. walk walk. turn. close. get naked. cold water.* Oh thats nice.

\------------------------------------

On my way to my microbiology class I noticed a lot more people on the street than usual. On the street meaning homeless. Were they always there? Sure looks like it. I could just- whoah stop that. This money is counted and already rationed so just fo-oh darn. "Ummm. Yeah you're welcome."    *can i still take it?   well. you could but it's already in his hand.  but what about food? he's hungrier than you will for in the day, keep walking. hmmmmm*

"There."  *OH for-!* *now you're just not going to eat.   I can help with that.   Yeah yeah, water and charity yadi-yadi-ya.*

\----------------------------------

**School was a breeze. Not starving to death because of your concentration is just dope.**

You sure about that? I could not do that and you know me!

**heck yea. I even gave money to homeless.**

so waht you want me to aplaud you for that?

\*what

**no. it's just. i don't know why i even mentioned it**

**anyway. them noms are right here and ill c you later.**

baiii

"Thanks ma" I smiled. Putting the offending portable computer away.

"you're very welcome" She smiled. And turned away.

Mid bite I heard plastic bags rustling. Nothing strange really. Until I was already at the door with the trash bags in hand with a peeved sister holding it open and looking at me. "Hurry up so I can lock you out" she said. Not giving her an answer I walked past her. And then sprinted after the garbage truck shouting at it with a madly cackling sibling in the background.

\-------------------

Leaving my homework for tomorrow was a terrible habit. But I was drained, as was my cellphone battery so no soothing music this night. Then just at the edge of sleep I felt a pull on my mind. I gave in for God knows why.

*Don't speak the name of the Lord in vain. S*poke some soft being in a dreamy landscape. And Wow she's preety.

Ps. How's my english? :v
