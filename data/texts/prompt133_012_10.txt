“Ah yes, thank you Tim.” I took the porcelain cup from Tim’s hand. His head jerked up, as though snapping into attention.

“R-right,” he said. Strange. Tim never had an accent like that. He left my room in a hurry. The grinding cogs in the door spun up again, ending in a clank. I glanced up at the tinted glass window as I sipped from the cup. Hmm, the tea was good.

They’ve been having more and more conversations in the little mezzanine. Sometimes they’d look me in the eye, then look away. The one with the fancy hat waved his hand back and forth in slow sweeps, then jumped back when I followed his movements. I wonder what changed. The next day they replaced the window with something thicker. Something tells me they wanted privacy. I pretended to not see them anymore.

They brought someone new. Another shrink? He sat on the other end of the only table in my room. Smooth, unworked hands, shuffled loose papers into submission. He adjusted his spectacles.

“How are you?” He said. A formality.

“I’m doing okay. Wondering when you’ll let me out. It’s been a while since.”

“That’s… not a good idea right now,” he said.

“Why not?” 

“Listen. Let’s focus on what the previous doctor wrote down here.” He filtered through his papers.

“Ah. Dr. Morrows. Kind girl. Where is she right now? How is she doing?”

He paused, then sighed.

“She lived a long and happy life with her family, Mr. Semper.”

“Ah, that’s good. Good. Good.” There was something on my chin. I scratched it and tried to think. 

“…Please focus. Please,” the new doctor was saying.

“Hmm?”

“Do you want some coffee? Are you tired?” He asked.

“No I’m fully awake.”

He wrote something down. He caught me taking glances at his notepad and tilted it up ever so slightly.

“What do you mean ‘periods of unresponsiveness’?”

“W-what?” He asked. He seemed more surprised than me. I didn’t understand.

“I’m not ignoring you.”

“Sir you’ve been-- Let’s resume another day.” He gathered up his things.

“Sure.”

I heard them in the mezzanine talking. Apparently I was silent for three hours? I was just trying to remember Miss. Morrows. Couldn’t have been more than a moment. Hadn’t known she got married. I wondered why I wasn’t invited to the wedding. Hmm…

“Good morning,” the doctor said.

I frowned.

“Back already?”

He froze for a moment, then ignored me. Who was being rude now?

“I just want to verify what Morrows wrote,” he began. “What’s the earliest memory you have?”

“I think they were testing me.”

“Who’s they?” He asked.

“Uniforms. I don’t know. They come and go. I was on some kind of shuttle. It got really cold. Then really hot. I woke up in a big hole. Ha ha. I was naked.”

“The notes say you killed them. When they came to retrieve you. Were you angry that they did that to you?”

“Did what? Hmm. I remember a bunch of… a bunch of soldiers. They were all on fire. Bones smashed. Real pungent. I think I didn’t smell right for weeks.”

“Did you do that?” He asked.

“I’m just a regular guy.” I shrugged. But wait. I remembered. “It’s a condition. Some guy in a hood gave it to me a while ago. I don’t take certain things very well. I repulse them. Anyone in the area just happens to take it. Oh like this!”

I took the doctor’s pen out of his hand and slammed the tip into my forearm. 

“Christ!” He screamed. The chair rattled back. Scarlet gushed from his forearm. He turned towards the window. “Get me out!”

The door opened. The doctor rushed out the door. I kind of felt bad. But it wasn’t that big of a deal was it? I sat back down. 

“Mr. Semper?” It was another new doctor. “Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?”

“Go right ahead. But I feel like I’ve already told you people everything.”

She smiled. “We just want to make sure everything’s up to date. This-- your project hasn’t been accessed in over ten years after all.”

Maybe she made a mistake. I just played that practical joke a few moments ago with the previous guy. Hmm. Very strange.
