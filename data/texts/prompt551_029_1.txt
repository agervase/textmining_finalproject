You continue traveling down the narrow road, The skys filled with clouds. It was a particularly strange day for a man to die. For all you care Car crashes were stupid and easy to avoid, But not all of us are super bright. Mistakes happen. You glance behind you, There is a smoldering wreck that was once a car. Your car in fact, You bought it from a shady place that would better remain unnamed. That may explain why your wheels just steered to the right instead of just making a turn. You also see a misty robed figure with what you think are wings on it's back, It looks like it's scavenging for something and no one seems to be taking note of it. Maybe another ghost. Now you weren't much of a believer in the supernatural but whatever that is, It is definitely not normal. You continue walking with no particular destination in mind, You just really feel like walking for some reason. You turn your head to check if the strange figure is still by the wreck. Nope, He's gone. Well I guess it doesn't matter, What harm could he do. Andddddd.... He's right in front of you. Well whoever this edgelord was he sure seemed to like skeletons. You tell him to move... No response. You ask him several more times but in return still got no response from the man. You punch him in the face, Not that you meant to. Sometimes you just kind of snap. The man falls much more violently then you expected, You hear bones cracking and snapping. Oops. The edgelord is sprawled out on the road not making the slightest movement. You decide to investigate: You found a scythe, Upon further inspection it appears to have an engraving on it. "Grim Reaper, Protector of souls.". Well, Apparently you just killed the grim Reaper. Suddenly the clouds open up to reveal a eye. Not a nice looking eye, A mean one. You looked at the scythe and think "mine now". And ran away never to be seen again.         The end
