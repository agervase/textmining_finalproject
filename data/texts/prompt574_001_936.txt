I recognized them, these were my men. Johnson, McMeyer, Nguyn,  Hanson, Reyes, and Kuiper. Why was my squad here, and in full gear? I thought about the nightstand in the bedroom with my pistol, but we were in the living room. 

"Hanson, what's going on!?" I asked in an urgent whisper. 

"Sir, there was a credible threat. You're in danger here." Hanson replied. He was the serious sort, and was due to be promoted to squad leader after I left. I guess the movies were right about the  terrible things that happen to cops a week before retirement. His voice was trembling. What could have unnerved him?

"My wife, where is she?"

"Already handled sir," replied McMeyer. "She's been filled in and is in safe custody. Keep your head down sir."

I crouched behind the armored men, tucking my head down. If I wasn't in my pajamas I wouldn't feel so vulnerable, but I trusted these six men with my life every day for the last eight years, I wasn't about to question them now.

"Tell me what's happening!"

"Possible gas attack sir. Take a deep breath" said Nguyn.

A gas attack? My heart skipped a beat, I didn't have a gasmask. What were we going to do when... Wait, they didn't have masks either. How could they think to come so unprepared?

"Ready men!" commanded Hanson. "Fire!"

Oh no. Realization hit me a moment too late. The six men pushed together, trapping my head between their posteriors as they all ripped the most vile, wretched ass I have ever smelled.  I should have seen it coming, the whole team ordering Taco Bell together for lunch. I gagged and tried to hold my breath but I was overcome.

"Happy retirement you old fart" said Kuiper, trying not to giggle like a school girl.

"I love you guys, and I'm gonna miss you." I gasped. "Now get the hell out of my house."
