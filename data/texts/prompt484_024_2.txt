I lost rrack of how long its been, its not like I can do anything. A little back story is nessicary I guess. My life before time froze was bad, terrible really so I decided to end it. I knew the rouge planet was on its way here but I couldn't wait any longer. I figured nobody would care if I was dead when everybody was going to die. So I walked to the top of a building I thought was tall enough and... well I
 jumped at first it was really fast but the further down I got the slower I fell. I thought maybe this was a normal thing, its not like we know much about dieing until it happens to us, so I rolled with it. That is until I hit the ground it was slow... very, very slow. I watched my legs snap, I watched my bones punch out through my flesh and before you ask, yes it was painful I didn't think it could get worse but I was soon proven wrong. I felt my spine shatter to pieces which was painful for a second but then it stopped. Next to be introduced to the pavement was my face my nose got crushed but I felt nothing. My neck bent sideways facing the bulding that was my escape. My arm collided with the street in front of my face and it was all I could see. As soon as I thought it couldn't get worse my arm began to glow blue and words were burned in to my flesh, the strangest part was that I felt each letter sear into my arm even thought the rest of my body was numb it read "no matter how long it takes, save us". As that happend things stopped slowing down... it stopped, I could feel it, time had stopped and I was meant to accomplish something. This made me feel good my pointless life was replaced with this meaningful one. But then my stomach dropped, I couldnt move... I was paralyzed from the fall.
