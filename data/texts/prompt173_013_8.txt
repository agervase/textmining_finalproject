"Peace? Surely they're intelligent enough to know that the cause of all war is peace." The alien sighed, "They can build such art and technology, but are foolish enough to not notice that the thing they seek to end their problems is their problem."


"It is amusing is it not?" The other replied, "They also fear death, and because of that fear they are willing to make the life of anyone else worse. I wonder every day what they think complete peace feels like."


"Amusing to a certain perspective. I think you've been watching these creatures too long. Certainly they can't all be this backwards. If there are people who can invent the tools they use certainly some of them could invent some sense of the world they live in. Please don't tell me they have never grasped at the value of the difference and the unknown."


"Oh yes," The still smiling alien replied, "Humans realize all the time that this peace they wish for is oblivion. The other humans kill them for these thoughts, or more recently drive the thinkers to kill themselves."


The first alien finally smiled, "Now I see your interest in this planet. That is possibly the purest death cultus I've heard of, and all the while adversarial. Remarkable."

"And you haven't even heard about how they got here. They used to have gods that they gave flesh too, then they tricked them into taking the bones and fat. Not a century later they were killing each other over that flesh. Now today they're rituals are so advanced that they need no flesh at all. Quite the trick they played was it not?"

The first alien, now quite convinced that this planet was indeed worth watching, laughed and sat down next to the seasoned regular, "And I here I was ready to return to observing the macrophagic super storms on crixtus 6. You'll have to explain more of the backstory or I'll be totally lost."
