Aw shit they called upon the mister big dick swang  
But no mistake, not why it’s named the Biggest Bang  
Scientists saying it began with a yin-yang  
But then the energetic shit changed in massive ways,  
The earth a giant sauna of hot lava most violent  
Meteorites did cool it off as they collided  
Gravity guided, grabbing pieces less divided  
Physics provided a non-lopsided horizon,  
Spinning for a couple billion years enough  
Single-celled shells of life, well, bacteria  
Pangea, Nigeria and Syria form along with Siberia  
A myriad of life springs up, main criteria,  
At first just a few animals, mammals, and dinosaurs  
Big enough to thrust and make the earth’s crusty vagina sore  
Evolutions and extinctions, there were at least 5 or more  
The comet wiped the life to the core, science is kinda sure,  
Before humans there were forests huge and an Ice Age  
The many fumes and humid fuels is where we might gauge  
The mammals we think of as distinctive in the right ways  
Similar too to ones in the zoo that we tight cage,  
Through generations of mutants hanging apes became humans  
Homo erectus usage of fire not too foolish  
Homo sapiens came and the brain remained bloomin’  
We were less fluid and movin’ and reducing our confusion,  
As we grow, splits, dynasties, different societies  
Varieties of beliefs, gods, demons, and violent themes  
Anxieties and sacrifices to put minds at ease  
These kinds of things that divide into modern diocese,  
Then kings queens and presidents the rest of it irrelevant  
The rise and fall of all involved and rarely were they delicate  
Arrogant elegant delegates preaching etiquette  
Decadent non-immigrant prejudiced against melanin,  
Which leads thee to me, the most god-like Klondike  
That anyone would do anything to be more a-like  
Small tykes and blonde dykes in long lines for song right  
Into their noggins from the most King-Kong white *beat stops*  
Motherfucker to buy a house with a draw-bridge to keep the garbage from constantly asking more about his moms life, am I not right? Am I wrong? Come on, bite, I’ll turn your alien evening out into a long night
