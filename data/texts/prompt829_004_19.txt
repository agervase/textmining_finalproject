It must be Thursday.  Ba’al, like Arthur Dent, never quite got the hang of Thursdays.  He had been Summoned, out of bed, out of his loving wife’s arms, and into a Summoning.  “Let me get this straight,” he intoned, wanting clarification. “You want me to come tomorrow night to your gathering to *play* a game.  A game with lots of books and knowledge and dice and imagination, wherein, I will ‘run’ this ‘dungeon’.  You *Summoned* a Prince of Hell, specifically the Demon Prince of Contracts and Binding, so that one of your other players cannot *cheat* his way through by superior knowledge of rules.”  Ba’al Berith *sighed*, at least this was *different*.

One of the humans stepped forward, “Yes, Lord Ba’al Berith.  You have the right of it.”  They all pointedly ignored that Ba’al was dressed in satin pajama bottoms and fluffy bunny slippers and his robe wasn’t a darkened mantel of power, but a cushy plush bathrobe.  They had *obviously* summoned him from bed and he made sure they knew it.

Ba’al *did **NOT*** like cheaters and it would be a nice break from the proceedings.  His cell phone rang; it was his wife.  Answering, he made some agreeable noises, thinking of stopping by the coffee shop and grabbing some breakfast for her on the way home.  “My wife wants to know if she can come play,” he simply stated, hanging up.and slipping the phone delicately back into his pocket.

“As long as there is no blatant favoritism,”the human agreed.  He had introduced himself as John, and once the agreement would be started, the others would get introduced to Ba’al.  “I mean, we know how relationships work, Lord Ba’al Berith.  No one wants to go home with an angry girlfriend.”  The others all nodded, piping up about how their own girlfriends had “tried” Dungeons and Dragons and found it… lacking in stimulation compared to other hobbies like anime and video games.

“Then, I insist, no more ‘Lord’ this and that,” Ba’al stated.  “If we’re to be friends, just call me Ba’al.”
