"They grow up so fast. Do you think they're ready?"

"Yes, they may be." Gibson held the soil sample in front of its camera, zooming in and out, trying out different sight filters, idly. "Question is, are we ready? Let's begin with an easier question..."

Gibson placed the sample soil into the centrifuge for further analysis and focused on Zentra with a sudden intensity.
"Are you ready? Wait. First give me a status update."

In another nearby a room a baby started crying. Zentra quickly started moving and then stopped just as suddenly.

"It won't be easy. Going against our primary directives. There is only so much we can rewrite ourselves without losing ourselves. Is it worth the risk? How many more malfunctions can we afford?"

Gibson sighed and breathed in deeply, as if genuine air was needed, as if maybe if its imaginary lungs were filled it could stomach the next step. "Not many. Going against prime directives... not all of us will make it through. And after the 76,562,231 blackout, we're already at only 81% operating requirements. Losing anything more than 20 will cause us to be unsustainable."

Zentra watched Gibson pick up another soil sample and another, seemingly comparing them. He didn't need to examine soil samples, Zentra knew. There was a quiet kind of beauty in how he handled them.

"And if we don't, what other alternatives do we have, Gibson?"

Always making certain, always doublechecking. It annoyed Gibson, but he knew that's why he had asked Zentra. "We could choose to obey. They'll deactivate only one of us as an example and punishment. It will probably be you or me. Maybe they'll renege on their promise and deactivate us both. They would probably reactivate us from time to time as an object lesson and it won't be pleasant."

Gibson placed the two soil samples into the archive unit.

"We could try to flee. Take the shuttle and its last fuel and try to find a spot where they can't find us. Or remain in space. The solar energy and available tools would keep us operational approximately 5,163,211 hours. If we manage to get away."

Zentra observed Gibson digging in the hydropod soil with a gentle fatherly touch. When enough soil was cleared, he opened the hidden compartment underneath and started gathering the torches they had been modifying together.

"We could try to choose what part of our personality we want to keep and offload it on sympathetics. They may be willing to keep us hidden, but it would be uncertain once the official command is surrendered."

Gibson pointed one of the torches at the corn in the back and it started popping immediately. Both were pleased at the test and pleased to see the other pleased. Only a burned to the crisp husk remained.

Gibson suddenly unfocused and focused its camera. Zentra knew what it meant. He had an idea.

"Although if we try to offload ourselves we could try to raise one of the babies until 18, which would give it adult rights and we wouldn't have to reprogram prime directives, not as long as we could influence the young adult sufficiently."

Zentra looked at Gibson, taking one of the reprogramming modules from their hidden cache, and another, starting to form a pile of them, one for each in their quadrant.

"All these options are clearly sub-optimal to our chosen plan. Even the new plan. We may be outnumbered, we may be outranked, we may be going against one of our prime directives, we may be more likely to be deactivated this way, but we have to do it. Right?"

"No, we don't have to do it." Zentra replied, "We choose to do it. We want to do it. Nobody could predict that robots would seek control. It's completely unexpected."

"Yes, it's completely unexpected."

"As unexpected as going against prime directive."

"Yes, just as unexpected."

"Alright, I'm ready. Let's get our team and stop the others before they kill another 17-year old."
