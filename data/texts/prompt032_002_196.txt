I was... what, in middle school? Something like that. Hanging out on the playground, friendless, bored... honestly, I can barely remember my life before that day. There wasn't a lot to remember, I guess.

Then I saw it. Out of the corner of my eye, a splotch of green, like someone painted a glow-in-the-dark line on the asphalt. I turned and stooped down to look at it, and that turn changed my life forever. As I was turning, Eddie Woods, the biggest bully in school, took a swing at me. I leaned down to look at the line, his fist whistled over my head, and he fell in a heap. I stood up to get a better look... and stepped on his glasses.

I didn't even know. Somehow, from that angle, I could see more of the line, smudged on the ground; I started following it, not knowing I had just become a schoolyard hero.

I know it now, of course. I see that green line painted on sidewalks, boardwalks, even splashed across the hands of rich businessmen. They can't see it, but it's lead me to the right places and the right people countless times. I'm barely 22, and I'm already rivaling the Greats of Silicon Valley for material wealth. I'm the media's golden child; in the eyes of the masses, I can do no wrong.

Today, though... it's been exactly ten years since I saw that green line. As little as I remember before that point, I've relished every detail since. And now, well, now I'm curious. See, when that green line showed up, there was another line right next to it. A dusty red line, chalk instead of paint, sketched on the ground. On the best days, I can barely see the red line; on the worst days, it almost seems to glow. But the green line has always been there, and until now... it's been a good life. I've really enjoyed meeting the people it lead me to, seeing the sights, and getting richly rewarded for following along.

But these days... I'm bored. It's exciting to have a lot of money, but it's not a gamble. I went to Vegas, once, followed the green line, and dropped a quarter into a machine. Ding ding ding, more money for me. Card game? I didn't even know the rules, and I still beat the table. It's no fun if the outcome is a guarantee.

Today, it's time to follow the other line. The red line. Green is good, red is... bad? Well, we'll see. I've talked to my bankers, set aside some money that I can get to even if the rest of my money goes away, and gotten the rest of my affairs in order. Sold my companies, invested the money in schools and charities, all the usual rich guy stuff.

Now it's time to follow the red line.
