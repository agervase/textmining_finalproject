The only safehaven of reality is those of us who were able to believe upon our own lies: the self deceptors.  Lucky us.

The detection of a lie hinges upon the awareness of truth, and its willful avoidance.  Some of us, however, are so far gone that we are not, on a conscious level, aware of our lies.  Or we at least do not accept them.  We believe what we say, or are at least convinced of what we say.

What is a lie?  What is that which we are most ashamed of?  Treason?  Incest?  Violence?  With the truth of our sins brandished upon our foreheads, there is none more eloquent than the lost; we know not of our sins and our chaos, we simply exist.

Existence is all that any living creature hopes for.  Continuing existence is the last wish of the tortured soul.  Torture is still existence, and in its own twisted sense, pain is a realization of existence.

As a person who has hidden a horrible lie for my entire life, the sudden realization that almost everyones lies have been stripped from them, presents only ONE logical course:  Rather than continuing my lie while those with the same lie are being exposed, this is an opportunity.  I have a super power; I can control what of my lies becomes publicized and which I keep to myself.

I immediately confess to that which I judge to be "mainstream" secrets, as cover to my REAL travesties.  You see, I'm much worse than an ordinary individual, but I can not maintain the charade of a saint.  Everyone knows there's something wrong with me, but now I have the power to tell them what it is.

I immediately confess to the least of my sins, maintain the deception of my greater sins, and ultimately continue to live a life of paranoia and secrecy.
