Edward Snowman was afraid. Simply put he was afraid of journeying into the unknown.he would had to leave, that was for sure. But how far would he need to go to be safe? Santa could travel most anywhere in a matter of seconds, he had a global surveillance network. As much as he didn't want to be knew the only place he'd be safe was at the South Pole, the old rival of his current home. It was the aforementioned surveillance that was the reason he was doing this. He couldn't watch all of those children laying out cakes and whisky for the man who was also raking in profit by selling information on them to the highest bidder.
It had stated quite innocently. There was a brief shortage of money, he was going to let some of the elves go, but then the agent arrived, he convinced St Nick to sell some of the information from his network to catch a terrorist. It seemed relatively benign, getting a bit of cash by helping a good cause.                                                                           It had spiralled out of control, nothing was safe from Santa's all seeing eyes. He would sell to anyone, if the price was right. That was what Snowman knew, and what the world needed to find out. He had taken a reindeer and was now getting ready to say his goodbyes and leak all of Santa's dodgy dealings onto the inter flake. He pulled his laptop out, he'd sneakily taken it from a production line the week before. He prepared it all, then, gingerly, hit enter, there, it was done, posted onto thousands of different flake sites. It was all quicker than he'd expected, around a minute into his journey to his parents candyhouse, sirens sounded and red lights overshadowed the northern lights. He felt a cold tear slide down his cheek as he realised his old life was over, he pulled the reins around and shot off into the night.
