The hourglass had rolled to its side, its content perfectly balanced on both sides, a potential eternity in the shape of a few still grains of sand.

Death rolled it between his fingers, the dry, bleached bones clicking against dusty, bubbly glass. The sand inside was a dark, coarse thing, tinged with the black of volcanic ashes and the red of granit dust, clumped by time. Next to it, vivid contrast, is the crystalline emptiness of Death own hourglass.

That thing was Ancient, even for Death, and it's with something akin to reverence that he laid it on his desk, carefully maintaining its balance on the side. It's so old than the name carved on the bronze plaque has disappeared under the dust. Never had such a thing happened before to him, not in this unlife nor in any others, for Death had already lived many existences and would carry on living many others through worlds and time, He the Reaper that existed in the cusp of eternity.

Again the tapping of bones against glass and a sound that could have been a sigh. Who could it be, and what would have become of them ? Someone that had lived for so long, nearly as long as himself, someone that had experienced everything life had to offer but never had to pay the price of mortality for it. Would he find a king, his will unyielding and forged through millenias of ruling, or a beggar, crazed by an unending existence of loss and misery ?

Since the beginning the pact had been simple. They would be born and live, wax and wane out of existence and always Death would be there at the end, but this time there had not been any end, at least so far. With a shrug, Death went on to collect what he was owed.

Grass under his heels and the heavy buzzing of bees welcoming him. The garden was lush with life, teeming with the sounds and the exuberancy of Nature nurtured. A work unending but a reward in itself, as Death took in the trees basking in the sun, the almost cloying scent of flowers still damp from some previous rain, and the small silhouette in the clearing, waiting near a table.

&#x200B;

" I had been waiting for so long, I thought it would never happen but you are here, finally. Tell me, do we have time for tea ?"

&#x200B;

The man pulls out a chair and Death sits. It's not uncommon to have people try to negociate with him, to coax him into relenting but the warm smile is sincere, devoid of any duplicity. Death feels welcome here, in this haven of peace and life and so he sits  and contemplate his duty as the man starts to fuss around them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The face is ageless but the hands aren't, worn and twisted by work but still strong as the man deftly pours tea in mismatched cups. A bee, more curious than others land near a pot filled with honey and he gently shoos it away, using a dollop of the sweet nectar to distract it.

Once done the man sits, facing Death, lifting his cup in wordless cheer among the garden. Together they drink in silence, the man peaceful in front of his Death. Then they talk, for hours, for ages, sky and sun and stars dancing among them, and Death revels in this unusual sensation, of having someone made so similar to him by a mere twist of Fate. In this place, made almost perfect in its natural beauty where time has all but lost its sense Death takes a decision.

&#x200B;

" I have only come for tea, and a chat. You know how eternity can be long sometimes."

Wordlessly the man nods

" But I will come back in your garden, if you allow it ?"

&#x200B;

" Of course, my friend, you will always be welcome."

&#x200B;

On top of Death desk sits a dusty hourglass, laying on its side, untouched. The name on the plaque has long disappeared but if one day someone was to ask whose it is, Death would only answer

&#x200B;

" A Friend."
