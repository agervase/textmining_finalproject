The cellar never used to smell like blood.

Kate stacked her bottles just right and kept a fine stock of fortified wine for cold winter nights. She sorted them by the aroma, from fruity to earthy. Her categorisation was now divided by a brand new upright freezer with her husband’s foot poking out.

She wrapped her hands around his toes and tugged. He landed with a thud and slid on crunchy ice still layering his pyjamas.

Kate tiptoed over her husband and began writing on the notepad on top of the freezer.

*Darling,*

*The doctor said my stitches are almost ready to come out! Your little ritual did a number on the wounds, but your resurrective healing could use some work. You’ll probably be mad at me but I took the weekend shift. The Anderson’s had a barbeque, I told them you were away for a news story so you’re covered.*

*I called Simon this morning, he doesn’t know what electives he will choose next semester. He wants to come home for the summer, we’re going to have to hash out a plan. We might have to speed up the shift changes, make up a family emergency for one of us perhaps? Oh, and he drinks now, legally anyway. You’re stronger so you may have to move the freezer.*

*Wake me up on Tuesday, I don’t want to miss pilates with Hannah.*

*Love you always,*

*Kate*

*PS. I let Mr Pips out.*

Kate left the pen on the notepad and dragged Michael to the pentagram next to the merlots. She remembers seeing him slaughtered in the demonic circle each time she crosses the threshold. His blood, everywhere. A surprisingly large amount for such a small guy. *Good on you, honey.* Mr Pips was thoroughly helping with cleanup duty, lapping it up like a bowl of milk.

Kate began the incantation. She noticed Mr Pips on the top shelf, purring in anticipation. Her life energy flowed into her husband's corpse as shivers of movement re-entered his limbs. She saw life in his eyes again as hers went dark.
