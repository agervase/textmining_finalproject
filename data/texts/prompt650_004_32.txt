**Item** #: SCP-001

**Object Class:** ~~Apollyon~~ ~~Neutralized~~ Safe (See addendum 1)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001-A is to be stored in a standard secure locker at Site 19.

Areas extending 50 meters from points where instances of SCP-001-B were neutralized are to be surrounded by secure perimeters, continuously monitored for any activity at all times by no less than two guards. Should any containment area be breached, task force MTF Lambda-5 is to be mobilized immediately and follow procedure RC-001. 

Should any four instances of SCP-001-B be brought together at any point, XK-001 protocol[1] is to be enacted by any Foundation senior administration member, any Foundation personnel directly involved in containment of SCP-001 or, should none of the above be available, any Foundation personnel aware of the event.

In the event any intact instance of SCP-001-B is retrieved or recaptured, it is to be transported to a location on solid land no closer than 30 km from any inhabited area and neutralized immediately.


**Description**:
SCP-001-A is an articulated gauntlet made of unknown copper-colored metallic substance[2] exhibiting extreme resistance to any non-anomalous force (see Testing Log 001-A-1). It is decorated in a variety of designs, 36.5 cm long, and too large for human hands, though it is capable of resizing to fit the wearer when equipped with any instance of SCP-001-B. There are six sockets on the glove, one above each major knuckle, and one above the middle of the hand. By itself, SCP-001-A is incapable of any anomalous actions other than the ones listed above, but it serves as a receptacle for instances of SCP-001-B.

There are six known instances of SCP-001-B. Instances of SCP-001-B grant the user a limited control over phenomena mentioned in their designation (full capabilities listed in >!REDACTED!<). Each instance was originally found in a containment device capable of channeling it's powers. When removed from a containment device, each instance can seemingly be used in a limited fashion by a trained individual (see >!REDACTED!<), but the only known containment device capable of using multiple instances of SCP-001-B is SCP-001-A. In order to install an instance SCP-001-B into SCP-001-A, the object is to be brought into contact with an empty socket, at which point the crystal will reshape to fit it.

Most instances of SCP-001-B abide by certain restrictions. They can only affect an area nearby (except B-2), their effects are temporary (except B-5 and B-6), limited to single plane of reality (except B-3) and limited in scope.

All instances of SCP-001-B, as well as, to a lesser extent, SCP-001-A and it's wielder, are immune to direct temporal or reality manipulation, save by either other SCP-001-B instances or by reality benders generated by them. However, their environment, wielders not using SCP-001-A, and containment devices other than SCP-001-A lack this protection.

The following table contains identifying information of each SCP-001-B instance discovered so far, as well as their method of neutralization. For sites of neutralization, as well as detailed logs and methods, see Document 001-ST.

|SCP NUMBER|DESIGNATION|ORIGINAL CONTAINMENT|APPEARANCE|METHOD OF NEUTRALIZATION|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|SCP-001-B-1|Power Stone|The Orb - Spherical object with cavity in the middle, containing the instance|Purple Gem|Destroyed by a reality bender generated by SCP-001-B-6. Resulting explosion was then masked as a >!REDACTED!<.
|SCP-001-B-2|Space Stome|The Tesseract - See >!REDACTED!< and information on GOI-Hydra|Blue Gem|Annihilated when moved into an anomalous area with 3 temporal and 1 spatial dimensions generated by SCP->!REDACTED!<
|SCP-001-B-3|Reality Stone|The Aether - Red liquid, self-suspended in the air, capable of entering a host.|Red Gem|SCP-001-B-3 was returned to its previous form, and allowed to enter a host. The existence of the host was nullified using >!REDACTED!<
|SCP-001-B-4|Soul Stone|>!REDACTED!<|Orange Gem|Following neutralization of original wielder of SCP-001, the instance reportedly disappeared. Given original method of acquisition, it is thought that the instance returned to it's original containment location.||
|SCP-001-B-5|Time Stone|The Eye of Agamotto - See >!REDACTED!<.|Green Gem|See addendum 1||
|SCP-001-B-6|Mind Stone|See Incident Report: 4-5-12-NY|Yellow Gem|Destroyed by a reality bender generated by SCP-001-B-6.||


When used together, instances of SCP-001-B interact with eachother, seemingly lifting restrictions placed on them. Moreover, as the number of instances used together grows, so does their collective capability. Should all instances be brought together and used by a being of exceptional will, it is thought that they would be capable of causing wide range of K-class scenarios, possibly including ZK Reality Failure scenario.

> I don't think we need to stress this for anyone who survived the first Event 001, but I am still noting this here for posterity - no matter how tempting, do NOT ever try to reassemble this thing. It goes straight though Scranton Reality Anchors, it ignores reality benders, hell, it even killed [that damn lizard](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682). We decided to neutralize it for a very good reason and, if you found this file in some temporal cache, or amidst the ruins of civilization, trust us, the most cynical group in history - the cost WOULD be too great. -O5-7

**Addendum 1**:

FOR O5/001 CONTAINMENT TEAM EYES ONLY

 >!Originally, SCP-001-B-5 was neutralized by keeping it locked in a paradoxical time loop. However, since then it has been spotted several times, wielded by various individuals in a variety of makeshift containment devices. Given nature of the object, it's possible that, in that instance's timeline, it has not been contained yet, but as it is impossible to verify the status of containment this could not be confirmed. No attempt has been made to re-capture SCP-001-B-5, for the fear of altering timeline of SCP-001, but re-containment procedures should be enacted if anyone attempts to use this object to restore any SCP-001-B instances. !<

>!Following Event 001-A, SCP-001 was classified as Apollyon. After neutralization of SCP-001-B instances, it was classified as Neutralized, but due to discovery of additional SCP-001-B-5 instances the objects have been reclassified as Safe.!<

For purposes of this entry, it authorizes highest ranking remaining Foundation member to utilize >!REDACTED!< class of Foundation assets, enact Broken Masquerade scenario or >!READACTED!<.

[2]. Information gathered from GOI->!REDACTED!<, as well as analysis using SCP->!REDACTED!< indicates that the material forming SCP-001-A is called "Uru", and that it is some form of degenerate matter, although further testing is pending O5 approval.
