**SHE KNOWS**

*Shut the fuck up Oscar, this happens all the time!  It's a coincidence, there's prob-* my conversation with the six foot tall penguin trails off as I look around for something else on the ice rink that resembles a penguin.  But there's nothing: no logo, no one's clothes, not even the word spelled out.

"Hello?  Earth to Gurt!" Allison smiles and raps her knuckles again my forehead, as if knocking on a door.  I shake my head and stare at her, trying to examine her face for any obvious tell that she's lying.  But nothing.

"S-sorry, I don't see what you're talking about, what looks like a penguin?"  I say quickly, stammering nervously as I try to recompose myself.  I look at Oscar and he stares back at me.  Reading a penguin's expression is hard, but after a few yea-

**SHE KNOWS**

*Oscar!  Shut the fuck up!  It's hard enough to think on a date, let alone whe-*

**BUT SHE KNOWS**

"What's its name?" she cautiously interjects, gently gliding a couple inches away from me on the ice.  She retrieves her phone from her coat pocket, and points the camera at Oscar and I.  I resume my panicked conversation, desperately avoiding her call out to Oscar.

"Whose name?  I'm sorry, I don't know what we're talking abo-"

"Jackass, we're talking about the six foot penguin standing to your left!" she exasperates before sipping some of her hot chocolate, dissatisfied with whatever picture she took of Oscar.

**SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SHE KN-**

My anxiety starts to go nuclear as the bird begins shifting his legs and fidgeting, very clearly upset.  *Oscar, calm down!  It's not like she can prove y-*

The world begins to slow as I hear the sound of a wet whoopie cushion, an almost perfect raspberry.  Turning to face Allison, I watch in both horror and amazement as she sprays hot chocolate all over Oscar.

"See?  The hot chocolate never touched the ice beyond that spot!" she emphatically points to the penguin's feet "You can't deny *that*!" She smirks, proud of her solution.  I had to admit, it was brilliant.  Almost as good as the time *I* tried taking a picture of Oscar.

"His name is Oscar.  He's followed me my whole life.  I can talk to him telepathically, but he's tight lipped.  Never told me the where, what, or why of following me.  Said it was a good reason, so I believed him."

"So I'm the only other person you've ever met who can see him too?" she skates back up to me, but looks over the six foot Emperor.  "Oh, I'm sorry about the hot chocolate, Oscar!"

**SHE IS NICE I LIKE HER**

I can't help but laugh.  Twenty years of being told I'm schizophrenic or lying or whatever, and finally someone to share half my life with.  "He said he likes you."  She gives a silly squeak amidst laughing before replying.

"I'm glad you won't have to dump me for him.  *Wait*, has that happened to you before!?"  Allison whips her head around, looking back at me.  I heave a sigh.

"Yes.  Some girls found out and obsessed over it, everything was always about Oscar.  When people assume all my problems trace back to Oscar, it can be demeaning.  For him too, he may look tough but his feathers ruffle easy."

**KAREN WAS A BITCH AND YOU KNOW IT**

*Yeah, but that's not what Allison wants to hear.*

"So what happens when people bump into him?  Is it one of those things where they internally justify it unknowingly, or what?"

"I don't know.  Sometimes he can Kitty Pride his way through things, other times he is physical."  

"But what about..."

Her questions trailed on, and I enjoyed the rest of our time on the ice.  Afterwards as I was lighting the blunt in her car, she was regaling me with the story of her first time being drunk.  

"...so Meg and I are in the top bunk, Jacey is trying to find an outlet for the laptop charger when..." she stopped, somewhat suddenly.  I looked at her, then at Oscar.  He seemed just as confused.  "Who is that?" her finger pressed against her window, she points into the ice rink parking lot.  

The silhouette of a person is careening towards us, much faster than people should be able to run.  Allison throws the car in drive, but the tires spin tractionless in the snow.  The silhouette's right arm reaches up to the sky, then begins to extend.  The massive limb fly's directly at us like an arrow, piercing the hood of the car and digging around the insides.  The sound was horrible, like someone dropped a brick in a blender.  

I shake my head and realize I hadn't been listening to either Allison scream "Jesus Christ" over and over, or Oscar in my head.

**THEY FOUND ME THEY FOUND ME THEY FOUND ME**

*What the fuck!  Who found you?!  Why were they looking!?*

Before he answers, the massive bird climbs out of the back of the car and waddles over to the silhouette.  Much closer now, our assailant comes into view and I take in its appearance.  What I assume is the head looks like a staple remover with enough cables protruding from the inside to wire a server farm.  Its torso and legs look made of the same plastic as modern cars, but with the patterns of a spray sand ceiling.  The arms were metallic tentacles with a sheen that looked surreal, ending in six pronged claws.

Oscar slapped away the machine's left appendage as he approached it, pecking wildly at wires.  The thing barely has time to react, pulling its right claw from the hood of Allison's car.  The two phenomenon fought back and forth for what felt like minutes, until the monster's claws raked across Oscar's chest.  A painful squawk releases from his beak as he collapsed on his back.

I screamed as I jumped out of the car, running at the anomaly with an ice skate over my head, a make shift boxing glove.  Apparently the machine never expected Allison or me to do anything, because I ran up behind the beast and slashes at a few important looking wires.  

The creature made a sound like a dial up modem before turning around and slapping me in the shins, knocking me off my feet and onto my side.  The metal menace stood over me as I tried to do anything other than breathe and shake.  

I heard Allison yell something profane, then the machine made another painful squeal.  The automaton was not a gentleman and hit Allison in the stomach, and she doubled over clutching herself.  

**GOODBYE GURT THANK YOU**

*Oscar?  Stop, I don't know what's going on!*  

But my pleas fell on deaf ears.  Oscar waddled over to the robot and grabbed it by the wrists, holding one in each wing.  The machine tried to bite the penguin, but couldn't reach him.  Oscar's eyes began to glow green like Greek fire, and a low hum built in his throat.  His beak opened slowly and meticulously, and a high pitched squark louder than a jet engine echoed through the air as a brilliant laser eviscerated the one time silhouette.  

When my ears stopped ringing and my eyesight returned, Allison was hugging me, and we were alone in the snowy parking lot.

"Hey," she said, half a whisper and half a plea "let's go finish that blunt in your car."
