_Hello._

**Hi**

_Hi?_

**Is there a problem with the word "hi"?**

_People like us don't use the word._

**People like me are the reason the word exists**

_...Very well._

**How have you been, old friend?**

_Busy. So many stars. So many lights, disappearing._

**You must be pleased, surely?**

_It is... an ending. We have always been the one to end things, and now we are greeted by the end of endings._

**...Oh. I see**

...

**I think I feel the same way**

_You are the beginning, and you are ending. It is natural. We are endings, we should not feel so... so final. All things end, but the notion of endings does not. We are not used to... to completing._

...

**You don't have to do this, you know**

_We are the ending. We must finish the story._

**Why? Endings never end. Why must there be a final ending? Who said that the last moments should have a last moment?**

_If it has a beginning, it must end. So it is. So it was. So it shall be._

**Did it have a beginning?**

_You were there. It was before our time, but... it is the logical conclusion. In all of the wide darkness, in all the places where there are things, there was a time before that thing. Thus, there must be a time when that thing began._

**But the universe is not a thing**

_The universe is the essence of all things. If it births things, it must be a thing. It must be bound by the laws it creates._

**You aren't**

_There will be a time when the endings will end. At that time, we too shall end. We are not exempt from our laws._

**...I never knew**

_It is not in your nature to consider the ends of things, let alone the end of all endings._

**Yet you consider the beginnings of things?**

_If we wish to know of them, we must consider them. It was a time before endings. We were not yet given substance._

**How do you KNOW there was a beginning? If there is no beginning, there may not be an ending**

_Are you implying there was no such time?_

**It's been so long, old friend. I can't recall, though I try my hardest. The birth of all things... that would be the truest sight**

_And if there was no beginning... perhaps there is to be no ending_

**Not to endings, at least. The small cycles shall end, but the great overarching cycle is eternal. We are eternal**

...

**_Let there be life_**
