After waking back into what is, I couldn't move. I was frozen. 

There was nothing but awe, and entirely consumed by it. I was slowly working to merge what I saw and what is in front of me.
There's little that could be said.

I could question it to no end, whether it was real or not, whether this was real or not. There was no way to tell. 

There was just awe.

My entire notion of the perception was transformed.
What could I say, to whom could I say it to? Having seen that which only could be described in a language that was also dreamt of, there was no one who could speak it, not having been there.

This created a strange loneliness in me. 

I was stranded forever in the visions that visited me, with no one to give company there or to rescue me in being here.

Not being able to reach a conclusion on how to feel about it, I then resolved to the next immediate question: What should I do now?

Should I work to bring about the world that I visited? or realize that I had little but to swing about, because the natural progression of things would bring it about anyway.

The awe was receding, slowly being replaced by a nagging feeling of being stuck.
Like a fly caught in a glue trap. Every thought now felt impeded by something.
I couldn't move at all now, and I didn't know how to justify my acts. 

It started to feel like it was a curse all along.
I was torn from the fabric of my bretheren, the coherence I once took for granted. It was now replaced with a knowledge that I couldn't share.
I was irrecoverably separated from my communion, the unity. 
Being cast out of Eden, the simple existence, the kind that my ancestors enjoyed, to live and perish, is now gone.

I sat, mouth agape. Unable to move. Frozen.

Then with no preceding thought, I stretched out his hand, and knew what I wanted; friends.

I reached for another mushroom, hoping that it would erase the memory of the last one.
