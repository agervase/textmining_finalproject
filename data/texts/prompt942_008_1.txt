Xecutyl smiled broadly, though feeling slightly feverish, at the blessing brought to him--shown to him through his sleep visions.  The design; the grand design!  For so long they had stagnated in Mexica and Aztec lands--no longer!  It might be some many years, but the design was shown to him, and he would spread his vision with his people.  They would become great conquerors again, and on a scale not yet seen by any nation.

Mathew O' Heaney was the first to see it, and what he saw floored him for long moments.  His job as sentry almost forgotten, with the armada of...ships...that lumbered forward through the seas.  These ships:  they had no masts!  How could this be?  He roused 
Thomas, sleeping and drunk, to action.  

"Wake the guard, wake the damned guard Thomas; ships coming in, at least twenty that I can see.  Jehsus Christ, but they're so strange looking."

Mathew brought the spyglass to his eye again, looking out to the large ships.  They, for all the world, looked to be made of stone.  They were painted in garish colors, lurid greens and bright, sunshine yellows and oranges--reds splashed throughout, as if doused in precise patterns of blood.  Sun symbols marked the strange prows, and still awed by all this, was the fact that they came forward without masts and sails to harness the winds.  How, by God, could this be?  

Hours later, though the might of their land locked armies and fledgling navy tried as they might to repel the invaders, most of the Western coast of Ireland fell to the savage invaders, calling themselves the Aztec.  In less than two weeks, the invaders and put the Northern and Southern coasts under heel, and swept through the Isle of the Sun, as Ireland was now to be called.

The savage leader, Xecutyl he had called himself--barely pronounceable, disgusting!--had a blood curdling smile on his face.  It might make one wet themselves or wail in fear, if one were weak souled enough.  Francois De'Breayn was not such a man, and yet, as he knelt before the savage, even he trembled slightly.  The blood of many brave members of the French legion had fallen this day.  The Winelands; proud France was reduced now to such a name, in principal if not yet in name and fact.  Francois had heard tell that Spain had fallen as well; heard the once proud nation reduced to the name of the Redeemed lands.  The rest of Europe would fall, and though he knew he would die this day, he decided to smile.  Time seemed to slow as the blade began a slow arc towards Francois' neck.  He hoped he could match the conqueror's smile; he would die with a modicum of respect showing in his features, and hoped it could give at least some consternation to the brute.  Yes, he smiled, as he wondered if even this heathen force of conquerors could brave the lands of Prussia, much less overtake them.  It was the last thought he had, and it gave him a sort of peace as that wicked, curved blade seemed to float through the air as snow lazily falling to the ground.
