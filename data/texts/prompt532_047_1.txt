"C'mon, just die already!"

"I don't want to! You die!"

"I'm only 84 years old, Greats, you're 347!" Your kid died and so did most of your grandchildren, when are you going to grow up?"

My descendant looked with a stern, patronizing face to a man who can't keep up with the times. "I don't wanna..." escaped my lips quietly, with nothing else to add. 

"You're dying Friday and that's final." His last words hit like a stiff jab as he got up from the bed and stormed out the room.

Here I lay, staring at my room. As the front door to my home closes with my source of stress, the only sound and movement came from the ceiling fan. Oh the loneliness. It's so much beautiful than anything waiting for me after.

*Day after*

After many hours of rebelling against my many grandchildren, my legs had grown too tired to hold onto dear life as I am forced out of my house and into a funeral van. Tears are streaming down my eyes as I cannot hold my composure. "You fucking worthless, evil little bastards!" They all looked solemnly at the dead man. I should have known my children would kill me. I just didn't know my one and only could repopulate like this. 
As we pull up to the outgoing clients building, out front on the lawn there is a funeral service set up. I heavily and also vaguely remember most of the faces in attendance. My portrait was placed right beside my coffin I had not had the opportunity to meet yet. These future funerals are some shit. I guess they euthanize these outgoing people and stick them right in their coffin right afterwards to make the ceremony that much quicker.

Yada yada, I got euthanized and went to hell.
