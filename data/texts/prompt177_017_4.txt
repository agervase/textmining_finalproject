I stood with their cooling bodies at my back, between them and the slavering horde. The Demons had taken my Brothers and Sisters. I was the last of the Order. But so long as one still stood, the Vanguard would hold. 

Lance held strong, feet sure, spirit ablaze with furor, I charged the horde. CLANG! CLANG! My lance brushed harmlessly off their armored hides, as they merely sat there laughing at me in their rumbling guttural language. The tongue of demons held no sway over a Sister, though. Hold! I would not fall, would not shame my fallen family. HOLD THE LINE!

A voice rang over the din, distant and far. I could barely understand it, through the haze of battle. 

^^^"Jesus ^^^CHRIST, ^^^you ^^^old ^^^bitch, ^^^get ^^^the ^^^fuck ^^^off ^^^my ^^^car!"

A distraction... a trick! I struck again with my lance, roaring defiance and bloodlust as I hammered the demons. Dented their armor, smashed out their glimmering eyes, kicked them for good measure!

Arms began to grab me, but it was not demons that restrained me then. Men of the village, pulling me away from the demonic horde. Traitors! Soft-bellied cowards, throwing your lot in with Evil! I swung my lance wildly, trying to free myself from their grasp! Got a few right on the head, crimson coloring the air. A just reward for those who pact with the Darkness!

Other traitors came, wearing the blue of a realm knight. They, too, had surrendered to the horde's sway? The knights came at me, my lance was taken. I fought valiantly, kicked and bit, but no avail. 

They took me to a demon then, black with white spots on it's hide, and glaring red eyes atop it's head. Shoved into it's maw, sealed in the creatures belly. But no matter my struggle or screams there was no escape. I watched the knights climb (willingly! How far they must have fallen!) into the beast's maw, as it roared it's demonic speech and began running. 

I knew not which cultist abode they were taking me, but I fell silent as we rode. Best to bide my time. Resume the attack once I could appraise their numbers.

I am a Sister of the Order. I will not go down without a fight.
