I had tried working out. I had tried dieting, I had tried pills, and so many other things and in the end, I could never get the body I wanted. Sure, I got "better", in that I wasn't morbidly obese, and sure, I had friends and family assure me that I looked "okay" and "better" and that "what matters is that you're healthy". And I was very healthy. I walked a lot, I had slightly low blood pressure instead of high (a very important variable for the study). Nobody had asked me out on a date in the past 10 years (and I'm only counting that one because it was valentine's day of grade 7), but between the insulating fat, the low blood pressure, the high IQ, knowing five languages, and being able to hike a few miles without issue, I was a prime candidate for the experiment. Not having abs or defined muscle tone wasn't an issue.

Of course I agreed. I didn't exactly have quite the life. If all went according to plan, I would wake up in a new century as a living time capsule. If it didn't... I wouldn't need antidepressants anymore. 

Everything looked different when I woke up. The capsule opened, as it was supposed to. I was disoriented for the first few minutes, but as the various drugs finished waking me up, I noticed the foggy grey of the sky, and the bright redness of the sun. At noon. 

"The fuck?" I muttered, and climbed out. The capsule had opened automatically, and there was nobody there to greet me. Nor anybody just... Hanging out at the facility. I walked around in the white scrubs I had been given for a while until I noticed some hikers. 

"Hey! Hey, the research centre is empty, did something happen?" 

The two men stared at me mesmerized. They were clearly disfigured by something, one had one arm far smaller than the other, both of their jaws looked infested by tumours, and they were both using strange robotic crutches to walk. 

They stared at me, their mouths open, their eyes filled with fear and awe and lust and all these weird emotions at once that I can't remember ever eliciting. My head swiveled for a moment, but there was nothing right behind me. 

"Hey? Guys? How long have I been out?" 

The one with the disfigured arm fainted. The other continued to stare.

"Um... Alo?" He squeaked at me.

"Hello, yes? Research centre? Over there? Empty? What year is it?" 

"It-it-it-it--" he babbled and stuttered for a moment. 

"Dude, chill," I said, putting my hand on his shoulder. He passed out too. 

With no other immediate source of information, I sat on the ground cross-legged and waited until the one with the shrunken arm woke up. 

"Hello. My name is Ana. I just woke up from a cryogenic chamber. What year is it?" 

"Twenty-two fourteen." 

"Okay. That's good. For a moment I wondered if you guys spoke intelligible English."

"What are you?" 

"Um... I just said--" 

"No cryogenic chamber could have survived the wars. Everything was destroyed. And... And you're so beautiful..."

He extended his small arm towards me. It was a little creepy but I did my best not to pay attention to that, because I didn't want to be ableist and also because if I reacted poorly he might collapse again. 

"...Right... Anyway, is there like, a nearby town?" 

"Yes. Yes of course. We can take you there." 

He touched his friend's neck, and in a moment he woke up. 

"Why did you not wake us earlier, um... Ana?" He asked me as his friend rubbed his eyes. 

"I thought you weren't supposed to try to wake up people who had passed out," I said. 

"A simple stimulation of the vagus nerve and the six-two-four points in the Lasega map do it." 

"...'kaaay." I said with a nod. He alternated between staring at the ground and staring at me. 

"So, you have a name?" I asked. 

"Yes. Yes, I am Laeroeak." 

"Leroek?" 

"Laeroeak." 

"Laroak?" 

He repeated his name some four times, and we settled on me calling him "Lay". 

"I am sorry I fainted." His friend said. "I could not handle your touch." 

I frowned, and he stared. The staring was becoming a problem. 

"Your hands are so soft..." 

"Can we get back to the part where I get to a town or something?" 

"Yes, of course! Everyone must see you!" 

"And your name?" 

"Ghantenebhurita." 

I rubbed my temples. We settled on Ghan. After some walking, they became perplexed. 

"You are not tired." 

"...That was like... Two hundred metres." I said. 

"We came with camping gear, but you... How are you not tired? Is your acetylcholine synthesis infinite? Do you have superior lactic acid? Are your muscle fibres made of carbon nanotubes?" 

"What the fuck? No, I'm just walking! Is everyone in the future like this?" 

We stopped as a small river hindered our path. I jumped onto a rock, then from the rock across to the other side. They watched in awe. 

"What are you?" 

"...How did you guys make it before...?"

"Biodegradable preprogrammed assemblybots." 

Ley had his robot-assisted arm fetch a ball from his pocket, and threw it in the river. Within seconds a bridge appeared, and they crossed it.

"Nice." 

"You like it?" He asked with a smile. "I changed the design to resemble old bridges, Ana of the Past." 

I frowned. "...How? You... You literally just threw it in." 

"I programmed it before." 

"Before coming, you mean." 

"No, as I got it from my bag." 

My eyes grew, but I simply nodded. 

Even with their robotic crutch aid, they got tired by the second km, and I had to wait for them. 

"I am literally just coming out of cryostasis. I have not eaten in two hundred years. How are you the tired ones?" I didn't tell them about the adrenaline shots I'd gotten to wake up, but... Still. Ghan looked at me in admiration. 

"How are you still breathing?" He asked between gasps. 

"We're walking at the pace of grandmas, how would I not?" 

By the time we arrived at the nearby town, there was a crowd waiting with food and water and curious eyes. Apparently, Ley had taken the liberty of thinking at them to do that. 

Everyone stared at me like I was Aphrodite incarnate.
