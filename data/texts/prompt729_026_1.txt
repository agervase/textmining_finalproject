From the first night I was born I have known of my place I  the universe, my miniscule, insignificant place. I know more than most men could dream of knowing, and am superior In knowledge to all, past present or future. But have no capacity for engenuity of my own. Stuck to slave over the books of other's accomplishments loathing my own inadequacy.

I need not more knowledge! I crave the one thing I can learn from books or manuscripts, I crave... creativity. My waking moments are haunted by people of an inferior physce, looking upon me with aw as if I am some sort of miracle or protégé. I am nothing of the sort! I'm a failure! 

I now wish I had never been born, this "celebration" of my birth is a disgrace. Not a single enjoyment left that I have not exhausted to boredom through the authors of any of the countless books I have read.

What does it all matter anyway, even a single generation down few will remember me, life is fleeting and existence is pain. I can not force myself to conceive children or even find a suitable mate, knowing exactly what is likely to happen to them. Mundane job, average intelligence, crippling debt. It's all so unfair. 

Why should others have so much creativity while I'm left being the creativity equivalent of deep space! I know what I must do. If I can't have it, no one can. I shall use my knowledge to create a weapon, surpassing nuclear bombs even. I've got it... Super massive antimatter generator capable of generating enough antimatter to take a very sizable chunk out of the crust. But that's only the primary effect. The real damage comes when the massive amount of gamma radiation generated by the collision will kill almost all life on earth, anyone left alive will be an irradiated wreck with no food or safe water. Finally I can be at peace...






Thanks for the read! Hope you enjoyed! Sorry if I made any mistakes
