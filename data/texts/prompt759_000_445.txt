Lazarus tried the church doors. They were locked.

He sat down on the sidewalk and huddled in his rags.

People passed. Time passed. Seconds and minutes were nothing to Lazarus. He waited. Waiting was what he'd become best at.

The priest came out of the front doors sometime that evening. He saw Lazarus sitting on the sidewalk near the steps.

"Can I help you, sir?"

"I'm just looking for shelter," said Lazarus. "I'm very tired and I need a place to sleep."

"Of course," said the priest. "There's a homeless shelter on 4th. I can take you there if you like."

"I need to get inside the church," said Lazarus. "I need to talk to Christ. I tried earlier but the doors were locked. It's of great sadness to me that even God's house has to lock its doors in this day and age."

"You don't need to be in a church to talk to Christ," said the priest. "Would you like me to pray with you?"

"I'm afraid I must insist," said Lazarus. "I must look upon His image and speak with him."

"God and His Son are all around us at all times," said the priest. "You can tell him whatever you like wherever you are."

"I understand," said Lazarus patiently. "But I really must speak with an image of Him. It makes it so much easier. I need to see if I am allowed to rest yet."

"Rest?" the priest asked, puzzled.

"Five minutes of your time," said Lazarus. 

The priest was in a bit of a hurry, but he was a kind young man and he could spare more than five minutes for this fellow, who looked to be more than down on his luck.

"Of course," he said. Out came his keys and into the church lobby the two of them strolled.

"Where are you from?" the priest asked the homeless man as they made for the chapel, the scent of cedar and incense invading their nostrils. "You don't sound like you're from around here, if you don't mind me saying so."

Lazarus looked at the young priest. His eyes held eons.

"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."
