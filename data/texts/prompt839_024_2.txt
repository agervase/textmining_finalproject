So... you never experianced the 3 move checkmate?

No, no one is dumb enough to try it when their life depends on it.,,

So what do we do now? I mean do I go back to my body or do I get a new one, the whole reincarnation thing... I mean I'm cool with what ever but honestly death is really fucking scary to me and I would like to avoid it if possible.

Ya it's scary to everyone. This chess game is just here to make people accept it. Honestly no one has ever won before. This isn't how it is supposed to happen. It's supposed to be an epic confrontation with the person excepting their own mortality or what not, but you just... you just kind of won...

Well that sucks! So I would like to go back now... Am I buried?

ya...

How does this work again?

I don't know... I guess you go back to your body...

But that is in the ground.

Ya I guess it is....

So... what is the alternative?

Well the afterlife actually depends on a culmination of culture and believes combined to create what you believe the after life to be like. The process is all really complicated but I guess you also get the option of living in a casket until you choose to give up or dig out. your choice.

 I guess heaven, I guess heaven would be like perfection right?

Well for most people it is but your had a Masochist thing going for your entire life so your afterlife is a bit more like most people's hell. With all the stabbing and shit. So... Maybe go back to Earth?

Oh shit, that was a mistake I guess I mean how bad could it be?

Well I have your paper here and it's pretty bad... Something about sodomizing your Anus with the entire body of a blue whale for all eternity. 

And the alternative is spending a ton of time clawing through the wood casket with nothing but my figure nails right?

Ya...

I should have had a better idea of the afterlife...

Ya probably.
