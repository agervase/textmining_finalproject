FADE IN:

INT. A CORPORATE BOARDROOM – DAY

*Several men and women in suits sit around a large table, all of them looking bored. At the front of the room, a man with a white beard flicks at the black eyepatch that he wears. This is ODIN.*

**ODIN:** You know, I was supposed to get the wisdom of the ages.

*Halfhearted murmurs are offered by everyone at the table.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) There I was, thinking I'd be granted some kind of sublime knowledge. Do you know what I got?

*A blond-haired man with a neatly trimmed beard sighs. This is THOR.*

**THOR:** A bunch of old wives' tales and some herbal remedies?    
**ODIN:** A bunch of old... hey!    
**THOR:** And when you asked for a refund, Mimir told you to...

*A breathtakingly beautiful woman – SIF – interrupts.*

**SIF:** (*Interrupting*) He told you to go sit on a glacier.    
**ODIN:** Now, look, if you people are just going to...

*A sudden flash of light interrupts Odin. When the room's illumination returns to normal, a very confused young man is revealed. This is DAVE. He is clad in a pink apron and is clutching a black spatula.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) ... huh. That hasn't happened in a while.    
**DAVE:** Yeah, I'm reasonably certain that pancakes aren't normally supposed to do that.    
**SIF:** Do what?    
**DAVE:** I'm not sure. What just happened?

*A middle-aged woman grins with glee. This is HEL.*

**HEL:** You died!    
**DAVE:** I think I'd remember that.    
**THOR:** No, that's definitely what happened.

*Dave glances around.*

**DAVE:** Heaven looks really boring.    
**THOR:** This is Valhalla.    
**DAVE:** Valhalla looks really boring. Why am I in Valhalla?    
**ODIN:** Good question. Only warriors who die in battle are supposed to come here.    
**DAVE:** You must get a lot of soldiers, then.    
**SIF:** Actually, no, we don't. See, you *don't* have to die in battle; you have to die holding a weapon.    
**DAVE:** Soldiers carry guns! Guns are weapons!    
**HEL:** Not according to Section Nine, Paragraph Four of the Valhalla Bylaws!

*Everyone in the room save for Dave and Hel groans with impatience.*

**DAVE:** The what?    
**THOR:** Don't encourage her.    
**HEL:** According to our charter, a weapon is an object which renders injury or death.    
**DAVE:** ... So, a gun?    
**HEL:** No, a bullet.    
**DAVE:** That seems like a remarkably stupid technicality.    
**THOR:** *You're* a remarkably stupid technicality!    
**ODIN:** He might be, actually.

*All eyes in the room turn to face Odin.*    

**SIF:** Huh?    
**ODIN:** Well, what's that in his hand?    
**DAVE:** It's a spatula.    
**ODIN:** I know it's a spatula... but what *is* it?    
**THOR:** ... A spatula.    
**ODIN:** You're not getting it. What *is* a spatula?    

*A sudden thought seems to occur to Dave.*

**DAVE:** Hang on! Why does Valhalla look like an office building?    
**HEL:** We had to redefine a pen as weapon a few decades ago.    
**DAVE:** Because it's mightier than the sword?    
**HEL:** Because a disgruntled accountant stabbed his coworker with one.    
**DAVE:** Oh. I take it he lost that fight.    
**THOR:** He...    
**DAVE:** (*Interrupting*) Since he died, I mean.    
**THOR:** He actually slipped and hit his head while running away.    
**SIF:** He wouldn't stop screaming, so we redesigned Valhalla to make him calm down.    
**DAVE:** And... what? You just kept it this way?    
**HEL:** (*Shrugging*) Eh.

*Odin slams his fist on the table.*

**ODIN:** Enough! I swear, you people will drone on about the dullest things!    
**THOR:** (*Muttering*) You mean like trading your eye for a chicken soup recipe?    
**ODIN:** Now, for the last time: What is a spatula?

*Several seconds of silence pass.*

**THOR:** It's...    
**ODIN:** (*Interrupting*) Don't say "a spatula."    
**THOR:** Well, it is.    
**SIF:** You mean... are you asking if it counts as a weapon?    
**ODIN:** Finally! Yes.    
**THOR:** You could have been direct about it.     
**ODIN:** (*In a mocking voice*) "You could have been direct about it." Shut up.    
**THOR:** You're an ass.    
**HEL:** I think it counts as a weapon.    
**SIF:** Odin's ass?    
**THOR:** Only after taco night.    
**HEL:** *The spatula!*   
**SIF:** Is it forged from celestial iron or something?

*Dave examines his spatula.*

**DAVE:** No, I think it's just plastic.    
**HEL:** It counts! It can render injury or death!    
**DAVE:** Hey, my pancakes aren't *that* bad!    
**HEL:** We are not concerned with your pancakes; we're talking about the spatula.    
**SIF:** Do you ever say a word so often that it starts to sound funny?    
**THOR:** Spa-tu-la.    
**ODIN:** Spa-tuuuuu-la.    
**SIF:** Spaaaaa-tu-la.    
**DAVE:** (*Shouting*) Confused! *Confused!*

*Dave closes his eyes and starts waving his spatula in front of him. It smacks on the top of Odin's head several times.*

**ODIN:** Ow! Ow! Stop it! Stop it! Ow!    
**HEL:** There! See?! That's an injury!

*Dave stops flailing and opens one eye.*

**DAVE:** Oh, god, sorry, I...    
**THOR:** (*Interrupting*) Odin.    
**DAVE:** What?    
**ODIN:** What?    
**THOR:** No, not... ugh. He said "god." That's the other guy.    
**SIF:** Technically, it's an unspecified deity. You're thinking of Jehovah.    
**HEL:** It's "Yeshua" now.    
**THOR:** No, that's his son. We go drinking on Tuesdays.    
**ODIN:** When *don't* you go drinking? Lazy layabout.

*Thor snatches the spatula from Dave and brandishes it at Odin.*

**THOR:** You want to go, old man? Huh?    
**SIF:** (*To Hel*) Huh, look at that. I guess you're right.    
**HEL:** That settles it. The spatula is a weapon.

*Odin snatches the spatula from Thor and whacks him over the head with it.*

**ODIN:** Any more like that out of you, and you're grounded!    

*Thor sits back and sulks. Odin turns the spatula over in his hands a few times.*

**ODIN:** (*CONT'D*) I mean... I guess. Sure, why not? It's better than that stupid pen.    
**HEL:** That was plastic, too, by the way.

*Odin hands the spatula back to Dave, who looks uncertain.*

**DAVE:** So, uh... does that mean I'm staying?    
**HEL:** It looks that way.    
**SIF:** Yeah, welcome to Valhalla, I guess.    
**DAVE:** Great. Now that everything is cleared up, I just have one question.    
**THOR:** The bathroom is down the hall.    
**DAVE:** Huh? Oh, no, thanks, but I was actually curious about something else.    
**ODIN:** What troubles you, warrior?

*Dave takes a deep breath.*

**DAVE:** How the hell did I even die?!

*Hel takes out her smartphone and scrolls through something.*

**HEL:** It looks like the batter mix you used was contaminated... with cyanide.    
**DAVE:** ... That seems incredibly unlikely.    
**HEL:** Well, that's what happened.    
**THOR:** I guess your pancakes *were* that bad!

*Dave stares at Thor for a moment, then whacks him with the spatula.*

CUT TO BLACK.
