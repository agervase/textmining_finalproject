Every month, I've slowly been accumulating knowledge over my soulmate, ever since my third vision, I've wrote down the most valuable information each vision I've gotten.

*She has a friend named Luke, and a cousin called "BB" (nickname?)

*She's in a football team, her uniform is green. 

*Her name is Rachael, she gets good grades, 9/10. (Does not write surname on exams, wonder why?)

*She either lives in Italy or is visiting! 

*She has a little brother? Definitely a younger family member of some sort.

*She's crying.

*She was reading a book.

*She has scars on her left wrist.

*She's reading a book, nothing interesting here...

*Quite frankly I'd rather forget this one, she has a boyfriend. 

*New scars, she was showering, scars on her legs too...

*She's in the cinema, watching a movie.

*She's looking in the mirror! She's beautiful. I've never seen a more perfect girl in my life. She's brunnete, gorgeous blue eyes, tanned, red lipstick, dressed stunningly, definitely going for a night out. I won't forget that face, ever.

*She's looking over the edge of a cliff. Enjoying views? It's peaceful, no sight of other life, I wonder what's on her mind...

*She's laying in her bed.

*She was writing a song, I feel like this lyric was about me "He looked at the ocean with tears in his eyes, he can't find his soulmate he-", I didn't get to read anymore. That has to definitely be about me. 

*SHE'S CALLING A PHONE NUMBER. I HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH! I have all of the digits except the last too. I'm going to call each possible number until I can find someone who's contacted her! I'm so close to finding out who she is!

*My vision is overdue. 

A month after I wrote that, I realized what happened. They say if you go three months without a vision, something bad has happened, I already know, the number she called, a suicide hotline. It's obvious she took her own life. I think about Rachael every day. 

I managed to contact her family around a month afterwards. I cancelled my trip around Europe, the mere mention of Italy made my heart sink.

I found it difficult to carry on with life after talking with her parents. She was troubled, moved around too much as a kid. Socially awkward. I never got that impression off the visions. I wonder what she had thought of me... I certainly thought of her differently than her parents did.

I didn't date until age 23. By then I had already accepted fate, and that maybe being with someone, even if there's the possibility they won't truly love you for you, is okay. I met this lovely blonde girl, with beautiful blue eyes, on the beach, after getting to know each other, we had similar experiences, stories. She didn't have a soulmate either. Yet, here we are, happy as can be, going through our old diaries and books from when I was your age, so it's okay if you don't have visions, you don't need them.

"So, umm, hey dad... Umm why am I named after your soulmate?" Because Rachael, supposedly, there is no one you love more then your soulmate. And honestly, you know that there is no one I love more than you... 

She hugged me tight. Never have I felt happier.
