The house was quiet, no lights on inside that I could see. This guy had been a real piece of work in his first life, and rather savvy as far as our techniques went. Per the last report, his body was in a state of pretty extreme decomp, so Berk and I had decided not to call for backup, we could probably handle him ourselves.

I nodded to Berk, and we both got out of the squad car simultaneously. It was nighttime, and we had turned the headlamps off so none of the neighbors could tip him off. We drew our service weapons, moving to either side of the door. I silently mouthed *one, two, three* to Berk, and he swiveled in front of the door to kick it down.

It was a pretty sorry scene. Getty was kneeling in the middle of the den, oozing god-knows-what everywhere, but the house was bare. No furnishings, nothing hung on the walls, nothing. Whoever lived here, they'd up and left a long time ago. Getty was totally silent except for the occasional sniff. I could have screamed at him for all the things he'd done in his first life, but it didn't feel appropriate.

"You know why we're here, don't you?"

Getty didn't even turn to me, just nodded slowly. "They're gone. They're all gone." It was all he would say. I nodded to Berk to cuff him so we could bring him in.

"I'm going back to the squad car to cover the backseat with some plastic so he doesn't drip everywhere," I joked, and Berk just smiled. I had barely crossed the threshold when the screaming started. I turned on my heel to see Getty ripping into Berk's neck. He was fast. Faster than he should have been. Before I knew it, he was on me, too. I went for my service weapon, but it was too late. I'd let my guard down.

And Getty was gonna eat me.
