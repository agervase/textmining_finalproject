The mouse in Boots fled across the basement, and the kitty cat followed. There had been other basements, even other cats, but this one was different.  It did not skulk and slink like so many others. Instead, the half-grown kit stood proud atop a stack of boxes and yowled out its challenge n the Old Tongue. Any one of his dozens of Brothers and sisters would have run in terror before he was half done, even without knowing what it meant. Any one of my brothers and sisters would have escaped my fate.  


I chittered back my response, sheathed my sword, and began to run. I juked, I served, I ran like no mouse before me, but each time I looked over at the pillar, he was still there, locking himself or grooming his ears. Then, at last, I saw it. There was a half-height refrigerator in the far corner of the basement, and a full slice of American awaited me on the floor before it. The square was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen, a full tail length on a side, and just waiting for me. I debated between eating it and caring it home, but my family would not believe if they didn't see it for themselves.  I rolled the cheese up into a sort of Bell shape and was turning to leave when I felt a single prick on the back of my neck. Shit.

The Little mouse was so predictable, not even bothering to take a long route. It was simple enough to get behind him and tap him lightly with one class, not even disturbing his silly little hat. The creature whirled on me and stabbed me in the front paw. I hissed in anger and pain "Lawbreaker!" before batting him into the wall with one velveted paw. He flew and feel, dazed as I least for him, landing a little off on account of stabbing.  I was reaching for the moose to take a trumpet bite when I felt the hand of Foodbringer grab me and the mouse as well. He gave me a scratch, and I thanked him for it. Of course, I then jumped down, ran up the stairs and shedded everywhere.

I felt safe for a moment and relaxed. The human shook his head sadly. "If you wanted a fight to the death, you shouldn't have waited for Kitty to count coup on you." he opined, ass he took up some dowels and a stapler. "But even a dishonorable mouse can send a message."

Pixie had told me where they were getting into the property, so I took Squeak and the frame down to the little path. Fun fact: nice can scream. Little guy was a long time dying, but none of its cousins ever crossed my gate again.
