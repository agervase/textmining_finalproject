My sons been a moody little shit for a while now.

Sitting in his room, sulking.

I’m so...frustrated at him. 

I get that he’s at this adolescent stage now... I just never thought he’d be this bad.

Me and him...we used to be a team. Going everywhere together. There would be ice cream at the skatepark, or sitting on the pier watching the sun set.

It’s been hard for me. I couldn’t do it alone...and I think he hates me for that. He hates that I was too weak to keep that up...


I’m so disappointed though. It’s hard managing with one arsehole, so now my sons become one too?

I don’t know where I’ve went wrong and I think it might be too late to make it up to him...

...after all I’ve tried to do for us. For him...

He should be thanking me and...

**BANG**

Oh...shit! Daryl’s home.

I haven’t even started dinner yet!

Daryl is going to...fuck!

Daryl

“Oh, honey. Sorry I’ll get on to dinner, okay. You just relax on the couch, I’ll go grab you a beer...”

Shit shit shit shit

What’s in the freezer?

Fuck! Microwave lasagne? Sausages?

Fuck. We have some cans.

Maybe I can quickly go pick up some takeaways...

“Here you go baby. And uh...can I borrow some money? I’ll go pick up some Chinese for you. You love Chinese”

Fuck fuck fuck!

His damn hands are trembling...

Make it quick. It won’t hurt as bad if I make it quick. Do it quick

“...baby..I was so lazy today. I just sat and did nothing while you wor-“

Gurgh!

Ugh...god. Fuck. I can’t breathe.

Shit, he’s shaking again

“B-b-bab-by...”

Fuck. Am I crying? Be strong. You can do this

“...I know I deserve it...I j-j-j... d-d-do ittt”

Please just do it. Please just do it

...

He’s still shaking...

He’s really going to hurt me...

“D-d-daryl...please, let it go. D-d-do it”

Please don’t hurt me. Please.

I can’t watch. I can’t even open my eyes

I don’t want to die...

“All I remember next is a sound, like a bomb going off....I felt warm liquid wash over me...and bits of wood got stuck into my skin...”

“That was bone. The impact caused the whole body to break down and explode out...”

“I didn’t even see him...my son. I d-d-didn’t...”

“That’s okay Mrs. Farier. Would you like a tissue.... Okay. So...where did he go...your son.”

“I don’t know. I just...i was in shock.”

“You said that he hit you after hitting Mr. Campbell. That he’s the one who gave you the bruises”

“...yes. He..he hit me and I couldn’t get up and see..and he ran. I didn’t see...I’m sorry.”

“Of course, Mrs. Farier. Don’t worry, we’re not questioning that at all...”

“Now...Mrs. Farier. We believe you, totally. We just wanted to discuss the will that Mr. Daryl Campbell left. It seems you were the sole beneficiary prior to his death...”

“Under the circumstances that you or your son would’ve committed violence against Mr. Campbell, you would be ineligible for inheriting Mr. Campbell’s significant wealth and his family’s business”

“Of course, it didn’t happen this way. As you and some of his family have stated, your son, -his step son- , had began to assault you and threaten Mr. Daryl...”

“We only wanted...well....”

“We wanted to wish you well, Mrs. Farier. And to let you know that we are confident in your witness statement and will pass on our findings to Mr. Campbell’s family lawyer and their insurance representatives”

“We will continue to keep an eye out for your son. And if you feel in ANY danger whatsoever, call this numb......”
