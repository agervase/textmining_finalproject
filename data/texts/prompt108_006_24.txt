I fled here from my home country, after murdering a stranger. No reasons, no motives, he just looked at me funny. Back there I would be called delusional, a psychopath. Here, I am known as a valuable asset. There is one problem though.  It's only been three days since I joined these terrorists, and I already begin to hold my doubts. In the day, nobody walks anywhere near each other, staring at each other with shifty eyes. I feel that if someone were to cough, the trenches would erupt into fighting. At night, I hear my fellow members talk in hushed whispers, with their faces against the collars.

All these pieces of the puzzle make me wonder if there is a larger plot at hand, it makes me wonder if these people are even dedicated to the cause, or, like myself, want an excuse to kill. What if these people were all part of one large conspiracy to get me to confess to my murders, and their distrust were small signals to one another about my actions? No, it is merely paranoia. The government wouldn't dedicate this many resources to capture one man, but it still begs the question: what are these people doing, and who are they? The group consists of people from many different ethnic groups, however, I studied the bible that these terrorists go by, as not to be outcast, and it demands a single race, preaching that all others are inferior. There is definitely something larger at hand here. Tonight, my knife will taste blood. I will kill one who speaks to their collar. I will get to the bottom of this. I don't care if this entire trench explodes in combat against one another in the morning. 

I'll be long gone before anyone realises this death.
