"I remember a time when paintball was reserved for drunken stag parties and corporate bonding days, before the great recession of 2022."

"Yeah Grandad, you've told me before" - with a roll of the eyes... Good thing he'll be on my team I think to myself.

"Well, now it's the national game! Even became an Olympic event in the 2030's! Everyone had to work harder to get us back on our feet. Video games were disbanded... Everyone ploughed themselves into growing their own veg to keep the family fed or for trade. Working hard to build up the economy. Physical activities became the norm so everyone could blow off steam. No time to waste on frivulous computers."

"Look Grandad, it's starting, better pay attention" - That's me told, little shit. Too much like his damn father but I bite my lip and keep quiet. He'll appreciate me one day, probably when I'm gone.

The attendant is running through the rules, but we all know them. I played twice times a week until I was in my 40's. Though something catches my eye, one guy in the opposite team is wearing his own fatigues (not entirely uncommon, I have my own somewhere though theyre a bit tight fitting now) and on his chest is a name I recognise. A name that's haunted me for years...

It's him... I can't quite believe it. What are the chances?! And he's still using the same moniker, what a colossal asshole. I can hear him talking to the other players, that nasal voice. It's HIM!!!!
After all these years I'll have my chance for revenge. I still remember how he escaped, ran off when he knew he was beaten. Utter Coward... but this time I'M going to have the last word!

The teams seperate off into the battleground, and with the great roar of the klaxon we're off! My grandson runs straight off, abondoning the old "dead weight" that I clearly am... Good, I'll be better off without him to give me away. My enemy is a good 10 years younger than me, I'll need to be quiet to get the upper hand.

I prowl round the outside of the battleground, slowly moving deeper into enemy territory. I remember his style... He'll be camped up at the back with a good view of the middle ground. I've played here before and know the perfect spot, the bushes on the hilltop to the south.

It takes me a while but I loop round, right enough I can see his legs sticking out of the bush. He's set up in the snipers nest. Slowly now I inch forward until I'm about 10 feet from him.

***SNAP*** 

I look down at my foot and there's a branch under my boot. "SHIT!" - I hear him cry, the bushes rustling as he tries to prise the paintball gun from under him.

**PHUT PHUT PHUT**

I fire the three shots off, each one hitting its target, torso and arms.

"What the *FUCK* dude?!" he cries. Inside I'm screaming with joy!!!! Now's my chance!

"Fucked my mother did you xX360noscopegangstaXx?! Well, now I've fucked you! HAHAHAHA"

God I miss my PS4.
