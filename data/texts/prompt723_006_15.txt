...There were catz, lots of catz...

But why? To what purpose? The apex predators clearly worshipped these non-sentient lifeforms. Throughout their recorded history, from early 'hieroglyphics' {a proto-language made up of pictorial semiotical phonemes} to end of days 'memes' {a meta-language made up of pictorial semiotical phonemes} this apex species (homo-sapiens, humans, or people) deferred extraordinary importance to the actions of these catz.

It's easy to assume that these catz exercised an outsized influence on the well-being of the homo sapiens -but this does not seem to be the case. The catz did not control weather, or confer blessings, or predict the future. It appears the catz were simply domesticated, mammalian, quadrupeds with no apparent language, culture, or value outside of sporadic vermin control. 

Rather, it seems these catz were a vessel into which the people poured their existence as they vainly searched for meaning in their infinitely finite lives: 

If you needed safe passage down the 'Nile' {a flowing body of water} you would invoke the poise of a cat. If you were lost in 'Wonderland' {a drug-induced hallucinatory state} you would call upon the 'Cheshire' cat for direction. If you were on a 'Hot Tin Roof' {a corrugated metal covering of a domicile} you would reenact repressed sexual desire to cultivate your cat'z appreciation of the Southern Gothic literary tradition. If you wanted a 'Cheezburger,' {definition unclear} you would haz it. 

In truth, these catz were not feral beasts: domesticated and trained to hunt rodents. These catz represented the human spirit as it strove to overcome its primal instincts, to elevate its current condition, and to build itself towards a bold and glorious future...

Which is why it's fascinating (and more than a little ironic) that these homo sapiens were undone by the very beings they exalted. 

Bio-index and socio-genealogical examinations indicate that a cat-borne parasite {'toxoplasmosis gondii' was its people name} could infect human brains and alter their behavior. The humans were aware of this, but continued to co-habitat with catz for purposes of companionship, self-importance, and meme-creation. 

However in the summer of 2018, a contaminated batch of 'cat food' {food for catz} caused this parasite to undergo radical genetic mutation. The resulting infection of the humans caused them to go 'ape shit' {definition unclear} and launch their primitive atomic-radiation weapons at other parts of the planet, which lead to an atomic winter that destroyed 95% of the genetic life on this world. 

Happily, numerous species did survive, which will provide us with invaluable data into carbon-based life forms. These species include cockroaches {insect}, mosquitos {insects}, penguins {feathered insect/undetermined}, rabbits {mammalian}, dipping dots {fungus/undetermined} and -incredibly- a living specimen of the catz species {mammalian}. 

It appears that a cat was placed inside a box with a radioactive isotope which might or might not unleash a deadly poison. And while the mental exercise behind this contraption was ultimately facile and somewhat ironic, it did create the conditions to preserve the cat specimen in suspended animation for thousands of millennia.*

*Unfortunately the cat appears to be 'grumpy'{unpleased} and keeps scowling at us.
