Baby jail was a truly frightening place. No matter how many times you saw it, watching infants act like hardened criminals is hard to process.

It was truly amazing the effect of the Park Ji Soo discovery had on the world. Making regression memories cheap, available, and permanent changed how people viewed death. No longer would we be ripped from our families upon death. At least, not for too long. Time was viewed very differently nowadays. Most people get their regression memories added around their high school graduation, although earlier wasn't uncommon. Famously, the youngest child ever to receive her past life memories was a mere 5 years old. This was laughably false to someone in my industry, but widely believed among the public.

'Bounty Hunter' is the title most of the country refers to me as, but I feel like it's a misnomer. I prefer to think of myself as a regression investigator. Helps me get through the day I guess. Hospitals always had regression done on newborns, and now that home births were made illegal, we get to know where everyone comes from and what they've done. In almost all cases these memories are never seen by the infant, and in most cases where the infant is given the memories of their past lives, it is only for an hour or two before my (and my peers) investigations are complete, and the infant is deemed innocent. However, in the rare case of felonious suicide, I intervene. These are the ones sent to baby jail. 

Those that tried to use suicide as a way to get out of their debts or escape from their crimes are my responsibility. Everyone was under the impression that regression was something voluntary during adolescence, but that was far from the truth. Every child in every hospital was tested, and it gave me a sick sense of righteousness to see the guilty being carted off.
