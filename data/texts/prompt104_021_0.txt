“Pick it up.”

I heard a voice that sounded as if it came from the middle of nowhere, my head quickly turning as I realized that... right. It was 1 in the morning and that I was alone out here. Like I always was. Isolated.

The voice spoke to me again. “Hey, dumbass. Pick it up!”

Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm. What the hell did that mean, anyways? Pick it up? I looked to the ground, not seeing a thing around except... oh, nice. A penny. My uncle picked up every single one he’d find off the ground and got me into the habit of doing the same. Because he got rich off a penny one day. Picked up a 1943 copper and sold it for $70,000. 

So, hey... implying that there wasn’t anything else on the sidewalk except dirt and a cap off a plastic water bottle, I picked the coin up.

My face was on it.

I just stared back to it... I didn’t even look any older than I did now. It almost looked as if it was my exact face that I made right before picking it up, and the one thing that really put me off was that it was dated 26 years in the future.

2044. 

I heard a faint sound of laughter as I saw the shadow of a figure walk off in the distance.

And were those elf ears? They couldn’t be.

I stared back to them as I began to run off, following the figure that was slowly moving away. I’d had enough of these dreams... until I was awoken, my eyes peering open back to my bedroom. 6 AM. My alarm was going off.

And the same Ed Sheeran song was playing on the radio.

I’ve had enough of these “dreams”.
