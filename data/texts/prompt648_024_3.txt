Hammer in hand, he plowed the final nail into the final board. And with that, his shrine was finished.

Months of blood, sweat, and tears went into this simple demonstration of his belief in the call of the universe. He felt it in his bones; as real as the sun and the wind and the gift of life's essence, his deity would acklowledge his faith with favor.

And all it took was this small shrine; simple wood and nails intertwined into an object representing the intertwining worlds of physical and spiritual. It was his, and it was his god's.

So he retreated to his simple home. Small and unadorned, all he had had been dedicated to his faith. Yet he was content with his work. Pleased, in fact. So he slept.

The following day he visited his shrine, his source of honor. There was nothing of change. No sign of something greater, no sign that his faith was to be rewarded. "Today must not be the day, but I know my faith will be rewarded with a sign." Like the day before he returned home and knew his sign would come.

Days turned into months, months into years. Each day the man remained steadfast in his faith, examined the shrine, and found no sign of his god.

Eventually, late in his life, the man fell ill. He shuffled to his shrine, now a rotting shamble of wood and nails intertwined into an object representing the intertwining worlds of physical and spiritual. It was his, and it was his god's.

Today was the day. His god would meet him here.

He sat. And sat. And he drew his last breath. In that last draw of life, he wondered if his life had been wasted. He wondered if his god would meet him in the other side. He hoped.

And then he was no more.
