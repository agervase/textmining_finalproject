It was maddening. *Infuriating.* How could you possibly see that coming? Weeks of setting an elaborate trap, involving plotting every escape route down to the weak bricks in the fucking wall, men hidden in every crack, crevice and cavity you could find. It was the perfect setup. Have him come in for the great diamond, exactly 03:16 *sharp*, wait for him to take it, have wherever he came from blocked off, and have men surround him from every angle. It was the stuff detective movie dreams were made of, what children playing cops and robbers with their legos imagine they're going to foil with their scheming intellect, but *nooooo!*

This, this... ***buffoon*** walks straight through the front fucking door *at* ***fucking midnight***, slaps the glass cover away like my precious little kitten does when her favourite toy is dangled above her, grabs the diamond with his disgusting sausage fingers, and fucks off. All in the span of five fucking minutes. There are no words to describe how utterly livid I am in this moment. But it's fine. Oh, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine.

*It's not fine at all!* I can't predict this fool! He has no motivations, no reason, no rhyme! I'd prefer tracking a deranged serial killer obsessed with the number four that leaves utterly gruesome crime scenes behind, for God's sake! Last week, this halfwit was robbing a McDonald's, the week before that he was stealing glue sticks from a primary school, and now he's only gone and robbed a diamond worth a thousand times more than the McDonald's he stole from! 

I slammed my diary into the desk, pen whirling away into some distant corner. I'd get it later. Standing up quickly and turning on my heel, I grit my teeth and stormed out the door, turning too fast to greet the dull, grey sky out the adjacent window with my utterly sour expression as I strode down the corridor, barely paying attention to the dull, generic surroundings. Staring down the mugshot of the ugly toupee'd mug, hatred threatening to boil over more and more every millisecond longer that I spent staring at his inattentive face. I snarled through my clenched teeth, crumpling the photo in my hands. I have single-handedly found out more serial killers than I could count, global thieves that had stolen millions in goods, terrorists living in a hole in a field, for God's sake. This *uneducated muppet* will not evade me again.
