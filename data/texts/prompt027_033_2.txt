After a week of debauchery, and sin using the time-freeze to my advantage, I experienced all forms of pleasures a man can experience I had my way with possibly all the women in my entire town if I could give an accurate count, all the women that I looked at before, thirsting, desiring, now it's all quenched. My enemies they are all dead, the stronger, smarter, all shattered driven to the edge of a cliff. At first I felt satisfaction, me an MIT Reject, and Janitor at Walmart now virtually God of this world, I was the ruler of an entire planet, your ego can get pretty fucking big. However after the sex, the murder, there comes something else that creeps up in your mind, the loneliness.. All the hatred, the lust, and the desires they were co-dependent on those who existed around me, with all of them ceasing I realized that I am as much life-less as the statues around me... stuck in time.. in solitary motion. Of course unlike them I move, I proclaim, I expound my thoughts, and I do things with my body. But who's there to recognize, and remember all that I had done? To give me guilt for my heinous actions? To give me pleasures, for my love? In my old life I was a very ugly man stuck in a dead end job... people would often ignore me, and I felt like I had been the loneliest man in the world.. but their neglect also gave me life.. now I am truly the loneliest... something. Not a man, the idea of a man no longer exists in this world, I don't even remember what I am, the suspension had removed the tiniest speck of memory I had of the old world, I don't even know whether the old world existed, or it had all been a figment of my imagination... me a lonely being... I just wish it can stop.. All of the sudden I found the world moving again, I was standing on top of Walmart... with my penis in a cup, my co-worker Derrel walked in on me, he laughed at me, and mocked me.. but I was happy.
