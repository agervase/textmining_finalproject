All I remember was seeing bright , blinding light and the next thing I saw were the pearly gates , I assumed you had to go there and took a step forward , a smile plastered on my face.

Then I fell inside a dark chasm and thought "what the heck ?" And landed in the middle of a deserted Colosseum , before I had time to register my surroundings I heard a loud clang near my foot and saw a very rusty sword lying there.

A booming voice filled the void : " pillar ,  you have come here to satisfy the chaotic karma and complete the path to the afterlife , you will now face each and every living being you have ever killed intentionally or otherwise , your only companion will be the sword and the only spectator will be silence , good luck my child "

I heard in horror as some of the memories of my life began tumbling in , the Lion I had killed in self defense , the shark I speared in a time of need and finally the multitude of other beings that I had killed in my village for food , I knew what was coming for me and I knew I deserved it and that only made my heart beat faster 


I picked up the sword and examined the surroundings , it was dry , desolate and had sand the exact colour of my sword , there was little to no wind , not much in the way of shelter except a few boulders , I had a few tattered clothing on and no sign of armour. The odds were stacked against me but I thrived in it all my life , from birth to death and beyond.

After a few moments , I heard a spine chilling roar coming from the darkness at the far end of the colosseum , I gripped the sword tightly and faced the monster that burst forth.
