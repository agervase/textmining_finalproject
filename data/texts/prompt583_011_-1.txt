*Upon a raised dais flanked by vibrant ochre flags, emblazoned with the Crest of T (the universal symbol for victory since the advent of cleanbombs and the ensuing decimation of neo-anarchist forces in the Antarctic Heatplains) and fluttering fitfully in the breeze of the stale, recycled air of the Oxy-Gens, which can be heard emitting a dull roar even from two miles underground, a lone figure stands at a podium.  A hushed crowd of billions, a multihued diorama of faces hailing from all ethnographic backgrounds still in existence on Earth, stare up at him. Some watch from their view screens of the underwater villas in the North Aegean, others from the comfort of their hermetically sealed, digistructed solar-sails that skirt the rim of the Sunken Lakes of the Midwestern Wastes. Most faces, however, stare despondently up from where they’ve put down various tools and implements, in rust-grimed industrial factories and plants all over SuperCity 1, where 90% of the world’s population remains in a state of pseudo-vassalage to the Emperor Inelectii, His Magnificence Trump Barron, First of His Name, Ruler of the Americanadan Heights of the 40th Parallel, Overseer of the Panasian Peninsula, and Panarch of the Himalayan Rivieras.*

*Emperor Barron steps forward to the podium, where the Magno-Box waits to carry his words to all watching, and holds aloft a gleaming, golden scepter in the shape of a T, crafted of the purest white-gold, with veins of angry red rubies etching their way all along the length of the magnificent and awe-inspiring symbol of his Deism. The whole world falls into a silence so deep, so unfathomable, that one wonders if this tableau has become a permanent fixture, woven into the fabric of the universe forevermore.*

*Then, he speaks.*

America, is like, the best country ever.  We are like, totally going to the, uh, to the moon.  Our empire, you see, our empire, it uh, it spans not only, not only does it span the globe, which may be flat, you don’t know, I don’t know. Those experts, who pays them? They don’t know. Our empire, it’s really big. It’s the biggest.  

When I first talked with Mr. Musk, very smart guy, knows his stuff, his rockets, great guy, he told me “Mr. President, you’re a smart guy.  You know that, um, you know America, being a great western nation, can bring lots of good things to lots of people.  Well, Uh, we can bring even MORE things to MORE people, if we put them, those people, in rockets, and send them to places like Mars and Venus and the Moon.”  And I thought, you know I thought, that’s just a great idea.  Really wonderful. That idea, is just what we need to revitalize the economy. 

So I’ve talked with my people, who are just really the best people at what they do. Fantastic, really smart folks.  We’ve, uh, I’ve decided that, in order to continue making us great, I said “hey, we have all these workers. These hard working, American workers, and they have trouble finding jobs. Not enough jobs for Americans, you know, here on Earth.” And so, um, so we are working on a plan, a plan to fly our people, people who really deserve a chance at the American dream, to different planets, starting with the Moon, which we are calling ‘America #2.  Now, this plan, this is very important. This plan needs money. Lots of money. Now I, I know this, because I have lots o f money.  Every day, I wake up, and I have to make these decisions about things that cost lots of money.  So let me tell you - I’m good at making these kinds of decisions.  These, this, decision with like, space, and everything, it’s a big decision. So, America, I know everyone needs money, hates taxes.  We all hates taxes.  The government, What does it need taxes for, what is it wasting our money on? Wasteful!  So, you know, I’ve decided, that, I’ve decided it’s best if we just take the people who truly deserve a second chance. And, uh, with that in mind, I think it might be best, it would be best if I were to be in charge of this great venture, this brave expedition. And so, America, it is with a heavy heart, a sad heart, very sad, that I must say ‘Goodbye forever’, my friends. 

When next we see each other, I shall greet you as a King among Kings, as Ruler of Heaven and ALL CREATION!

*Instantaneously, Barron dissipates into nothingness, his advisors and other powerful economic Barronites rapidly following suit. The world, reeling from the sudden and unforeseen development, is quickly plunged into a chaos so complete, it shall never recover, the scattered remnants of mankind which live on in isolated enclaves slowly dwindling down to extinction amid the ruins of a planet that once stood as the beacon for all that is wondrous and terrible about life in the universe.*

*Far from the speaking hall where the Emperor made his final decree as ruler of Planet Earth, though not so far as to be out of sight from the surface of Earth, thousands of miles away, a little boy looks up from playing with his clonemates in the rubble of the Old Republic of California, and sees a bright flash high above in the stratosphere. He points to it - “Grekai, Joqzan, look!  Above, in the Great Blue! A star!”*

*”Makutan, you idiot. There are no stars left in the sky, not since Emperor Eric, Blessed be He, decreed star worship anathema to our healthy economy and clouded the sky with his nutritional smog” his clonemate Grekai answers irritably. “Now stop dreaming and come help us gather whitestone for dinner tonight!”*

*”Yea” adds Joqzan, another levelheaded member of their Tubecaste, “And make sure to prioritize the whitestone from the legs - that’s where the most marrow is.”*

*Looking up, and finding the sky dismayingly empty, Makutan lowers his eyes back to the ground they are traversing. “You are right, Tubemates, I am sorry for my childish flights of fancy.”*

*”It is no worry, Tubemate Makutan. Just remember, if you ever lose your way, recall the The First Tenet in our Pledge of Allegiance: Economy over Equality.   With that, you will never truly be lost. Come, let us return to the Laboratory. The sky is turning green, it is becoming late in the month of summer.”*

*And so they went, jovially reciting the Tenets encoded in their DNA by CRISPR Labs all those months ago. Makutan, ever the dreamer, couldn’t resist looking up into the beautiful haze of the Great Blue once more, hoping beyond all hope to see a star, just once, before his Ascension into the Soylent Ether.*
