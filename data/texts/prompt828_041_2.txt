 The lift hurtled ever downwards, the floor display flashing as each floor passed by, small beams of light flashing between the gap in the doors.

Shaking my head, I snapped out of the day dream, it felt so real, the gunshots, the screams, the blood, *oh so much blood.* Then came the falling feeling, like a black hole had opened under my feet.

What seemed like an eternity passed as the lift slowed its descent into a stop, glancing at the display it showed Floor 8.311. Every now and then the display would flicker, the number 8 distorting to display **'H.311'** and what looked like red oil dripping from behind the electrical display.

Most people would freak out over this, but I became accustomed to it, technical glitches were common in the office, the niggles in the new system were still being ironed out, with the new display referring to floors and sectors, there was bound to me some teething issues and I must have hit the wrong button on the way down.

The doors opened with a resounding bing as the speakers crackled into life.

*“Welcome to floor 8.311, enjoy your stay”*

Static cut in at the end, I was sure it sounded like a laugh, but shook it off as being over tired.

Sighing at my mistake, I stepped out into the atrium, i'd never been to this floor before and something felt different, almost wrong.  The floors and walls were white, almost too white.

*“Hello..?”* I called out, my voice echoing through the room.

*Silence.*

The lift doors closed behind me before I had a chance to react, looking around I couldn't find the button to call it back, they must have still been working on this floor, *damn.*

Spotting a couple of doors across the room, I walked towards them, my footsteps echoing around the empty space as approached. *Jackpot,* the left door displayed the *'Exit'* sign, reaching for the handle and opening the door, I was about to take the stairs up when I heard it. The sound of a Harmonica cutting through the air, it was beautiful and sad at the same time, the notes cutting deep, a shiver ran down my spine as I stopped and took the door to the right.

Closing the door behind me I looked around, it appeared to be a bar. Pool tables stood in the centre of the room, a variety of booths and chairs covered the rest of the floor. This must have been a break room for the staff, we didn't have so much as a microwave, and the 8th floor had a damn bar! Across the room sat a lone figure, his eyes closed and face scrunched in concentration as his hands opened and closed around the instrument, the closer I got, the the deeper the notes cut into me.

I was about five meters away when he realised I was there, he stopped playing and looked at me, setting his harmonica down on the bar, a confused expression on his face.

*“Why are you still here?”* he asked, the confused look turning to suspicion

*“Didn't you see the stairs? Have they finally locked the door?”*

*“I don't understand?”*

The stool scrapped as he stood up and walked towards me sighing.

*“Allow me to show you”*

He placed a single finger on my forehead, the floor around me cracked and decayed in an instant as his shape twisted, wings erupted from his back, his fingers turning into claws, clothes ripping as his muscles expanded and armour plates formed around his flesh. I was in a familiar room, *my room*. That was the first time it dawned on me, the vision I saw in the lift wasn’t a dream, i'd come back from deployment and found her cheating with her roommate, i'd shot them both before turning the rifle on myself.

*“Wh-what are you?! I stammered “Is this some kind of.. some kind of trick?!”*

*“I think you know who I am, Tom.”*

Removing his finger, the room morphed back to the bar as quickly as it changed, the wings and armour vanishing, his clothes spotless as if nothing happened.

*“T-The Devil?!”*

*“Ahh, smart one, aren’t you?'”* His eyes flashed yellow as he grinned and stretched out his arms.

**“WELCOME, TO HELL”**

Fire and smoke erupted like an indoors fireworks show as he raised his arms, filling the room with smoke and ash before vanishing as violently as they appeared.

Chuckling he sat back down on his stool.

*“But seriously, it's been a long time since anyone willingly took this door, why now, why you?”*

*“The music, it drew me here.. hang on, if this hell, where is everyone? Where's the demons, the eternally damned souls?! Why am I alone with you?!”*

He sighed and looked up from his stool

*“It happened about twenty years ago..”*
