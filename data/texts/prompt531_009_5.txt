:::TROLL BABY:::

"Wait!" I screamed. "Wait! Wait! I need to take a piss!"

His grip tightened.  
My heart sank.  
And then it happened.

He let go.

I'm not sure why I wasn't hysterical.  Maybe I'd been through worse.

"All right," he growled.  "You have a minute. Go now!"

I scrambled to my feet naked.  I tripped halfway across the room, and then I fell on my face, and hit my chin.

"Mom!" I screamed in agony.  I felt the tears on my face.

Yes, I’m a full grown man.  And I was sobbing.  I live alone - if you can call this living:  I’m a prematurely aged man in his thirties.  No wife.  No children. Here screaming for my dead parents.

But the words didn't come out.

I heard him laugh.  
It was a dark, but beautiful voice.

I looked behind.  A handsome man in a black suit sat at the foot of my bed. He was staring at me with a smile.

"There's nobody here to help you, my friend," he said.

He looked up.  He pointed up.

"And from the way you guys run things...  The folks up there seem to have forsaken your types as well."

He looked back at me.  His eyes turned.  They burned red.

"Thirty seconds.  Or you piss all over this carpet."

The human mind works in irrational ways.  It makes up all kinds of ideas to survive and cope with traumatic experiences.

In that moment, all I could think of was about how I didn't want to piss all over my five hundred grand rug.  I'd made my money the hard way.  I didn't grow up rich.  I’d survived in this country the hard way. I wasn't going to let this troll destroy what I'd earned.  It was an imported rug.

I stood up and ran. In a flash, I was on top of the toilet.  I pissed hard naked.  It burned.  It was hard.  I saw the blood pour out of my dick.  I cried quietly because there was a fire inside my head.  

How I could save myself? I wondered.  
And then I remembered something.

I began to look frantically around the bathroom for a cross.  It was an old trinket.  Hidden somewhere inside my atheist’s closet.

I found it. 

I was still naked.  
It was a tiny cross.  
Nowhere to hide.
But I couldn’t lose it.
I knew then that it would save me again.

So I swallowed it.

My throat hurt and burned as I felt it go down into my gullet and into my stomach.

"Enough!" I heard a deep whisper.

His hand came right through the wall, and then I saw a flash - it swallowed me through the walls and back into the fiery hole in the floor.

It all went hot white:  a flash like a bright white flame.
I closed my eyes  

And then it was quiet again.  Quiet in a beautiful green garden.  You could even hear the birds in the background.

I heard a voice and I began to open my eyes

"Do you want it?" said a gentle girl's voice.

It seemed so familiar.
I opened my eyes.  
It was Becca.  

We were sitting together outside our school building.  It was almost forty years ago.  Yes, I'd been here before.  I remember this place.  

She hadn’t aged a day.  My God, the guys used to say that she was amazing with her mouth. She was so badass.  Her cool buzz cut.  Her amazing skin.  I'd never liked a girl as much as I liked her.  And here she was finally spending time with me.  I wanted to get to the grand finale.  

Fast.  I’d been waiting forever.

"Do you want it?" she asked again.

"Want what?" I laughed nervously.  My voice felt so...  

So juvenile.

But everyone had told me that she was a slut.  
I wanted her.

“Well, I’ll give it you,” she finally said.

She took off the cross she was wearing. She took my hand.  She placed it in my palm, and closed it.

"You're such a weirdo," she said looking at me.  "Here keep it.  I’m an atheist now anyway.  You need it more than I do.  You attract more trolls now than even I do."

She looked at my face and laughed.
I must have looked utterly disappointed.  

I mean - here I thought she was going to give me a blowjob;  and all it was - was an invitation into the friend-zone.

"Oh okay," I mumbled like a kid. A horny kid who'd had his blowjob taken away from him.

“Let’s go,” she finally said. “Class time.”

We started to walk back.

"It's not like they'll ever have a shooting here, man" I finally protested.  "You're so fucking dramatic."

I was angry.  I wanted my blowjob.  I’d been her friend long enough.  I deserved it.  I was a nice guy.  I deserved it.

She didn't say much.  She just rolled her eyes.

"Do you want me to take it back?" she asked.

I stared at her face.  
She looked hurt.

It was a long time before I said something, but I still remember it.  After all these years.  I still remember it.

“No, I'll keep it," I finally said.

You know.  I never said thank you.  It’s my biggest regret in life.  After all these years. I haven’t forgotten.  I still remember her.  I never got married.  I still remember her.

"You sure you want to keep that?" a dark voice whispered.

I felt a cold knife in my spine.

I looked to my right.  Across the green grounds - the sky began to turn red.  The man in the suit appeared from across the beautiful garden.  He was walking slowly towards us.  

No. He was floating towards us.  It was a moment frozen in time.

I think I screamed again.  
But nothing came out.  

Quiet.  
Serene.
We just stood there.  
Frozen.

"Would you still keep it?"  the man in the suit whispered into my ear.  

He looked younger now.  He looked like a kid with a backpack.  A familiar face.  Another loser.  Another troll.  A fucking incel.

I remember.  I've seen his face a million times.  To tell you the truth - each night I long to erase him.  I push away the intrusive thoughts and memories, but he keeps coming back.  Each night he returns.  He's just an incel.  Another troll.  A loser with a backpack filled with shit to hurt.

"Are you going to give the cross back to her?" he whispered.  “I made a bet.  Tell me.”

And then the answer came to me.  
Almost instantly.  

I didn't want Becca to suffer like me.  I wanted her to go away.  She shouldn't have to live like I have these past forty years.  Every fucking night.  It's like the trolls still live inside my head.  Like a Twitter stream filled with trolls and incels pumped directly into my head.  

They never leave.  They all look the same.

No, Becca.  I’m keeping this cross.  
That’s the right thing to do.

In hindsight,  I ought to be more hysterical right now, but I guess I’ve been through a lot worse.

You know the human mind is irrational.  It makes up all kinds of things to keep us ticking.
