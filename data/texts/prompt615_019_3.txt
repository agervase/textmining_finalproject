"So, Mom, Dad, how did you guys first meet?" My son Sean said.  It was his tenth birthday, and he'd made a wish on his candles that we'd tell him the truthful answer to one question.

My husband, Lee, sighed.  "Ah, one fo the *difficult* ones."

Lee was just come back from his disastrous date with Robyn, where he'd not only insulted her culture, but her dress and had even managed to tip his wine into her plate of *pesto carbonara fusili*.

He slammed the door to his room in frustration.  "AUGH!" He yanked his tie off with the violence of Mortal Kombat, then batted his own head against the wall.  "Stupid, stupid. *stupid!*" he moaned, each word interspersed with the thunk of his head against the wall.

"Why does nothing work for me?" he spoke to himself.  He slid down the wall, melancholic at his love life.  Then he noticed a letter poking out from under his closet.  He turned it over in his hands, noticing the delicate letters on the front.  *Leroy Maurice Timson III*  In a clerical, blood-ink style.

Lee opened the letter, and began to read.

Lee had gone up into the attic, where the boxes had been left for many years.  There was a box marked *Beginnings* in my handwriting, shoved fruitlessly back to the edge of the attic, left there to be lost until one of us dies.

Wordlessly, Lee gave the letter to Sean.  Sean turned it over in his hands, opened it, and began to read, like his father all those years ago.

Dearest Leroy,

You don't know me, but I've been watching you for a long time.  My name is Iskarra, Thirteenth in line for the Limbic Throne of the Undecided Judgment.  I was initially tasked to keep an eye on you, for you were a potential rival to my family's claim.  But now I see that there is more to this.

As I watched you fail and succeed in near-equal measure, I began to see you differently.  I saw the flaws that made you weak, the clumsiness that made you witty, and the strengths that you took and gave to others selflessly.  I knew that I was a Royal Princess, as it were, but I did not see how the life of the Common folk could ever be more than tedium and terror.

But you, have shown me the truth - that *I* am the one living in tedium.  More, for all you struggle, you are so filled with vitality that I cannot help but feel my heart drawing to yours.  I wish to meet, but it must be in secret for now.  If any of my rivals were to find out about us, you would be in grave danger.

Burn this, and then come to the grave of Mary Curry, in the Saint. Michaels Church in Foulridge, on the border of Lancashire and Yorkshire, in three days' time, at 6 p.m.  I want to meet you, and to talk.

With all my love,

Ishkarra Moreillier, of the House Morel.

Guardian of the Five-Star Seals, and Watcher of the Gray Men.

Sean looked at me, awe clear in his eyes, and then he hugged both of us.  "Can I see who you really are, Mom?  *Pleeeeeeeease?!*"
