7212.

Almost twenty years had passed.
But I was a blink away from yesterday.
What had it been.
What had gone wrong.
Why this day.
Why again?

What tragedy kept me from moving on.

I paced across my apartment.
Anger gripped my mind.
Constant, relentless anger.
I was tired.
Tired of the anger.
Why again? 

What else had I left to lose that would keep me here.

Three years prior I awoke to a similar number.
5479 days over.
Fifteen years.

That was the day my wife died.
I had tried everything.
I had reset and poured ever ounce of my soul into preventing it.
Though I had no memory of the previous day I could feel the weight.
It was heavy on me.
Clinging to me.
Anger.

Death finds a way.

I had nothing left to give.
Love had been ripped from my hands.
But I had moved on.
I couldn't relive the pain again.
Waking everyday to have my heart slowly torn from my chest.
Being broken piece by piece. 
Knowing that thousands of times before I had tried and failed.

I had tried to end it all.
The cowards route many say.
But it was no use.
I would just wake again.
Same day, same hell. 
And so I vowed to never repeat a day ever again.
To pave my way to the grave.
Yet here I was.

Why? 

I stood hanging over my balcony.
The sun setting against a pale orange sky.
That had always been her favorite colour.
She used to read me a poem that she loved. 
It talked of the sky's loving, warm glow.
I used to know it by heart.
Her words so softly passing each word to me.
Like a gift.
But never since her passing. 

I stood overlooking the bookshelf.
I slid the dusty book from its resting place.
It seemed warm almost. 

"Kiss me sky

For a slumber approaches

Kiss me sky 

And wrap me in your sweet warm glow

Though I may never wake 

Slumber eternal

May your sweet warmth hold me forever more. "

Tears dropped softly against the page. 

I noticed a bit of paper tucked into the pages. 
A bookmark of sorts.
As I pulled it from between the pages I felt a sudden peace wash over me.
The paper had a note scribbled onto it. 

"There is no greatness like that of love.
Relentless in its way.
It holds us up higher than we could ever stand on our own.
Propping us up for the world to see. 
But more importantly allowing us to see how great we ourselves are.  

You make me a better person.
You hold me higher than I ever thought I could stand.
There is no greater gift in this world.
Even when I waver, or fall. 
Know that your love will always hold me safe. 

I love you. "

I can't bring her back.
But I can feel her warmth again.
