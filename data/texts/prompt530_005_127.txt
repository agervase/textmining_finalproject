“Welcome to the dragon’s hoard.” I say from behind the counter, welcoming a new set of adventurers through my austere wooden doors. Sometimes these folks are just coming in for a quick drink or two, I don’t mind.

Okay I do mind, but I’m very good at convincing myself I don’t. Still, I retain my hope that my guilds roster might be expanded every time i hear the door chime. 

“Err yes. Dragon’s hoard, this is one of the top adventuring guilds in Faeleyd correct?” The short fat adventurer asks. 

I simply nod my response, controlling my hunger-- my desire for more *loot*.

“So how does joining the guild work? I heard that you have to pass a rigorous exam, but I hear your adventurer training is second to none.” He continues blabbering at me.

I pull out a stack of papers from behind my desk. “No tests. You just have to sign this contract to wear our crest on all heroic deeds you perform.”

I fail to mention that we *used* to have a test. I had to relax the requirements for joining our guild. Adventuring is a dangerous business. 

The taller one eagerly snatches the papers from me and begins reading. *Ha idiot.* The real parts of the contract are written in draconic in invisible ink. I spend the time looking at his companion awkwardly. After what feels like an eternity he nods, “Everything here looks to be in order and acceptable Iolas.”

“Good. good. I hope you’ll enjoy your time in *the dragon’s hoard*” I say, I’m all teeth now. “My assistant Kali will escort you to your rooms. You’re to awake at first bell to begin your training. You’ll remain at trainee status for six months until I am satisfied you will not be a danger to your fellow guildmates. Thank you for choosing us for your adventuring needs.” 

I sit back as they leave, feeling the rush of power their joining gives me. My cousin Grailzurus hoards narcotics-- I feel very close to him the moment as I feel their minds entwine with mine. 

I can’t wait for the next recruits.
