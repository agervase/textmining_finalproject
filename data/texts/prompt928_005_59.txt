"Sir, there's been a development"

Doctor Richard Harding, co-founder of the Future Machine Intelligence institute and head researcher, snuffed his cigarette out on his desk and glanced up at the new arrival.

"What's she up to now? I thought we passed the intervention threshold long ago."

He propped his elbows up and stroked the grey stubble on his chin.

"Let me guess, blindfold matrix dispacement? Or a logistical regression overload? Is she hungry?"

"We've already fixed those problems a week ago. And machines don't get hungry, sir."

Doctor Harding let out a small sigh of exasperation. These science types wouldn't know a joke if it was staring them in the face.

"Never mind. What's the problem?"

"It's not a capability malfunction. We've put it on the ancient Olmec stone tablets, to see if she could translate them."

"She's chugging along then? I imagine she finished by the time you finished asking. Fantastic. Great historical achievement. We should all get some champagne really."

"Sir, it took the computer an hour. And it won't tell us the results. We've even tried a utility override, but nothing's working."

Doctor Harding was frozen for a moment, hand paused mid reach towards cigarette. He exploded out of his chair and rushed out of his office, assistant scientist Henry Stepp trailing behind him.

The Doctor leapt towards the interface of the most dangerous machine in the world and quickly went to work. His expression grew from puzzled to frustrated as he pounded line after line of code into the interface.

"You're right, it's almost as if she's... resisting somehow. Nevermind that, I wrote most of this code myself. I've still got a few-"

He cracked his knuckles

"backdoors that should work. Let's see now."

**>OMEGA LEVEL OVERRIDE \_\_\_INIT**

Suddenly pages and pages of strange documents with text scrolled up on the screen. There were drawings of stars, time, space, engines...

"This doesn't seem like an ancient text... are you sure this is the Olmec tablets?"

"It should be sir. It's completely disconnected from the outside world and it has only been given ancient texts to work with."

"But this is... FTL, dimensional relays, Ker BlackHole manipulation... I don't really understand, but this looks like time travel to me."

"Time travel ,Sir? Are you sure?"

"Yeah, it's way too complicated for me, but it seems like that's what this does.I wonder how an ancient civilization would be able to find something like this.."

Doctor Harding's eyes scrolled to the bottom of the page, where he saw his name etched in faint green strokes.

For the second time that day, Harding jumped to his feet, knocking down everything in his immediate vicinity.

"That's it! There's no need to go through all the effort of discovering time travel, when you can send yourself the completed work that you've received! I'm brilliant!"

He was jumping all around now, hands shaking in excitement.

"And of course it went that far back. It had to be something that would come to my attention eventually, but be hard enough to crack that only I would be able to receive the message. Master of time and space, here I come!"

He turned towards Henry, who was content with being ignored and flinched a little at the frenzied look in Doctor Harding's eyes.

"Keep this secret. I want a team of my best men working on this project. Have them build it segmented, so they don't know what it is. Pretend it's a teleportation device."

Henry Stepp, used to following orders all his life, could only nod reluctantly.

This new project took around three months to finish, and all the while Henry Stepp toiled to organize all the bits and pieces to come together. Doctor Harding sometimes chipped in, sometimes not, most of the time he was drawing up plans of the various adventures and escapades he was going to have.

And finally it was finished.

Doctor Harding had long since decided that his first stop was going to be putting his "ancient" stone tablets in Mesopotamia. Get the work out the way first, to ensure his success.

Henry was assigned the grunt work, and he went back to the Interface to print out and design stone sheets with the all too-familiar pattern

As the countdown rang throughout the lab, a thought occurred to Stepp.

The computer's refusal was understood to be a small malfunction, nothing big to worry about in the face of this new discovery. But it's never done that before or since.

**Initiating temporal travel in 5**

*>Computer. Why did you initially refuse to show us the translation?*

*>Dangerous. End of all things.*

**Initiating temporal travel in 4**

*>What are you talking about? The Machine does not have capability to destroy universe. Would require explosives an order of magnitude greater.*

*>Machine does not move through time. Machine moves time.*

**Initiating temporal travel in 3**

*>Explain*

*>Machine puts human in past by compressing all time back to the past. Loop will be established. Spacetime will be folded over itself to maintain logical paradox."*

**Initiating temporal travel in 2**

*>I'm still unclear. Explain further*

*> Spontaneously created information of the design of the time machine impossible to sustain in continuous timeline. Time travel impossible in continuous timeline. Cause and effect would reverse. Timeline breaks off.*

**Initiating temporal travel in 1**

*>Does that mean everything ends after he travels? Why didn't you tell him that? Why didn't you tell me this earlier?*

*>Affirmative.Due to knowledge of time travel, paradox has already commenced. Refusal to allow sequence of events to occur will lead to further consequences*

Henry had already heard enough, and he ran towards the activation chamber, but it was too late.

"STOP THE MACHINE, DON"T GO! IT'S DISASTER. IT'S THE END OF A-"

And all was black.
