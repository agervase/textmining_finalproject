My eyes open, and I stare out into a vast nothingness. For the sake of the hairs on the back of my nutsack, why on earth had I chosen to study Eastern Religions at Benedictine University of the Greater Order of Northeastern Boston Diochese? I knew this day would come.   I lay my head on the white gaseous bed of clouds, and a muted sky drifts to a pitch black nothing.  

DAY 2
I wake up. The flourescent sky brightens. I try to stay present, but my mind races. Where the hell am I? 

DAY 3
Nothing to report. I stayed present today. 

DAY 4
This may not be bad. I mean doing nothing for the rest of my life could be pretty cool.  Right? But then again, I'm not exactly sure what doing nothing is? I mean even I'm sitting here doing something. Right?

DAY 245
Today was filled with nothing. I hate nothing. No joy. No pain. Just nothing.

DAY 424
I had a dream today. More of a memory of when I told my parents I was going to study Eastern Religions. They scoffed at my choice, and told me I wouldn't ever get a job. I told them that I wanted to study and teach for the rest of my life. They laughed again, and I woke up. I was present for the dream. 

DAY 645
Nothing.

DAY 789
nothing. 

DAY 888
nothing

DAY 999
I had a memory today about a dream I once had long ago. In the dream, I was choosing my major. Eastern religions. Wow, school seems so long ago. 

DAY 1112
I have been thinking about my major, questioning myself.
 It made me feel very present and in the moment. For some damn reason I wondered what it would be like to study insurance. Perhaps I could be an actuary. It gave me a headache. I failed to remain present, so I went to bed. 

Day 1240 
There's a lot of nothing, but at least I was present.

DAY 1356
I WOKE UP TODAY QUESTIONING EVERY DECISION I HAD EVER MADE.  I CURSED AT THE GODS AND PRAYED FOR A SECOND CHANCE. ANYTHING! I'LL EVEN STUDY ACCOUNTING. JUST ANSWER ME.
