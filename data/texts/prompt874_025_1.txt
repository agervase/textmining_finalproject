I wasn't there to see it. But I definitely felt the ripples just like anyone else. Especially, the burns on my skin. 

Just weeks prior, word spread that Demas's high Arch was at his end days. Crowds flocked to pray for him. Kings, Queens, Presidents and high Nobles of all constitutions flew to his wing. The last of the Origin. 

Though his history and name predates written text, everyone knows the fairytale; of the 6 that met The Angel and sung his song, by words, sigils and runes in the gilded land that would be Runeterra. One of heart, and the other in mind. One in rock, and the other in spirit. The warrior in silence. And the last in anger and love. 

Of course, no one truely believed in it. 

But when the day came, everyone felt it. 

There was no crying, not even a tear. Just pain. The shockwave ruptured through every corner of the world at once. In the days since, it has became known as *The Falling*. 

When he drew his last, his person; fair and calm, aged beyond imagination, brittle to the bone, but resilient in youth, exploded outwards in a morphing ball of light. No sound, not so much as a whimper, just pure white, bright as the sun itself. Those fortunate souls in immediate vicinity were vaporized into dust instantly. The transcending dark aftershock ruptured outwards infinitely as fast. 

I didn't see it coming. But by the time I heard the hell-like screeching, it was already too late, it had already hit me. Even continents away, the shadow-like wave morphed through the walls of the building at an incredible speed. The darkness looked like it poisoned whatever it touched. When the black mist ran past my skin, I was thrown to the far end of the room. All I could do was scream as the runes that dotted me fell. The soul bounded marks of ancient origin and past days burned me from arm to mind to spirit. I clawed and clawed for it to stop. **Stop it! Make it stop!** They dropped. The marks that binded my body to the shadows just dropped to the floor in a pile of ashe and dark mist. 

**To me**
**Obey me**

Nothing. 

The marks, they weren't 'alive' anymore. Neither did the runes, nor shadow puppets. They just laid.

When I finally stood up, the world was dazed like. Even through my wild breathes and bloodied hands, I recognised the chaos thst ignited. The glyphs on the walls faded to cinder. Leaving burnt outlines in their place, as the structures wobbled without their support.

Only 3 days ago did the Markembre come out with their first public statement since the Falling. 

"Good afternoon everyone, in the past week, an awakening has occured. The late Demas's high arch was a pillar of our society in more ways that one might imagine .... This is the end and rebirth of the age of magic...."
