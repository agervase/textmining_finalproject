His bony fingers un-scrolled the little piece of paper again. His eyes closed and cherished the sound of the paper crinkling again. 

He exhaled with the comforting sound.

The power to stop the pain was in his hand. The black curtains on the massive 4-poster bed would not hold his soul back from making its journey across the desert to the river of forgetting and over the small bridge into the after-life. 

What was stopping him? An obligation to duty to lead this church through these tough times? 

"No, it's more than that." He thought. He tucked away the paper. 

He used his arms to heft his body up once more. He rang the bell and the attendants parted curtains. 

"Good morning your Holiness."

In the eventide, he returned to the bed and slipped the silk robe over his body. His face winced in pain. He felt the paper in the pocket against his skin. He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled out the paper. Moving his hands and arms he made himself comfortable in the bed as the attendants closed the curtains again plunging him into darkness. 

He fingered the paper. He didn't need  to read them. 

"It needs to be done." He thought. Somehow the phrase strengthened his resolve. 

He spoke aloud with a swallow.

"This curse shall last until the end of time that no power on earth might break it. As the double dragons cause the rising of the sun and moon and transit from the over world to the under world so now must I take this same journey. Death, I welcome thee."

A chill turned the air in the room cold as ice. A voice from beyond the curtains intoned, "This curse shall last until the end of time that no power on earth might break it. I, Death, welcome you."
