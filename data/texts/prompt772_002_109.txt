We've tried to be be right nice about this eh?

We tried to sit and wait as you sorted yourselves oot and learned that you were all family, all one people.

But no longer can we stand by and watch. Our spies have apologized their way into positions of power, and our mounties are well... they're mounties. Nuff said.

Our legions of trained squirrels have gunked up every weapon in the world with maple syrup. This WILL be a peaceful transition.

Mounties will be making the rounds, as exemplars of politeness and love for ones follow person.

There will be a few new laws, that may take adjusting to, but which will send us into a brighter tomorrow. They are as follows.

1. Whenever a conflict arises, both parties will immediately apologize. This will not be an admission of guilt, but instead a reminder to both parties that they are both people, and therefore on the same side.

2. Maple syrup comes from a tree. Nothing needs to be added to it. Calling anything other than maple syrup, maple syrup, or theft of syrup in quantities larger than 3000 tons of are the crimes still punishable by death.

3. Hockey replaces football. All footballs. Equipment will be provided for those unable to afford it.

4. Health care and internet are now utilities along with food, water, and basic housing.

5. Weed is awsome. Smoke it if you want, dont if you dont, dont be a hoser who does it in public

6. All wood chopping shall be done shirtless while wearing suspenders and a hat.

7. Do your best not to be a hoser.

More laws will come as needed. We promise a brighter tomorrow, and apologize for having to be so aggressive about all this.

Have a swell day, eh?
