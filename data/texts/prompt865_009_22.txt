*Hands together.  Focus on the now.  There is no tomorrow.  There is no yesterday.  In this moment, there is only me.  There is only my rage.  The rage is in my hands.  My hands on the planet.  The rage is in the planet.  There is no planet.  There are only rocks in space.*

“Buddy.  Hey, buddy, the lines moving.”  The man behind me has a hand on my shoulder.  He’s pointing in front of me.

“Your shoe is untied.”  He looks down.  His shoe is untied.

“Thanks, buddy.”  He bends down.

I walk forward.  Kara is at the cash register.  Kara used to be beautiful.  Her slim figure, auburn hair and big smile mean others still see her as beautiful.  All I see is meat.

“Oh, hey,” Kara says.  “Haven’t seen you in a couple days.  And, what a coincidence, Dewayne just happened to make an extra three espresso with whole milk.  I mean, what are the odds?  I guess it’s your lucky day.”

“Yes.  My lucky day.”  I take the drink.  I walk out the store.

I see Laura.  She used to be beautiful, too.  She is sitting in a park, watching our progeny.  I approach her.

“A caramel latte, touch of cinnamon, touch of nutmeg.”  I hand her the drink.  I sit down.

The drink in her hands.  The hormones changing in her body.  She is about to weep.  She squeezes the cup.

“What-what happened to us?  Everything used to be so good and then, six months ago, everything fell apart.  I’m not mad.  I just-I just want to know what happened.”  She is weeping softly as she speaks.

“It was Jiarah the Conqueror.  In a fit of rage over the death of his children, he destroyed his planet.  He killed his entire race in a second and then sent his consciousness across the galaxy until it found a host.  Me.  But he was so weak from the journey, he lost control.  I have his powers.  I have his memories.  I have the power to make and unmake life and its eating me alive inside.  I couldn’t be around you or Gracie like this.  I would destroy you too.”  The words poor out of me.  I cannot stop them.  “I love you.  All I want is to go back.  I love you so much.  I want to go home, with you.”

“John?”  She is no longer weeping.  Her hormones have changed.  She is terrified.

“Nothing happened, my Laura-love.  Sometimes people just fall out of love.  That’s what happened with us.  Neither of us did anything wrong but it was time to separate.  There is no Jiarah the Conqueror, only two ex-spouses who respect each other and want the best for our daughter.”

She is better.  The previous memories are gone.  She sips her coffee.  She smiles.

“I think you should ask our Ryan from accounting.  He and you would be good together.”

“You think so?  And you would be cool with that?” she asks.  She respects me.  She does not want to hurt me.

“Nothing would make me happier.”  I lie.
