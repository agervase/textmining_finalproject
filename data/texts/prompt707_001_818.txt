as we sat there, some already glazed over from their heroin class earlier, the teacher was going over the correct way of injecting with a syringe. Mary Jane was bored out of her mind. *why does every class feel the need to go over the basics, I got it after the first three classes went over the same thing* Mary was just glad she'd had her daily smoke of marijuana before class otherwise she would be getting antsy by now.

"psst" 

Mary turned towards the sound to see Pythagoras leaning over from his seat and pulled this weird looking box with a screen and buttons on it from the inside of his jacket.

"what is that?"

"it's a calculator, hey, Do you wanna try some math?"

"what's math?"

"it's really neat, you calculate numbers and equations and stuff like that. My dad taught me."

Mary Jane was trying to figure out what he was talking about when the meth teacher Mr. Heisenberg noticed the calculator. He stopped what he was doing and practically zoomed to Pythagoras' side.

"what are you doing with that?!" he whispered in a panic "don't you know what the government will do if they find out you know how to do mathematics?!"

Just then a shrill sound started coming from the camera in the corner and school security was in the room almost instantly. They grabbed Pythagoras making sure that the calculator was out of sight from the rest of the class before dragging him out the door. 

Mr. Heisenberg turned to the class and said "I'll be right back, in the meanwhile practice what I taught you." and he left the room following after the guards.

As Mary pulled out the practice syringe she thought to herself *I hope he's not going to be in too much trouble, he was kinda cute*
