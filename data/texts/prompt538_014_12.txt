These visions confuse me. It’s always the same room, same wall being looked at. It’s a bedroom, with a tv a laptop, posters of metal bands all over the walls. I lied. Once, I saw a beautiful woods with a stream, he was walking a dog. Who is he? Give me a clue. 

I dressed and headed out to the cafe I work at part time around school. I was still lost in thought about my SM. Who is he? He likes the same bands I do, 3 visions ago there was a dvd case of my favourite Rob Zombie film near his tv, so we like the same movies. 

“Earth to Tilly!”  Called Kate, the cafe owner. I shook my head and smiled. I began to clear tables and take orders. The shift passed quickly, I was 10 minutes away from being done. I glanced out of the window and there it was. The dog. HIS dog. My soulmates dog. Tied up outside the pharmacy. 
“And a cheese toastie, please, love” said the old man at the counter. I dragged my eyes away from his dog and back to work. I made the toastie, still checking that the dog was still there. It was. I handed the customer his plate and went to window. 

It was gone. I felt sick. I was so close to seeing him. Would I have known him if it wasn’t for the dog? I don’t know. I felt deflated. I clocked out and walked home. That night I sat and cried until my eyes were sore and there were no tears left.  

A month later, I was getting ready to do some homework, when I had the vision. 
It wasn’t the usual view. It was a living room. There was the dog, asleep by the chair. I could see my soulmates legs stretched out, his torn black jeans and his blue socks. His head turns and I see Mrs Gilbert, a maths teacher from my school. She holds out a mug of tea, which my soulmate takes. I notice the scars across his wrist as he takes the mug. 
I’m back at my desk. 

Mrs Gilbert and her son moved here 2 years ago. I’m sure someone told me he want to college about an hour away. 

I need to find him. 


Sorry for the format, I’m on my phone.
