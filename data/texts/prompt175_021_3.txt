I have been in confinement since I can remember. "Why?" I hear you asking because of the fact I have appeared on over 1,000 peoples bodies. At first they thought it was a fluke that I was a newly born baby that was barely a minute old, but I was already on the bodies of hundreds - including everyone in the hospital. Instantly the F.B.I came and took me away, payed my parents and poof I was gone.

 On my own body I have only one name, the name of a boy who I have never met nor ever heard of, Well in real life that is. It's so lonely I first thought I was hallucinating; when I found out he was real and the same person as the one on my back I was thrilled. I gave up life long ago so I thought he could end it all. Kill not only me but my misery as well. 

 These thoughts quickly changed. We talked and played of each others humor, shared stories of our lifes, he was outside like the others and I was traped. I fell in love. And we just enjoyed each others company. We never even thought of how we could talk to each other like this, it never crossed our minds when we had so much fun together.

 I have talked to him since I could remember been in love with him for who knows how long. 

But everything changed today. The people I hate the most - the bastards who locked me in this hell- they opened the doors and through him in here. They through in his lifeless body and I swear to god I don't know what happened but I blacked out and woke up with his unconscious body in my arms and the facility I spent my whole life in burned to the ground.
