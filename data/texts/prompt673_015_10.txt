I

I took.

I took the joy

From you, from Life itself.

I took the laughing the smiling the running the skipping the happiness yet I

I took

I took no joy in this.

I was reviled despised fled from screamed at as I took them screaming from the joy.

I

I took the hatred.

They clamored for you were enamored by you sought to call you to their side.

I was pushed away they turned from my face and cried out for more of you yet I

I took no joy in this.

So here we are once more.

Life, let us begin anew, create together the endless interweaving teeming universe.

Let death and life be joined again from dust to dust to living once more the creation thrives in us both.

But maybe

This time

Please

I'm begging you

Life

Can I be loved too?

Self criticism - rereading it the lack of punctuation in some parts makes it hard to follow. Maybe it's because I know what's happening so I'm skimming too fast, but it breaks the flow in my mind. The goal was speed - I want death furious and alone alternately, and removing commas forces you to read faster. Maybe I overreached on speed. I'm probably not good enough to skip that much punctuation - I'm no e e cummings for sure.

Here it is with commas.

I took no joy in this.

I was reviled, despised, fled from, screamed at as I took them screaming from the joy.
