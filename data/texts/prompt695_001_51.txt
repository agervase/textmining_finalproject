By all accounts Frank Darita was an above average student. He generally made high marks in Math, English, Science, and History. He excelled in multiple sports (to varying degrees) and played the violin. Sounds like a well-rounded high achieving individual, right? Probably also had a bunch of friends and considered part of the popular crowd? Right?

Wrong. 'This kid is a nutter-butter', I thought to myself as I walked up to the tree next to the school. I could see Frank standing there again, talking with all the other kids, probably saying some crazy ass nonsense again. 

"JANUARY TWENTY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT, STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD PLUNGE AMID GROWING FEARS OF A US RECESSIONS, FUELED BY THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS" Frank bleated at the top of his lungs. Jesus fuckin christ, Frank, what thell are you talking about. Its 2005, and you're screaming things about the world endings in 2008. What the actual fuck dude. 

"FEBRUARY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT US STOCK MARKET INDICIES PLUNGE MORE THAN THREE PERCENT AFTER A REPORT SHOWS SIGNS OF ECONOMIC RECESSION IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. THE S AND P FIVE HUNDRED FALLS THREE POINT TWO PERCENT, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DROPS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POINTS" Frank, in a loud monotone. "Please won't someone write this down" he said. Psh, whatever man. 

I walked away.

Man that was a good fuckin' game, I thought to myself. 3-2 sudden death victory. Spirits were high in the locker room as everyone took off their pads and reminisced about the game. 

"That was a damn fine display of hockey out there today boys!" said Coach Boswick, walking in, the big metal locker room door slamming shut behind him. "And girls!" he added, remembering that our team was co-ed. 

Eventually one by one, people bid their farewells and left. All except me and Frank. Frank started to walk over to me. 'Oh god' I thought, this fuckin guys gunna tell me some dumbass shit. 

"INVEST IN BITCOIN, WEATHER THE MARKET CRASHES, PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR FOR THOUSANDS LATER" Frank said in his usual loud monotone. "BARRACK OBAMA TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. DONALD TRUMP TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN" he continued. 

"Yea thats great, Frank." I said dismissively. "I gotta go now, ok?" 

"MAGIC THE GATHERING CARDS TO BE VALUABLE COLLECTABLES. BLACK LOTUS AND OTHER RARE CARDS WORTH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MINT CONDITION. BUY LANDS" 

Its like he can't even fucking hear me. How does this kid function in life? Do his teachers just give him As?

I intend on writing more, as well as breaking this format and moving to a first person narration of Frank
