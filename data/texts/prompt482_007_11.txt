The truth is, I might have a superpower at this point, simply through exposure - Super powers are, after all, contagious. 

Here is how you get superpowers. First, you meet someone else with super powers. Or, better, several super powered individuals. 
And then you have something happen to you that should kill you, and you gain some bullshit physics-breaking power that stops that from happening. 

The statistics geeks say every super powered you have had a conversation with, touched, or slept with gives you a one in a hundred chance (or, to be exact, one in 124)  of making your "saving throw versus dying". Only, it doesn't stack - You get a separate roll of the "Dice" for each one. There is this neat graph of what that means, but I trust that you see the problem? 

But that is not why everyone thinks I am a power house. Ive never had that brush with death. People are convinced I must be a physical god, because 4 years ago, I was broke, recently divorced, and staring down homelessness. So when the offer came to serve the phantom his papers? Well, 5 thousand is 5 thousand. 

There is always some super powered jackass somewhere in the world who has had it with a life of crime, and wants in from the cold. The courts are all in favor of this, as long as you have not left an actual trail of corpses (and sometimes, even if you have, if they think it was unintentional). But guess what happens if a guy made of living flame with 7 bank heists to his rap sheet flies up to a police station? 

Which is where I come in. The first time, I was just the one who volunteered. But at this point, I am famous. So mister Flambee wants to surrender, and do his stint of community service digging sub-way tunnels or whatever? He walks behind me and does not get shot.
