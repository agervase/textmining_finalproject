I remember the day the bomb's dropped. Nearly every major city, not just in America, but in the world was bombed, and after that, even minor cities were bombed. I remember when Sioux City was hit. People said for years it wouldn't happen anywhere near us. Of course Chicago, and then Minneapolis were hit, and finally, Des Moines, Omaha, and even Sioux Falls were hit, and then finally Sioux City.

I myself was somewhat fortunate. I was out on a farm just north of town on my family's farm we called Raccoon Valley. It was a nice farm, and being we were in the hills just outside of town, we were kind of protected. But on the day of the bombing, my parents went into town to get some supplies. Chicken feed, dog feed and other groceries. They unfortunately never came back. The strange thing was there was one person who did keep coming back. A man with a large pickup truck full of Oreos.

See, at the time I one that contest I was 12 and that was when the major cities were getting bombed. The Oreos kept coming, though instead of being sent by semi, they were now being sent by a guy in a pickup truck. 6 years later Sioux City was bombed, and I assumed the Oreos would stop, but just like clockwork, every month, those Oreos came. I even left Raccoon Valley for a place just over the hill, and they still came. Don't know how they found my address.

&#x200B;

The last time they came though, I asked the driver where the Oreos came from, and all he could tell me was that they were from a "Top Secret" location. He couldn't tell me his name. In fact he got a little belligerent with me and threatened to kill me. I then told him I'd stop and as an apology I gave him some Apples. He then was happy again and said he hadn't seen any in years. After taking my apples, he then took off, and I decided to follow him. 

&#x200B;

I saw him head South along the dirt road that led into the ruins of Sioux City. I followed him, and he stayed ahead of me for about 40 miles, but then he turned to the east and I lost him. I decided to keep heading east but I didn't see anything and my gas tank was getting low and all I had with me in my car were a few packages of Oreos and some bottled water. I turned around and drove back home, but then I saw something.

&#x200B;

Another pickup truck passed me buy and strangely enough it had Oreos in the back. The truck then pulled over and I did the same and we walked towards each other. The man then said to me he was looking for the road to take him up to Winnipeg. I told him I-29 was about 30 miles to the west, and that he better get going before the sun went down. He then thanked me, and said that he'd been driving all day from a bunker down in Oklahoma and had decided to turn east because a huge dust storm was making it difficult to drive across Kansas and southern Nebraska. 

&#x200B;

I then asked the gentleman if that's where the Oreos came from?

&#x200B;

"Well, we've got a few bunkers of them stashed around. We had one guy who just was up here and he'd kept them in a missile silo about 60 miles west of Omaha. I just radioed him. He's a bit secretive but he thought you were trying to kill him or something."

&#x200B;

"That bastard tried to kill me!" I told the man. He was acting all like he was part of some big top secret group or something. Is he? Or does he just have a bunch of Oreos or what?"

&#x200B;

"Well that guy, Mike Dvorak's his name. He used to work for Nabisco and lets just say he goes around delivering to snack contest winners so he can find food and other stuff to trade. He's a bit of a hoarder, but he also's been keeping a lot of foodstuffs. He's a bit gruff, but I think he just wasn't sure about you. Can't trust a lot of folks nowadays. I heard there's folks out in the Chicago area that will just kill a man for the hell of it. Not even because they a part of something. They figure its the end of the world, just do whatever. I don't think that's how we should function, but maybe I'm just old fashioned. Mike for sure is. Nice guy though. Liked your apples too. How'd you keep them from being nuked?"

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to say. All I could tell him was that maybe somehow Raccoon Valley Farm was just a lucky place where things weren't too full of radiation. Who knew. All I knew was that I was fortunate to have a sort of old crotchety guardian angel sending me Oreos every month.
