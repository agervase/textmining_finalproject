As I lay on the floor, I looked over at the four strangers that had just rushed in.

I looked down and thought for a moment, "If something unfortunate that's very unlikely to happen occurs to you, are you lucky or unlucky?"

I never tried to answer that question when I asked it to myself, it's just something that popped up often. I was also debating if it was wise to clutch my bag in my arms, because It was almost certain to draw more attention to it. To be honest I usually take my backpack into stores solely for this reason. It's entertaining to watch them scope me out while I grab whatever it is I'm in the mood for. Yeah, the guy that's in here every other day is definitely gonna stuff his pack full of the 8 dollars worth of canned shit, you fuckin moron.

I pulled myself out of my head and looked back at the thieves. I glanced over it early on, but the masks they had on were odd. Duct tape and....Sailor Moon, were the first two's. Was it Sailor Moon? I never actually watched the show, so I was guessing. 
Could have just been a generic school girl from some slice of life type of thing.

The third man was turned around, so I didn't even try to see. Looked like some sort of biker or greaser from his clothing at the least. The fourth one, though, was busy hopping up on one of the center counters, sneakers squeaking as he stood up. I didn't want to turn my head too far, so I could only make out the lower half of his jacket and down.

He reached into his right pocket, and I winced back down to the floor. After a moment I looked back up a bit, and he was shifting something around in his hand. I turned away, and I heard a new voice finally speak.

"YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOW THE VICTIMS OF A ROBBERY."



(Sorry for the quailty. I never tend to write because I know I'm not very good, but I forced myself to at least write something today. Forgive my tired mind.)
