“I love you,” Alice said one last time as the world faded to black and one thought raced through my head as neurons died and consciousness slipped away. *Not again. Please not again.*

I was five years old, a little boy running through a field of wheat with the sun shining down on him. A child like that shouldn’t have a care in the world, but the sight of Alice holding my hand as I lay dying in the streets filled my head. *I love you, too.* Words I would never say to her again. Not directly. Six lifetimes I had lived, and each time I moved on to the next life and left everyone behind. Let them heal, let them grow old without me. 

You would think that I’d be the one to move on, that with all my time and experience I would have learned to let go. But I was never really the one who had to say goodbyes. Whether it was the same curse that fated me to rebirth - though I knew not what that was - or just rotten luck, I never lived much past thirty. Long enough to love, twice it was long enough to have children, but soon some trick of fate or God would take me from those I loved and leave them alone.

The first time it happened, I didn’t know what was going on. I panicked, tried to contact Rebecca, my first wife. I was a five-year-old boy, though, and however much I knew about our lives together there was no way to explain what had happened. I wrote her letters, even tracked her down after she moved back to her mother’s house, recently a widow herself, and tried her best to raise our son. 

Though I didn’t know it at the time, all I had done was convince her that losing me had driven her mad. She threw herself off the lighthouse in Dover three weeks after they put me in the ground. 

I don’t get in touch with those I left behind anymore. 

Six lives, and countless more to come. *I love you Alice, Goodbye.* I thought one last time, before running home for supper, a yapping grey-and-blue dog trailing behind me.
