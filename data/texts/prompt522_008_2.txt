"What ARE you?"  The gravelly voice echoed through my room and threaded through my mind. 

The distraction startled me, jolting my hand,  causing me to miss the target,  failing the gank.  I slammed my fists on the keyboard and toppled over my mouse.   The team chat erupted, "Wut a nub."  "Axios feeding." "Report Axios for porn."

"Dammit, Jeff!  I had that guy and you messed me up!"  I wheeled around in my swivel chair to yell at my brother some more angry and shaking from being startled.   It wasn't my sniveling 6 year old brother that filled my vision when I turned,  but instead a giant black, red, and purple demon who looked shocked.   My jaw dropped.

"Forgive me!"  It was almost impressive that the monster managed to fall to its knees, as crammed into the bedroom as it was,  "I merely wonder where Master's power comes from. "

I rubbed my temple, the demon's voice felt like iron dragged across steel bars in my mind.

"Uh, what?"  It was all I could manage. 

It bowed down where it kneeled.  Was it worshiping me?

"I am Mertronux.  I have never seen a creature conquer worlds such as yourself.  Interruptions to space-time and warping truth pale in comparison to invading alternate realities and conquering"

"Ok.  I think you're confused,  I just play video games."

It chuckled and rose.  My heart clenched.  I could feel evil flowing around me.

"Master, the "games" you play with others are impressive.  I've been slumbering for several thousand years.  While I've only just awoken, you're the most incredible creature I've seen.   You can fool the other humans,  but I can see you're something more"

Finally catching on, I smiled back to him. 

"I see.   Yeah I'm not exactly human.  I'm uber leet, if you ask me.  What's up with you though?"

"Ooberleat is not a race I'm familiar with.   I am a typical Twister.  Let me serve you.   Let us conquer this world as you've conquered others"

"Ok sure.  What does a Twister do again?"

"As I said before,  change reality."

**********************************

It's been one week since I've said yes to allowing Metronux to worship me.  He hasn't realized I don't have any true powers, but does as I say.

Winning games with him was fun at first.   But when he actually started killing those other kids playing against me in the moba, I changed to single player games.   When the fps creatures showed up in my home town,  I asked him to stop.   Laughing at my 'jokes' he handed me the keys to the demon army he created.  Pledging not to kill worked until the demon just changed people into more demons. 

He's hinting at visiting other worlds, other realities.   To invade them.   What happens when he learns I'm just a kid?
