The night always brought back memories of my time in Earth. Here iridescent galaxies stretched through the sky, clear as the oceans; stars burned with insurmountable brilliancy, adorning the black fabric of the universe by the millions, and the colorful moonlight showered the field of roses around me.

It was breathtaking, beautiful, an ineffable sight, and yet, my mind always drifted back to polluted skies, deafening noises, and unbearable smells.

I didn't miss Earth. Planets were no more than ground for my feet to stand on. It was the people that I missed. The ghosts of their voices echoed incessantly in the hollow of my heart, calling me, pleading for me to hear them, and for all that I tried, I couldn't ignore them. They were quieter than whispers, yet they rumbled louder than thunder, and every time I heard them, memories of the day we left Earth often came back to haunt me, but they never came with the brightness of the many smiles, nor the pleasant sound of laughter. No, they always brought the cursed image of the spaceship shattering, and the terrible sounds of a thousand screams drowning down the eternity of the universe.

Millions if not billions of years I drifted in that dark ocean of beautiful nothingness, losing myself in the never-ending marvels floating in its currents to maintain my sanity.

But now my feet were on solid ground, the sweet scents of the flowers bathed me, the silence was deep and perfect, and the sky was full of jewels. And yet I wished nothing but to go back to that chaos I lived in so many years ago.

Perhaps, someday the universe would come to an end, and perhaps, in its last breath, I would fade away too.

The ancient god had been right. 

Immortality was a curse. Solitude its torture.
