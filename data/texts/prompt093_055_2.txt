"Robert!"

Silence. 

I search from room to room of our shoddy apartment. The walls are painted a faded teal color with white little asterisk-looking stars dotting it every couple inches. Faint brown smudges from shattered coffee cups dot it's surfaces. These walls have witnessed their fair share of heated arguments. I walk out from the rearmost room and sigh in frustration. 

"Rob-ert!!", I bark sharply. This time the sound leaves my mouth tinged with exasperation.

"You left the damn oven on again last night asshole! Ugh! Whatever." There wasn't even anything in it. Sometimes I think he likes to do shit like this just to piss me off.  He's always forgetting things. Forgetful, short-tempered, stubborn, brusque, and few redeeming qualities. I hate that I even had to move in with him, but I can't afford to live alone in San Francisco. The cost of living here is ridiculous.  Well, technically, it's not even San Francisco. It's a little city a few miles away called Hayward. Hmph, close enough in my book though.

I grab my keys and head out, wondering if I'll have time to grab some coffee from that little hipster coffee shop a few blocks away on the way to work.

"Am I crazy?", I ask myself, wondering for the umpteenth time if talking to myself out loud is a sign that I'm a nutjob. I mean, I don't talk to myself talk to myself, I just like to bounce ideas off of myself because I don't really have anyone to talk to. I mean I do, just not when it comes to things like this. Personal quirks I like to call them. A small smile crosses my face, and falls just as quickly as it appeared. I like to keep an aloof expression on my face when I'm alone. It's relaxing, a nice change from my always cheerful demeanor.

I walk out of my ramshackle apartment building and am immediately assaulted. By nature. The beautiful day to be exact. It's always such a wonder stepping outside, the stark contrast of the inside to the outside. Something about being surrounded by a gloomy atmosphere, then stepping out into the world to begin my day always sets my spirits soaring.

"Fuck you world! The day is mine!" I laugh aloud and set off swiftly towards my awaiting java.

"I wonder if that cute barista with the perky but-"

*poof*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"-t will be there......"

"Wait a minute...what..the...?" 

Have you ever watched the old show with the girl that plays a genie and she scrunches here eyes up and nods to disappear off to somewhere else and the scene changes? It was like that, minus me being the one doing it. And it was dark. Not totally dark though, just really dim.

Strewn about on what I think is a hand-carved(what do I know, I'm not a mason) tiled floor are little dark lumpy objects.  I peer into the murky haze as my eyes begin to adjust to the lack of light and begin to make out shapes around me. Details begin to form and I look closer at the display of assortments forming a haphazard shape around me, pockets of what looks like black sand with golden candles periodically breaking the form surrounding me. Lights begin to pulse from the candles. Softly at first, then faster and more intense, stretching taller every second until they form bright bars around me like a cage.  I stare at the display in fascination, not wanting to move, but fearing what might happen if the bars get closer. Warmth begins to creep in, seemingly from the light. Makes sense right? Intense , golden light giving off heat? I reach up tentatively and extend my arm, fingers slightly outstretched, to see if I can touch them. They're warm, but not hot, nd surprisingly...bendy. Flexible isn't the right word because I can't move them, but they're kind of mushy like Play-Doh would be. Hmph. 

"Are those antlers?" I mutter inquisitively as I move my face closer to the things on the ground to get a better look. "And pine needles. And hex bags, blonde hair..." My blood runs ice cold and I recoil in horror. "Blood. Matted blonde hair and blood", I whisper softly. I can see small little pieces of freshly pulled skin at the ends of the clumps of hair.

*("Your friend was very uncooperative Azilhilith. You would do well not to displease me as he.")*

Robert? Robert has blonde hair just like this. My head snaps up at the sound of the disembodied voice. "Who's there?", I ask apprehensively. I clear my throat loudly in an attempt to conceal the fear in my voice and repeat " I mean, who's there?".  I squint and hood my eyes in an attempt to see past the shining gold bars of my alien prison, but can only see opaque white between them. 

*("My name is Niheleim. I have summoned you to this plane, the realm of mortals, so that you may do as I bid you to.)*

A subtle vibration fills the air in the space I'm in, settling at a buzzing that I can feel in my bones. I swallow the hard lump that began to form in my throat, and clutch at my left breast with a shaky, sweaty right hand to feel my heart **pounding** away. *Groan* "I'm not feeling so hot, what the fuck is goi-".

A light *thud* sounds as I slump in a messy pile to the floor.

*"Blast it!"*, says the voice as it lumbers over to the cage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**"HEEYYYYYYYYY!"**

*Groan.* I stir softly on  the cold floor. *(Why is it so cold? And hard?)* I groan again as I position my arms under me to prop myself up. Things slowly start coming back to me as I look down at the floor with my eyes closed,  the pounding in my head dimming every second.

**("HEEEYYYY! GET UP ALREADY YOU USELESS DEMON! I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET")*

"It's that voice again," I mutter as I look up. "Huh?" I notice the light emanating from the bars is gone.

"Ah, you noticed. It's about time you got up you pathetic excuse for a demon. I took down the barrier spell I placed when I summoned you. From the looks of it, I do not think I'll be needing it.", says the voice. It's a low voice, with what i would say is an English accent, but may be Irish or something else European for all I know. It's no longer booming, but sounds discernibly dejected now.

I glance up at voice's owner and am greeted by a dispirited face. Weary lines surround the mouth like sad parentheses, and dark shadows hang from sable brown eyes that look like they've spent too many hours without sleep. His face shows he is markedly worn out by something. A left hand lined with little white dots and cut from older injuries reaches up to stroke a rustic, orange beard as a sigh escapes chapped lips.

"I guess it's to be expected. I'm not cut out for this wizardry nonsense. I'm a soldier in the King's Royal Home Guard for crying out loud. What do I know about summoning powerful demons?"

Silence hangs in the air as I stare blankly at this man.

"Where am I? And who are you? And...what the hell is going on here?", I finally ask.

He snorts sharply, his face twisting into a sarcastic expression. " Where am I? What the hell. Hell. Hell. I summoned you from Hell. Don't try to play me for a fool demon. You won't like what happens if you do."

"Robert. Fuck.", I mutter under my breath. I know I'm in some deep shit now. Somehow or other, I was transported to a room that looks like it was built in the year 750 B.C., trapped in a cell by a guy that probably killed my roommate and keeps muttering about demons and royalty and blah blah blah. Damn. What am I going to do? Play it cool Alice. You've got this. Best medieval wizard role play you can think of. Go.

"I guess I should have known better than to try to fool a man of your caliber. I am filled with remorse Master, yet cannot help but feel pride in my heart to kno-".

"Silence! You are a demon! What do you know of having a heart. You plow through bodies in Hell. You torture, you kill, you maim, you torment souls for your enjoyment, and worse I'm sure. You have no heart Azilhilith.", he utters with an exasperated sigh. "Let's just get started. Ready?"

"N-". No I begin to say before I'm cut off.

"Too bad", he laughs "I am your master now and you must do as I say, regardless if you are able or not."

"Fuck you, as if. Who the hell do you think you are locking me up like this?", I say as I feel my temper begin to slip.

"I am a wizard now.", he ways quietly, as if pondering it. 

 "I am a wizard. I am a sorcerer, I am a summoner, I am a master-to-be. You will simply obey."

*(Like hell I will)*, I think to myself.
