On Iris and Ignulf the Pineful Ashen Ones

&#x200B;

When one thinks of a maiden in a tower it is easy to conjure images of helpless damsels trapped by tyrannical lords. This in turn often conjures images of gallivanting knights in shining armor waging life and limb to extricate said mistress. Yet if one were to assume this when hearing of the plight of Iris, they would be foolhardy indeed.

For the mistress of castle Lockehart is one of the most craven recluses to abstain from roaming the lands. And thank heavens for her coy composure as any whom delve into the intrepid catacombs and winding vestibules will be greeted with horrors they thought fictional. Rancid tombs and putrid chambers line the foundational crypt of the great keep. The spawn of Ignulf the Brood Queen stalk the halls, abominations of half flesh half eggs.

If one fancies themselves a fighter of the beasts of the night then take heed. The broodlings hatch when the host corpse is "killed". The eggs hatch to reveal the often partially developed dragonling. However the missing and undeveloped limbs do nothing to hinder the ferocity of the creatures as they will ravenously devour any living thing in their vicinity. An effective strategy is to burn the corpse host while it is still alive so that the babies hopefully boil before hatching, however if attempted on late stage eggsacks it often only enrages the newborn which has developed its fire resistant scaly coating.

For the few that manage to get past the spawn, the next challenge will be of wits. The titular count Lockehart was a man whom enjoyed puzzles to a disturbing degree. It had started with simple tumbler based locking systems, but as the flames of obsession consumed the count he became enraptured with protecting his most priceless possessions with ever more elaborate mechanisms. Any progress on detailing the myriad of locks and puzzles and all their solutions proves futile, as every night when the moon reaches its peak the solutions change entirely. It is like a always shifting puzzle box.

Now if one thinks that their mastery of the trivial and novel arts will be their only needed skill during the harrowing trek through the main house, they will surely be added to the corpse brood. The Pale mother stalks the halls and taunts those in search of her. She titillates them while just out of reach. One report from a mercenary band went as follows:

"We had been lost within the ever-changing walls for hours. 2 men in front of the party called out that they had spotted someone. I readied my blade in case it was more of the husks we had encountered before. As I rounded the corner at the top of the stairs I found myself on a balcony overlooking a mirroring balcony. The men were pointing at a young girl with pure white lockes and a ghostly aura, she wore a green dress that stopped at her knees. She was humming and dancing about, acting as if she hadn't noticed us. When her gaze met mine she seemed to laugh, turning on her heel she beckoned for us to follow and walked off. Disappearing into the darkness of the halls. One of the first men that saw the girl quickly clamored onto the railing of the balcony, he gauged the distance and found it to be close enough to cross with a small jump, if his legs were slightly longer her could have reached his foot across and bridged the gap. We held our breath as he lowered in preparation for his leap, just to be sure he was putting his all into this jump. As his feet left the stone railing a sudden jerk made our group fall to our feet. When I got to my feet I could see what caused the explosive movement, the balconies had receded and left a chasm in their wake, we never even saw the fate of our comrade"

The true challenge is waiting at the peak of the great castle. High up on the tallest tower resides Ignulf the Plague bearer in white. Ignulf is a rancid beast who's flesh schlocks off of her in response to her toxic fumes. However judging her flaking hide as weak is underestimating an ancient power. Her state is a result of preserving the once beautiful dragon, the beast terrified countless since times long turned to ash. Yet by willpower and dark ritual she remains, forever bound to the keep in payment for her salvation. The old count had ventured into the study of extending life near his harrowing hours. His final experiment serving as the final safeguard to his crowning jewel.
