"..And so, if you refuse to torture your fellow man, you will be doomed to suffer for all eternity!" the red-skinned Devil whirled his trident and cackled madly.

 "Okay, yeah, no problem. Do I get a pitchfork or what?"

 The Devil stopped whirling his trident, his mad laughter dropping to more of a slightly crazed giggle.

 "Okay, uhhh...what?" The red-skinned fiend looked puzzled, pulling out a small black notebook which was decorated with tiny cartoon pitchforks, "I've got you here on multiple counts of petty theft, lying, threats of harm against others...nothing I see here suggests you'd be on the level of a Hitler or Stalin. What's your deal?"

 "Sir, I worked retail for *fifteen* fucking years. I was killed in a stampede of shoppers." 

 The Devil took a step back, "Ah," he replied, as if it all made sense now. "Listen, I don't really think you belong down here getting tortured. After fifteen years as a wage slave, I'm actually impressed you didn't kill anyone," he dropped his voice and slid closer to the damned soul as if sharing a secret, *" Most veterans of retail do, you knowâ€”their managers never know what hits them."*

 "Trust me, I thought about it. Seriously though, when do I start?" 

The Devil handed his pitchfork out for the soul to take, "Shit man, you can start right away." He pointed down a long and darkened hallway, "Walk straight down that hall until you see the three-headed dog, take the first left and proceed through the fires of everlasting woe, and straight through the P.E.T.A. meeting-"

The damned soul interjected, "Wait, P.E.T.A. is actually evil, not just incompetent?" 

The Devil smiled broadly, "They kill more defenseless animals per year than any other organization. Face it, blood sacrifices are hard to come by, these guys fill the niche in the market. Anyway, once you get down the last flight of stairs, you'll be in the department of bad managers. I'm going to make you head of the torture division there." 

 The damned soul smiled broadly, "I'll get right to work, Sir."


As he walked off, the Devil shivered. "Remind me to never get on the bad side of those retail workers. They give me the fucking creeps."
