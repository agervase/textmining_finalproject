5 o clock. Time to check my temple. It’s been weeks since I finished my temple, no gods showed up yet. I stop by the entrance, took a deep breath, hoping that some entity would greet me. Slowly pushing the wooden door open, I peer inside and...

Nothing...

It was empty as always. After taking a couple steps in, I wandered out of my temple and headed home for the day.

5 o clock. Time to check again. Today it’s raining so I ran towards the temple. Drenching in rain, I stop by the entrance. Today felt different, the rain certainly helped that. Took a deep breath, and cracked open the door, peered inside and...

Nothing...

I felt a gush of loneliness come over me. I started to cry, and headed back home.

Next day rain again. 5 o clock rolls around, but I don’t bother with the temple. Maybe my temple was too small. Maybe there’s not enough offerings. Maybe there’s not enough decoration. Whatever the reason, no god would come see me.  No god would come see me in my temple.

The next day the rain does not cease. 5 o clock rolls around, I think about the temple, maybe today the god is here to greet me. The road is muddy and my progress is slow.

I finally arrive, and my body goes dumb. 

The door is open.

The God is here. I stumble, trip in the mud. I struggle up and keep straggling towards my temple. I barge in and inside a middle aged woman stood near the right wall.

“H... Hello...” I stutter. She looks bewildered and surprised. 

“Hi... is this your shed?” She asks.

“This is my temple.” Is she my God? “Are you my God?” I ask her. She looks surprised, and cracks a smile. 

“I was wondering why there were so many in flower pots stacked up like a pyramid in the back, I guess that was your alter?”

“So you’re not my God?”

“No I am not. Just waiting out the rain"

I felt defeated, but not sad or empty. It finally makes sense. She thought it was a shed, not a temple.
