*Let me tell you a story. About a man named Lazarus. He met an eldritch being named Jesus, who brought him back to life. What Jesus forgot, was to allow him to die again. He has been alive for 2,000 years. It's now early on in the AD. And he has sought out an ancient room, buried 33 meters deep below a pyramid.*

*He has taken the stairwell to a place called... The Architects Study...*

"So you're the immortal one huh? They call you... Lazarus, no?"The Architect asked.

"Yes, of how did you know this?"Lazarus asked.

"Fate abides by my will. When I wish for it to work alone, it abides by likelyhood... Mathematics and such."The Architect shrugs, before returning to carving on a piece of stone."I could ask you the same thing about how you knew of my study..."

"An ancient spirit told me... He had the same conundrum..."Lazarus said.

"Hmm... Selvet right?"The Architect stopped and turned around.

"Something like that.. It's hard to keep track of anything after 2,000 years..."Lazarus said.

"I know why you're here... You say that what you have in your eyes is a wish for rest... But that's not what I see in your eyes.. What I see.. Is a wish for *death*. The two are twins you know..."The Architect said.

"Y-Yes... I believe that it's pointless to go on living anymore..."Lazarus said.

"Well... I won't stand by... I will kill you in my everlasting mercy..."The Architect stood up. And summoned two sickles..."Tell me... Do you really wish for death..?"The Architect asked.

"I do..."Lazarus said.

"Then so be it..." The Architect decapitated Lazarus with the sickles..."And so nothing is left.. Except for your regrets..."

And that is why, Lazarus no longer lives to this day. For he sought death strong enough, that he died.
