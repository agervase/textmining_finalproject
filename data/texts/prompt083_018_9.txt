We are methodical. the Gavrilo Princip society was formed by an unknown person somewhere in the 1930's, or so I was explained.

They contacted me via letters, delivered by pigeons. It was very tedious and inefficient but very secure. The day I received the first memory flash drive it seemed like any other delivery. I would found much later about the pigeons.

My first  instructions were clear, they contained a dossier of all my life  from the cradle till the day the letter was written. They somehow knew I had worked as a snipper agent for over 25 years. A lot of my army missions were classified, but somehow this Princip person(s) knew them all. 

The first task was simple: "We know about you, what you must know about us is that we strive to change the world. Once a member, always a member. Dissidence and treason are punishable by death, quick death. Would you like to join us?"

I followed their contact instructions and ever since then I ocasionally receive new tasks.

Tasks are not optional, the Princip rely on me. On my expertise. I see myself as a valued member of a team with unique skills, and I thinks that's how they see me.

My first tasks was the CEO of a company notorious for privatizing water sources. I took down two of the board members and their CEO the same night. Its funny that the media didnt really cover the killings. We like it like that cause that's how we know they are scared, the people who know about the high profile level assassinations don't wanna make a fuzz about it.

I am one of a few who are tired of a corrupt system. Some may think we are evil, but the way I see it, we've rid earth of some of the most despicable men, they are almost always old men, but there are other as well.
