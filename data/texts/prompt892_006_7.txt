"Skellie, we need your research aptitude" they said. "You're the only one who could find what we need to know" They added. "We need to know if maybe those who came before had put their best and smartest into the internet to save them." They tacked on. 

"Well Skellie, they were right. You are dumb and naive." I said to myself. It had been 2000 years since Earth fell. They had created the greatest universe spanning empire, but some disease wiped their home planet to nothing but slugs and insectoids. Luckily, they built to last. As the Head Researcher for the Intergalactic Chamber of History, Skelligatia "Skellie" Chapayna had been asked to look into the internet spikes that had arisen from the dead planet. Having sent a suicide team to hook up his monitor to the world wide web, Skellie had been wading through the internet to find anything. Most of it was old news. The Washington Times had written an article about the plague on the Earth, the National Post had written an article on how the Emperor had saved him and his family from coming in contact with the disease. Old boring news. 

Coming in contact with something new, Skellie had renewed hope. A thing, hopefully it lived up to it's name.   Maybe the humans who had unified the galaxy had kept themselves alive.

Typing into the field box Skellie said "hey"
A blue text hovered for a second, till he got a response typed back "how are you?"
"I am good, how are you?" The blue text hovered for a second, as if the machine was thinking of a proper response. Maybe he had done it... he had found humanity again.

The text stayed still, as if it had frozen... maybe he hadn't done it. 

"Maybe this cleverbot isn't so clever."
