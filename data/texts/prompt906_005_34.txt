Agents Howard and Martinez stepped out of their sedan and straightened their suits.  Gray skies overhead threatened to rain and cast a dark shadow over the forrest of tall pines they stood in, but neither removed their dark sunglasses.  Distant thunder rolled in the distance.

Howard leaned back into the car and retrieved a black leather messenger-bag type suitcase and matching legal pad folder.  The case contained a roll of cash, a digital recorder, and a one-pound bag of potent marijuana.  The case was that serious. It was time to see Delphi.

The thought of approaching Delphi was terrifying for both of them.  Consulting the Oracle always had risks, and even a slightly misinterpreted statement could result in millions of deaths.  Martinez shuddered to think about the last time the interpretation was off; four countries in the Middle East had effectively ceased to exist as a result.

Delphi, the Oracle's official codename, lived at the end of a long dirt road in the hills that sit between Georgia and Tennessee.  The setting was more than appropriate, considering the subject. The clairvoyant, however, did not match.

Howard and Martinez knocked on the screen door of a single-wide trailer sitting on cinder blocks,  no answer.  The agents knocked again, still no answer.  In the distance, a bobwhite gave out its distinctive call and a gentle breeze blew through the trees.

*Bang*

*Thud*

The two sounds startled the agents. Howard dropped the bag while turning. Both drew pistols from their holsters and aimed in the direction of the sound.  Silence covered the forrest.

Out of the woods stepped an elderly man in a flannel shirt and cowboy hat.  An old double barrel shotgun hung, breach open, over his shoulders.  Behind him lay the unfortunate deer.

"Good to see you folks again! I hope y'all brought the good stuff!" Dan Davis said to them in his extremely strong mountain twang.

"As always, Mr. Davis. And boy do we have some questions for you!"
