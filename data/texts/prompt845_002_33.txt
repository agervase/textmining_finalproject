It was finally done. With an aching, wilted hand I typed the last line of code and ran it. It worked perfectly on the sample text. The worm was smarter than I thought, even sending out different sections based on who was mentioned in them. I smiled and ran my fingers through my hair. Well, across my head. The chemotherapy had made all my hair fall out. I reset the worm and looked through its payload: decades and decades of personal messages. Everything from affairs to manipulations that people had confided in me. When people regard you as the world’s nicest man, people trust you with secrets. 

Secrets I would now be spilling. 

The worm was designed to gather all of the messages and post them on social media, message boards, workplace websites, and anywhere else it could access based on who was mentioned. I’d spent the last two months writing it. Wilting away and writing it. It would’ve been easier without the Stage IV lung cancer, but then I wouldn’t need the worm either. I scrolled through messages. Ethan telling me about cheating on his wife, Sean sexually harassing his secretary, Helen trying to get her “friend” fired. Decades of misdeeds. I’d always kept them to myself. I’d always tried to spare people the truth. That’s what made me so “nice”. Not today. 

Today was the day they’d all hate me. 

A smile crossed my face as I considered that. They’d hate me. They wouldn’t mourn, they wouldn’t cry. I’d be sparing them the sorrow of losing their closest friend. And, as a bonus, the people they’d wronged would get closure. A single tear streamed down my cheek as I loaded the worm’s payload and clicked run. My phone buzzed and buzzed as notifications of posts and messages blew it up. I closed the laptop and laid back, eyes closed. 

This was probably the nicest thing I’d ever done for anyone.
