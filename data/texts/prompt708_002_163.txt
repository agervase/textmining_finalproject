Picture this: a felled tree, lashed to the roof of a pickup truck; a tree stump, rising through the snow like an island; and a naked girl floating in the air, pointing accusingly at me.

I will admit, when I left this morning to get a Christmas tree, this was not what I was expecting.

**YOU HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME,** said the floating girl, in a voice that rang like a bell.

"I, uh... yeah, I suppose it might *look* that wayâ€”"

**BE SILENT.**

I shut up, most of my terror offset by her rather harmless appearance. Apart from the levitation, her only unusual features were ears that might have been pointed. I couldn't see them all that well.

**TELL ME, STUPID HUMAN, WHY YOU HAVE DONE THIS TO ME.**

"My family wanted a fir tree for Christmas?" I hazarded. "I dunno. In retrospect, the fact that this one tree was standing by itself with a giant cleared-out circle around it was a little suspicious."

**CHRISTMAS?** said the floating girl. **I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS HOLIDAY.**

"He means the solstice," piped up another voice from behind me, this time sounding like a young boy. I turned, and...

It was a squirrel. I would have dismissed the squirrel entirely and kept looking for the surprise ventriloquist, but then it *waved* at me, and I gave up.

**I DO NOT RECALL THIS BEING A CUSTOM OF HUMANS, TO KILL TREES FOR THE WINTER SOLSTICE,** said the floating girl. **AND FURTHERMORE, I AM STILL BEREFT OF TREE. WITHOUT A SEED, I SHALL DIE COME SPRING.**

"Sucks," said the squirrel. "Let me guess, you were going to kill him and use his blood to fertilize the stump?"

**WOULD THAT BE INSUFFICIENT?**

The squirrel shook its little head. "Nah, Mother Nature checks out for the winter. That won't cut it."

**THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST, SCION OF SQUIRREL-KIND?**

"The blood-ritual won't work," said the squirrel, "*but*... I may or may not have an acorn for you."

**OAK TREES DO NOT GROW IN WINTER. DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A DULLARD?**

"Not usually. Not unless you gathered the acorn from a tree growing at the bend of a river. Under a full moon. With the appropriate prayers to Mother Nature. *Then*... well, then it just might," said the squirrel.

The girl smiled. It looked awful, really. Like someone smiling who'd never heard of it before, and thought you were supposed to bare your teeth like a shark. **YOU WOULD DO THIS FOR ME?**

"Sure, no problem," said the squirrel. "I'll come back tomorrow, okay?"

Without waiting for an answer, the floating girl vanished like a popped soap bubble.

"Huh," I said. "Thanks, buddy."

"No problem!" the squirrel said cheerfully. "Hamadryads, eh? Oh, and thanks for not running me over last August. That was nice of you."

"Yeah," I said, somewhat dazed. "See you later, then."

"See you! Have a merry Christmas."

I came back to that hill in April. There, where the fir tree once grew, was a titanic oak. Its leaves overshadowed the grove, where no other trees dared to come near. I swear I heard a girl's laughter, and then silence.
