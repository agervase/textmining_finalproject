"No. Please not now." I say to myself. I can feel the familiar darkening around the edges. I am receding as the blackness takes over, billowing over me. "I don't even have any canvases." The abyss does not care. "This is just really not a good time for...for m-" I fall to the hardwood floor. My body stands up, leaving me on the floor. 

...

I awake standing upright. I am staring at my latest work. "No. Goddammit. It looks like a murder scene in here." I say to my other self, the one who can't fucking control themselves, apparently. 

The wall of my living room is covered in a demented mural. Satanic goats, pentagrams, babies and such. "It really *is* a nice piece...."  I say to myself. Regardless of the dementedness and the fact that it is on my wall for Christ's sake. 

The door bell rings. "No. It can't possibly be..." I trail off as I look at the clock. "Shit. Shit shit shit shit-" the doorbell cuts me off. 

I hurry to the door. *What am I going to say?*

I swing it open. 

"Hey!" they say amiably. 

"Hey!" I fire right back. It must have sounded a little panicked. They look a little concerned. 

"Is something wrong?" she asks. 

"No, Mom, it's just that...a pipe burst! My kitchen is flooded. We're going to have to go out to eat." I say, practically patting myself on the back for my ingenuity. 

"Oh no! Well I'm sure that your father could take a look at -" 

"No!" I shout, "It's fine, really. I've already called somebody and they'll be here shortly." 

They both jumped a little when I shouted. Now they look unconvinced. I stand in the doorway awkwardly. 

"So, are we ready to get going or what?" I say. 

"Well you don't look ready." Mom says. 

I look down. *Shit.*" Blackout me found the time to change. I'm wearing an old shirt that's speckled with old paint, and shorts that I've had since I can remember.

"Shoot. I guess I got so caught up with the whole pipe thing that I forgot. I'll go change." I slam the door in their face. I can't risk it. They have gone to church every Sunday for the past 40 years. They can't think I made that.

I run to my room. My good clothes are piled on the floor. I pull my painting clothes off and throw them to the side. I am halfway up my pant's zipper when I hear the door open. *Shit. Fuck. Shit.* There is a spare key under the carpet! Of course I've told them about it before. They had to come water my plants while I was in Paris! 

I run to the living room with my pants still unzipped. I find them staring at the wall. 

"It's not what it looks like!" I scream, not knowing what else to say. It is, indeed, exactly what it looks like. They turn to me. 

"It's...about time." Dad says.

*What?*

"What?"

"Son. Did you think we didn't know about the black outs?" 

"How did you...what blackouts?" 

"Oh, please. Did you think we didn't have anything to do with that?" 

"What the hell are you talking about?" 

"We made a deal, son. When you were born."
