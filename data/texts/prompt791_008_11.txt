He chuckles, pulling his blood-red tie straight and tight against his spotless white collar. Sliding into the pitch black suit, he allows his mind to wander. He had it all, fortune, fame, feminine admirers... and to think he used to be a small time, starry eyed shopkeeper.

See, he'd seen the big picture, seen what the other people at the guild hadn't seen, or didnt want to see. He'd seen opportunity. Because what use are adventurers? Eventually they'd have raided every tomb, killed every lich and shattered their phylacteries twice over. Being involved in the 'protection of civilisation' by adventuring companies was ultimately a finite business.

Thats where he came in. 

At first it was a one-off sale, a bunch of seeking arrows a team of adventurers had deemed "not worth their time", leaving him with the expensive stuff. So when a group of Goblin mercenaries contacted him for the stuff, he eagerly jumped at the chance, even turning a small profit on the arrows.

It was about 2, maybe 3 weeks later those same adventurers came crawling back, down 2 of the original 5, beat up and bloodied. They'd faced bandits with arrows that came in at impossible angles and lost, miserably. And since adventurers are often not the brightest of the bunch, his actions had gone unnoticed.

And so it continued, sometimes he supplied one side with weapons effective against the other, sometimes he sold them ineffectual rubbish. But always, always he ensured that he supplied both sides of the conflict evenly, and with ordinance hitting harder than before.

What was just a run down shop in the slums of Javaaz turned into an empire in the shadows, with him the Emperor of it all.

Some found out of course... but they were few and far in between and, more importantly, easily dealt with. They called him a monster, called him things even the demons below would find offensive. 

But what was he to do? It was not personal after all, just business, lucrative, wonderful business.
