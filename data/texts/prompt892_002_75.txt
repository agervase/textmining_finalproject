The planet was dead, and it was talking.

Captain Kar'zul of the Galactic Expeditionary Force peered at the computer's analysis of the planet.

"It's strange, sir," his First Officer said. "No signs of actual life, but we're picking up a huge amount of chatter in the EM frequencies."

"And the heat signature?" Kar'zul asked.

"Massive, sir," the FO said. "It's considerably hotter than the surrounding planet, but too hot to be organic life. It's also the source of the chatter."

"Might be an AI, sir," the Science Officer suggested.

Kar'zul nodded thoughtfully. It wouldn't be the first time that they'd stumbled across a planet where advanced technology was the only remnants of life. "But no radiation signature above background levels. That's the usual way they go."

"Disease, maybe," the SO suggested.

Kar'zul nodded again, and made a decision. "Broadcast on all frequencies in use on the planet. Announce our presence, and see if you get a response."

The FO tapped the screen for a few moments and then spoke into a microphone. "Attention members of this planet. This is the Starship Xenon. We are currently in orbit around your planet. We wish to communicate with any sentient being on this planet."

The computer was running language analysis on the alien chatter, and it would translate the FO's message into the alien tongue as best as it could.

After it had bradcast, Kar'zul and his two officers waited.

"Spike in the chatter below, sir," the FO said suddenly. "Wait, now it's dropped off. It's gone, sir. The planet's gone dark."

"Well, at least we know they heard us," Kar'zul said. "Any chance that-"

He was cut off by a flashing red light on the FO's panel, and a warning klaxon that drowned out the low hum of the ship's engine.

"What's that?" Kar'zul said.

The FO was tapping the panel frantically. "Their response, sir. Five projectiles, launched from the surface. Time to impact: four minutes and sixteen seconds."

"-----^* ," Kar'zul said. Perhaps the projectiles were ships, but he doubted it. "Options?"

"Not enough time to start the light drives," the FO said. "Evasive action will buy us more time, but not enough. The projectiles appear to adjust course to ours. Defensive measures may be able to shoot them down before they reach us, but..."

But they couldn't shoot until they were certain whether the projectiles were missiles or emissaries from the planet. Kar'zul leaned over the FO and spoke into the microphone. 

"Computer, broadcast this message to the planet. *This is Captain Kar'zul of the Starship Xenon. We come to your planet in friendship. Please advize as to the nature of the objects launched on an intercept course with us.*"

There was silence for a moment, and then the computer screen flared with a response. An unorganic voice said, "We have launched nuclear warheads at your ship."

"What the hell?" Kar'zul said. "Why? Where is your humanity?"

Another pause, and then response came, but this time it was a chorus of voices, all with one message. "We have no humanity."

The FO said, "Radiation signature detected on the projectiles, sir. Time to impact: three and a half minutes."

"Action stations," Kar'zul said. "Shields up. Take all evasive maneuvers, and shoot down those missiles. And get the light drive online as soon as you can, and jump us to the other side of this system."

"Yes, sir," the FO said, his hands already flying over the computer screen.

Kar'zul sat back in his chair, and waited as the warheads roared towards his ship.

No humanity? *Who were these people?*
