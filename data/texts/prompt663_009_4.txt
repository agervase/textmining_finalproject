The light was blinding. I didn't expect anything but darkness. Slowly details come into view. One, two, no it has to be a dozen of them. I can only describe them as blindingly white and perfectly round. There's a man here too, no not a man, he looks human, but I can feel he is not the same as me.

&#x200B;

"Hello, my name is Peter. Do you know where you are?"

&#x200B;

"Yes."

&#x200B;

"That's good. I am going to ask you a question, its okay if you don't fully understand right away, but please just trust me and answer with your heart."

&#x200B;

"Okay."

&#x200B;

"If you could change any single decision, what would it be?"

&#x200B;

"I wish she said no"

I'm not exactly sure whats going on. It's the first day of the school year and theres a sub in this class. What sort of teacher misses the first day of school? The sub's name is Mr. Smart, pretty dumb name if you ask me. 

&#x200B;

He talks to us casually for a few minutes, then asks us some math questions. I guess thats pretty appropriate, this is an algebra class after all. I quickly realize that the students in this class are either unwilling or unable to answer the questions. It wasn't that hard to see really, there was only about two or three of us really trying. 

&#x200B;

The sub abandoned trying to teach about halfway through the class, I don't blame him really. Still I wonder if he just doesn't care or if its just because its the first day of the year. Either way its nice that we can sit around and just talk.

&#x200B;

Megan was sitting in front of me, she turned around and then motioned to her right. "Hey Brent, this is my friend Julie."

&#x200B;

\--------------------

&#x200B;

I can't stop thinking about her. It's been almost a year since we met. I need to make a move. Stop being such an idiot, just ask her out.

&#x200B;

So I planned it all out. I had saved all the little notes we passed to each other between classes, almost a shoe box full at this point. I bought a bouquet of red tipped fringed tulips. Tomorrow is the 16th. Exactly one year after we first met.

&#x200B;

Her house was farther from the school then mine. It had become almost habit for the two of us to stop at my place for an hour or so before she left to go home. This is my chance. She sat down on the couch and I grabbed the shoe box and flowers.

&#x200B;

"Julie, will you go out with me?"

&#x200B;

She sat there motionless, completely quiet. It felt like an eternity.

&#x200B;

"No." 

&#x200B;

\--------------------

&#x200B;

"Peter? PETER???"

&#x200B;

"Yes? I am right here."

&#x200B;

"Why can't I remember her? What did you do?" 

&#x200B;

"I did exactly what you asked. I made her say no."

&#x200B;

"I... I don't understand, why am I here?" I fell to my knees and pleaded with him. "Please, explain to me what happened."

&#x200B;

"Ten years ago you and Julie got married. You were happy, for a time. Eventually neither of you were happy anymore. You became severely depressed. You threw your life away and slowly started dragging Julie down with you. She became fed up, and she divorced you. This caused you to become even worse, and eventually you committed suicide."

&#x200B;

"But... if she said no then why am I still here?"

&#x200B;

"Your decisions were not changed. You still became depressed. You still pulled the trigger."

&#x200B;

"And Julie?"

&#x200B;

"She went on to live the life you wanted her to have."
