For all intents and purposes it seemed to be a normal robbery. I fearfully agreed to give up my week's savings for my life. But as it fell onto the ground, he shot at it for all he was worth until it uttered a sound. A *screech*. Then it went silent.

"What the fuck?" was all that left my mouth as it gaped open. The stranger looked at me and cocked his hat.

"You can thank me later," he said, as he left. I looked again at the wallet, as blood started to stream out of its wound. A gleaming blade was concealed in the flap. At once, I knew what was going on.

Decepticons. 

I stared at the items lining the alleyway, as they slowly rose into action. I dumped all the items I was carrying onto the ground and ran for my life, footsteps thudding behind me.

I made it back to my house, but it was my house no more. All the other houses stopped in motion as they murdered their former inhabitants, looking at me. Then the ground shook as they moved towards me. Why was I getting targeted by everyone? I thought as I dashed off, not knowing my destination. I needed to find the stranger again to get my answer.

I reached a deserted part of the city, all items long gone to start the war against humanity. As I enjoyed a respite against the disaster, I heard something that made my blood freeze.

My phone was beeping. But i dumped it earlier in the first dark alley. I turned around, and the Samsung Note 7 had sharp, vampiric teeth. "GPS tracker," it offered, its robotic face twisted into a smile. And as it lunged at me, I saw a huge red button on the phone screen.

It read 'Pause'.

And with all my might I threw myself at the phone and pressed it.
