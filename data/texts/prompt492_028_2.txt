He's a right ornery shit, he is. A plucky little try hard! I'm sorry that you've ever been a piece of his business, I really am. To think of your hands being tied and leaving you to wither away. It's almost as if he wanted you to die and get your lesson's worth. Dead? Brain Dead? What's the difference? An honorary doctorate in dying. Who ever heard of such a thing? No. When you went, you went, and nothing's going to ever change that. But, my dear, I want you to remember that you were loved...
When you were loved, you were loved. 
When you went, you went, and they loved you even for it. 
And the they that they were, were a loving bunch who tried to love you out of what had happened... the hearts of men can't change what's been done.
I've never gotten very good at this part... It's hard to speak about "nothing" as it were. Well, the happening of a "nothing" I suppose. When you were being kept around, it was mostly by your own will. You don't remember, but you held on for the ones that came to see you. They came and sang for you. They came and prayed. Eventually, though they never chose to forget, they moved on to love what could love them back. At least in a way they knew of... They lived their lives and some of them thought of you as they passed through my little brother's scythe.  They've all moved on. anyone who knew you as you were has moved on. I'm sorry that you have to hear it this way. My little brother... well, we do our parts in our own time to keep this from happening. Sometimes, he needs a hand. 
If at once there's a beginning, then there must be an end. Love, I know you've been through your own ending, but it wasn't his. Now, what I have to do with your story is stark and cold.  What they don't tell you is that the ending... Has to end. And in your case, it's ended.
