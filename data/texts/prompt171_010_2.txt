"Hermann, it's for you. "Rudish Nlog Dyren blablabla..." whatsoever. He says, you have signed a contract, and that you are an 'overlord' now. I do believe this the moment, you take the garbage out, but I bet, these are your geezer friends. Tell these idiots to stop calling us. Hey Walt, is this you?"

...

"No. Okay. So, listen, honey, I will be honest this one time: My husband is not the brightest bulb in the ballroom. Have you tricked him into something? Because my son in law is a lawyer. A very good one, by the way. He will sue you right the moment, he is out of prison next week, if you have done something shady to Hermann, alright? Do you understand me?"

...

"OK. Where did he sign the contract?"

...

"In the bottom right corner? No, I meant: When did you meet him?"

...

"Never? But you are sure, you want to have him as a leader, because he bought your planet? What does this really mean?"

...

Well, I hope, you have all important businesses settled and no major conflict ahead. Just sayin'..."

...

"Yes, I try again: HERMANN, come right down, someone wants to talk to you! On the phone. It's long distance, and the clock is tickin', goddamn."

...

"Sorry. What? No, your grand leader is still away, making important business."

...

"Hm? Yes, he is an overall nice guy, just a little bit out of focus sometimes, as of right now, for example: HERMANN, for the last time, stop hiding in the toilet. Come down and answer the phone. Sorry, he still busy. Do we have to pay something? A fee in advance, processing costs, anything...?"

...

"No? OK, sweetheart, that's good. Does he need new clothes? I mean, he has some, but they are not very... prestigious."

...

"Hm, aha, I see, not a problem..., well, that's obviously an advantage. Do you pick him up? Because our fly-o-tron has been to maintanence last week, and I don't want to have any horrendous costs soon, because Mr. "I bought planet, but didn't tell anybody" is traveling halfway across the universe. Where is it by the way?"

...

"Never heard. Is it nice?"

...

"OK, we see. Do you have a reasonable infrastructure? Are you familiar with the concept of trading? Shops?"

...

"Uhum, yes... OK, one last question, just between you and me: Can he get paid out? Just asking."

...

"No? That's bad. Ah, he's coming. Well, maybe we see us sometime. Don't get to hard down on him. Cheers, sweety... Here, Herrman, I exchange the speaker for the debit-o-card. I'm downtown with the girls. And: Don't forget the garbage, 'overlord'."
