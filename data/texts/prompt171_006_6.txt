 ".....sold?" inquired Alien 223. The humans hadn't quite yet mastered the complexities of Xihuj language and relied on a number system to decipher who they were communicating with at any given time. Eddie used the most complicated mathematical manuvers he could come up with in the hopes that the aliens wouldn't be offended by simply counting them off one by one. Alien 223 was generally regarded as the leader, although it was difficult to see exactly how their hierarchy structure worked. It seemed as though various aliens would take turns acting on behalf of their civilization simply based on who was nearest the radio phone at the time. Eddie had spent half a day inquiring for an authority figure before giving up in the trust that his messages would be given to the appropriate alien. 

"Yes, sold. In our world we have a way of trading goods and services for pieces of paper called money. That way everyone doesn't have to do everything. Some people can be just doctors and then use money to buy food from a farmer, buy a house from a bank,  buy clothes from a, uh, clothing factory. There are some companies that find stars in the sky and sell them to people. They're usually bought and given as a gift to children or romantic interests so they can say they have a star named after them."

"Ah. And what is the name you have given to our star?"

"Well we just call your star Stellar 9013 but if you're asking for the name of the man who bought naming rights, I'm not sure. I could look it up if you're really interested."

"Yes, yes. We are MOST interested."
