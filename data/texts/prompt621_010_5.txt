"Damn dude...this game sucks...you want to go see Suicide Squad?" 
My friend nods in mutual agreement. I sit down the controller and head to the car. As my friend Jeff and I drive to the movie theater we continue to talk about No Man's Sky. My friend was originally going to buy the game that evening and we were going to have a killer time playing multiplayer and finding planets, the only problem is that there is no multiplayer.
"Damn dude...that movie sucked. I'm just going to give up and go to sleep, maybe tomorrow won't be such a let down." I say to my friend as I drop him off at his house.

When I get home, I crawl into bed, throughly disappointed in all the money I wasted that day.

I wake up to my bedroom full of U.S. Army generals and NASA specialists standing around my bed. "Brian Murphy?" one of the bigger military men says in an unsure voice. I still wiping the sleep out of my eyes in disbelief of what is actually happening. "Are you the Brian Murphy that has been playing No Man's Sky for the past 20 hours?" I look over at my Playstation and see that it's still on. "Uh...I guess" I say back to the man. "Good, we have a special mission for you. We need to discover the center of the universe." It's the last thing I hear him say before a bag is thrown over my head and I'm knocked unconscious.

I wake up in a ship that looks exactly like that garbage from No Man's Sky. "Alright Brian, prepare for takeoff." I hear through my headset. "B-but but what do I do? How to I fly this thing." It's too late to ask questions now, the ship has already taken off. "Don't worry the controller is in front of you, it's EXACTLY like the game. Do you copy?"
Silence.
"Brian...?"
Silence. Suddenly the radar blip disappears from the mission control screen.
"Sir, I think we lost him."

"Dammit, he was our only hope..."
