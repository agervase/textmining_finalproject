How does one 'accidentally' become a Dark Lord of evil?

Inheritance is one possibility, natural talent is another... and it turns out, by marriage. Lilith, ever so creatively named by her father, was the only daughter of Zhaggarath the Undying, Ever-chosen Lord of the Dead.

I knew something very few knew. Zhaggarath's was actually born one Timothy Moore, a peasants son in a hovel. And he was definitely not undying, I knew that as I looked at his corpse, his daughter weeping into my chest as I sat there wondering what the fuck. Undead Legions waited for their masters commands, the semi-sapient Wights in command desperate for the heir to be crowned. 

Married to Lilith for six months now I was faced with a problem I could not escape, legally or otherwise. By the laws Zhaggarath laid down, Lilith could not claim the throne. And worse, the old bat-king had written and entrusted a will and testament to his chamberlain, a Vampire so corpulent he sweat blood after a meal. 

The fucker had named me heir. 

*Get yourself a goth chick*. I had said to myself, what could possibly go wrong? I hadn't even realized that Lilith *was* the Necromancer's daughter, I had met her at a club said to be frequented by the more gothically inclined, she'd rescued me from a somewhat clingy zombie chick who seemed more interested in eating my manhood than my brains. 

And to impress her i'd enrolled in the Necromantic colleges myself, after seven years we'd wed... and only then had I learned who her father really was, and just about shat a homonculi onto the carpet in surprise, thankfully the turtlehead retreated back from whence it came sparing me soiling myself at my own wedding.

The Chamberlain passed me another note.

**DNR.**

**Do Not Resurrect.**

Undying my ass. The funeral, for a dark lord, was surprisingly quick, a few words to some demon or other from the funeral director, and then his body was tossed into a furnace while a dragon was coaxed to put a little more effort into getting it up to temperature.

And yet, for the next two weeks life settled into a sort of routine as we headed towards my coronation, the accounting-Liches went out with escorts to take stock of the Empire and tell me how many living or reanimated remained as others briefed me on the programs and educated me in statecraft. 

And yet, I did, because I loved that crazy bitch I married. 

And why do I persist?

She asked me once, what I would give her as a present for my coronation as Dark Lord of the realm.

My answer was simple.

Perhaps the same one Tim made.
