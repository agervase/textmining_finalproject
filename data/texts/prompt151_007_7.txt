"I'm telling you, man, you have to go to the *other* Sainsbury's"

"I have!  I went and I looked and it looks the same as the one you have but it just doesn't spread as well."

"You're not getting the right one.  Get the unsalted, it comes in the blue packaging you can get it in half-pound sticks.  I don't know how you ever got a job if you're this bad at following directions."

"I have the damn thing right here I swear it's the same.  The packaging is blue and it says 'Unsalted' right on the front.  You must just be getting lucky or something."

"No way.  I've been getting my butter from this same exact Sainsbury's ever since I moved into this place like three years ago.  Smooth, soft, spreads *effortless* even from fucking frozen.  I don't know what they put in it but I absolutely swear by them.  Wouldn't get my butter anywhere else"

"That's not what it's like for me.  It's just seems like normal butter."

"Are you looking in the right place?  It's in the dairy fridge under that weird health yogurt Sandra's always talking about.  You have to look for the blue-"

"Yeah dude the blue sticks I know where to find butter at fucking Sainsbury's and I'm telling you it's not the same.  Are you sure you don't put something in it?"

"Straight from the package no problem.  Best toast you've ever had.  Do you need me to go with you and help you find it?"

"Man fuck you.  Next time I'm around your place I'm going to steal your butter."

"Ha.  If you say so."

George hung up the phone.  I don't know how that man gets through his life when he's barely capable of shopping properly.  I wonder if there's any bread left, I could really go for some toast.
