I grew up in awe of the legends of that man, the most brutal servant of justice in my time.  No one I knew had ever seen him, yet his presence reverberated throughout the world. He was ferocious, and unseen beast.  If there was even a chance you were related to trouble, you were dead… and he never left a trace. 


After a while crime just stopped in the streets. The unknown power enforced the law, and we had no choice.  No one knows when he eventually passed. We were all too afraid to test the waters.  He was my inspiration to be honest with you, and it turned my world around when we eventually realized he was gone. Before the accident, I had every intention of living my life just as he had. I traveled the world to learn how to become the same invisible force. Of course, I took it too far, but that’s a story for another day if I live to tell the tale.  


Now I’m a long way from Brooklyn, yet there he was right in front of me. The aura of the building changed instantaneously and I was immediately reminded of home. I had never seen him before, and I wasn’t impressed. I almost didn’t believe it, but I could tell there was something off. The spell was intended for the Minor beside him, but this magick has a will of its own. Not a second after I finished my incantation did his eyes pierce into mine, still gleaming with recognition after all these years. I never even knew that he watched me, but I should’ve known that he watched us all. 


I made the mistake for just a second to think that this old man could do me no harm, but judging by the state of this place, I know now that I’m fucked.
