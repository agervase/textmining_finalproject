'I....died?'


'Yes my son.'


'F*ck.... Huh? I can't curse?'


'Yes my son.'


'Annnd you're god?'


'Yes my son.'

His voice came from everywhere. It echoed it my head. Everything around me was a perfect black. Not the kind of black where you close your eyes but the light still shines through your eyelids. This was pure darkness.


'Am I going to Hell?'


'Yes my son. Most likely. You are in purgatory and awaiting judgment. Since you did not repent your sins in life you are most likely going to hell, unless you've lived a sin free life. Which most do not.'

Thoughts race through my head about how unfair this system is and how little evidence for God's existence as well as every other argument I've ever heard about how stupid Christianity is. I try to formulate all of these into a logical argument. Just as I'm about to speak God cuts me off.


'Silence child. I know what you're going to say. The afterlife is not fair but everyone is subject to that same unfairness. This is just how it is.'


I hear a loud ding. Similar to a 1940s kitchen timer.


'You're judgment is complete child. As expected your fate is eternal damnation.'

Before I have time to process the levity of the situation, I hear a new voice this one with a very thick Indian Accent.


'Hold it right there! Yaweh if you give that soul to me I will give you 200 christened souls via wire transfer.'

'Deal!' Yaweh said without much hesitation. Suddenly I was transported to the 1920s wallstreet stock exchange. Or at least that's what it looked like. A man with blue skin and a huge man bun approached me.


'Hello my friend and welcome to the soul exchange!'

Part 2 in the works.
