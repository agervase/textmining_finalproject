July 15th:
I see the Ministry's official come closer. It was annoying that he has to come when I am so close to the truth. I just found a new species of creature and it was imperative the world knew. But those meddling authorities...they found a way to track my work. I guess I won't be able to continue my research.

July 17th:
I'm setting off to try and find a magical creature. I'd never done this before, so it should be easy. No idea what I wrote here 2 days ago, must be my vivid imagination. Will record my findings here.

July 21st:
Found a new type of organism. It can wield magic and it possesses a large amount of power too. Oddly enough it hasn't been found yet, so I'm in for some profit and fame with the discovery. That's always appreciated.

July 23rd:
Finally! My daughter's going to Hogwarts! As a muggle this is huge for me, since I'm an impotent spellcaster. Hopefully she does well. Fingers crossed for you, Hermoine!

July 28th:
I've found a rather interesting boy that Hermoine met. His name's Harry Potter, a rather bright young chap. Just the sort I favor. I showed him the new creature I'd found, and he seemed rather perturbed. I don't know why, it seemed fine to me.

July 31st:
The creature escaped. Damn it.

August 2nd:
Just went to Hogwarts for a meeting and apparently everyone knows me? That's really odd, since none of my works have ever made it to the major newspapers. But here everyone seems to be familiar with me and my 'discoveries'. Don't know what they are referring to.

August 14th:
I've just met with that Potter boy, and he says the creature I'd seen had some really weird magical tendencies. I can't really place it, but-

I turned around as I wrote my last diary entry, to see a face I found rather familiar. It was...oh yes! The creature I'd let go. Except it'd grown far bigger. And it was wielding an odd stick.

"Mr Granger, I think I need to have a word with you," it said, calmly, yet there was a dangerous undertone in his voice.

"You? Why?" I asked, fear rising within me. "Who are you, anyways?"

"You can call me 'Voldemort'," it said, its smile widening. "Come, come. We don't have all day."
