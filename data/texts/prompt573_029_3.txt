Love//Life ~ Head's up - The first part sounds really awkward and weird to setup. Please help me lol

After living for what feels like an eternity, it feels like heaven to be able to die. Especially when the reaper is the woman of your dreams. Her red eyes stared at me every time I walked through the gates of hell, with a slight hint of despair. But even walking through them, her room always seemed to comfortable for the both of us. I never wanted to leave. Even though she made me flip the coin of choice every time. The black strands of her hair trickled down towards her perky breasts that seemed to defy gravity. Then again, there's no **real** gravity in hell, is there? Red and Black dresses appeared to be her uniform of choice. The tight material ran close to her body, with her legs that loved to show from the long cuts on the sides. Rarely did she ever wear panties with me, but when she did, her lips began to touch mine in a dance of death. What greeting was this, in a place of death. Such a "Warm Welcome."

After a few lifetimes, I began to know her more personally. Her lifetime was one of a lone wolf. She began as a Chinese girl by the name of Ling. Soon after she was born, her parents left her to the buddhist temple, where she studied her life to become a martial artist. Her fame renounced across the world, as the best female killer known to man.

Killer in life, killer out of life too. What a coincidence.

"Hey babe, time to try again?" Ling said.

"I would, but I love you too much to do so."

"Aww, but it's fun, honeyâ€¦ I love playing games with you. <3"

"You know, Ling. Your eyes always seemed to allure me. I wonder if they were different in your lifetime."

"How come you always ask about my lifetime? Victor, you never tell me about your stories anymore. It's been 72 times already."

"My lives aren't fun anymore. They're agonizing. Every person I have become, every human I try and live by, I always lose. Their work is so much harder than the next person's, and nobody understands each other's struggles anymore. I have given up on humanity."

Ling's eyes traveled away from mine. For once, I showed her that I was able to understand what everybody goes through. She began to cry. Her tears were little diamonds that I never wanted to see, and I told her. She cried every time I began another lifetime, but this time, she saw who I really was. Her bed caught her body ever so softly, with the quietest of landings. 

"Victor, you need to leave. NOW," she said, trying not to let her voice break.

"Ling, I've learned to love you. Please don't make me leave."

"You know you have to go anyways. Just go now. Save me the trouble. Forget the game. This lifetime is on me," she sobbed."

"I don't want to leave you."

"Go!"

"NO," I screamed. I felt as if hell had risen the heat with her emotion. Her face turned red hot, as she walked at me with a dagger, curved and ready for my heart.

Quickly. Dodge left. Grab her hand. Disarm. Twist. Spin her around. Kiss.

After a few moments, she flinched back, and looked at me with the loving eyes I had always wanted from her. The ones that didn't push me away, the eyes that didn't just use me for pleasure.

"Victor, I don't know how. You can't stay. The rules don't work that way."

"You need to calm down."

"I can't. You know how I got this way. I don't have power over myself anymore. I work for the universe. You can still chose your lifetime. Go back and redo it. I am nothing."

"Then send me back to your lifetime. So I can find you, and change this."

Her body froze. She had never heard a request made out of love for her. What was this new feeling that she had gained? Who was really Victor, and why did he love her so much? She was nothing but a murderer. But he forgave her and gave her happiness in the darkest of times.

"Babe, let me go then. Let me change **us**," I explained. Her eyes looked at mine for the final time. The black dust began to spin around me. It has never happened this way before. 

The coin was in my hand. Through natural reflexes, it sat right against the crook of my index finger, my thumb supporting it underneath it. This was the last time I would ever flip this coin again. The last time it would come to me.

"Hey. I love you. I'll never forget you."

"I love you too. Save me. Save us. Don't forget about me either., Victor. I will always love you."

The coin sprang up from my hand, rotating at a speed that made the metallic finish sparkle and flash before our eyes. There was this feeling that I never could have imagined. Everything was perfect. We closed our eyes. This was the last time I would ever go back to humanity, in the sight of love. My world flashed around me, faded out to white, and the last thing I ever said to her became the saying I would use to find her again.

"Head's up."
