On mobile... But here goes.

I was suprised. One moment i was drinking Jameson at an Irish wake for my to soon departed friend Amy, the next second I'm staring at a white skeleton with maggots falling from the eyesockets. A devilishly good looking woman seated to the left. And Amy, my Amy is seated to my right. 

The woman starts to speak again, something about games. I'm hardly paying attention because did that skeleton just move! 

Stop please!, i shout. None of this makes any sense. I must be dreaming i mumble to myself. A dry whisper, like dead leaves reaches my ears. I assure you that you are not. This is all to real. Amy wished for the person who cared the most about her to help her play a game with the devil and death.

Game? Death? Devil! Amy! 

I don't understand i stammer... 

Death just be quite the gorgeous woman admonished. It's quite simple John, we are going to play a game you two verse us. If you win the gam

Wait! I shout as i cut her off mid sentence. How can we play a game fairly against you two when you have other worldly powers? Are you just allowed to cheat, i hardly see the point in a game if the two of you can cheat using other worldly powers? Also, if we play a game. What about a tie? 

Ahh, mortals such varied responses and questions, replied the devil. It's preposterous to think that death could beat me in the first place. In all this time I've always been first in all the games. But yes a tie would go to the mortals. As for powers, we are only allowed to use our physical bodies and experienced minds. No tricks here.

And it's you two verse me and Amy? In a game of our choosing?
