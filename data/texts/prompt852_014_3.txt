I lived on the cusp of desolation, now a distant memory. 

Green farmlands prosper, their soil fertile with bountiful pastures and fruits. Cities hold the wilds at bay with their large walls, beckoning peace and safety inside their fortresses. The beasts of the night that had plagued us for generations past are no more than tales to frighten children into behaving for their parents.  
  
All of this because of a tyrant who looked upon the eons of suffering and stood his ground; his fortitude resolved, his mind set. He had fallen to enough sorrows and failures. No more.  
  
**All of this because of me.**  

My will to act saved our lives, at the cost of only ten. Sacred blood coursed through our veins, all originating from the Spawn of Creation- the man who staved off desolation the first time. His followers were our forefathers- their gifts passed down to us. With us we had the powers of gods, master of our own domains. Master generals of combat, control over the oceans around us, beings of wisdom and strength. Each led or advised generations to prosperity, and for a time led peace.  
  
But all things must come to an end. And the same blood that coursed through our veins became our undoing- our stench compelled the damned beasts to rise from their ashes and strike, again and again, century after century, destroying our progress. We always managed to survive total destruction, but at terrible prices of human life.  
  
But our bloodlines were greedy, and could not see the truth of their own bodies strength. Our lives should be forfeit, our lines ended, our powers lost to the sands of time. But they never dared to do what was right.  
  
  
**So I acted for them.**
  
I was not the strongest of them all. I was not the wisest of them all. I had neither their grace nor their intellect, their mastery over the physical domain, the civilizations they led. My blood was a quiet one, locked away to the edge of the world, researchers and practitioners of the forsaken and the damned.  
But my one advantage was my will to act where no one else would.  
  
One by one, the gods of the world fell. Their people suffered for a time- their lands lost their luster, their walls stopped standing as high, their wars turned tides. But they rebuilt, and they survived off their own merit alone.   
  
And with every death, Oblivion itself faltered back, their motivation a distant memory. The stench faded, until only three remained. The worlds people prospered again- not as strong as they had once before, but with the potential to grow unheeded by their benevolent overlords. 
  
My blood ran last, its cold feel under my skin reminding me of my ultimate task set in front of me. I had married once, and brought progeny to this world. Progeny that coursed with bane of civilization, innocent children who knew only happiness, of a bright smile to light their fathers day.  
  
The will to act faltered, as did the world before it. The beasts ran rampant again. The civilizations fell to ruin, the last bastions of humanity falling before my very eyes. I had the power to stop this. I had already come so close, only three remained. My son, my daughter, myself.  
  
But I would not act for them.  
  
I leave this letter for you, my son. My daughter, heed your fathers last request. He was not strong enough to do what had to be done, only taking the number down to two.  
  
I leave it in your judgement to finish the work, or to find a new path. If anyone could, I know it to be you two.  
  
Love  
The Tyrant
