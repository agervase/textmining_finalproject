They call it The Library.Its a planet that has every book that ever existed, printed and digitalized just for this planet.

Every now and then, 100 minds are chosen from random planets to experience this wonder.In one night these people can read one year's worth of books.I've been coming here for nearly nine years.At first it was great because I could read books that were yet to be printed or books that were ancient.Eventually it got boring as I realized that I would be coming here every time I dream.Physically I am nine but mentally I am thousands of years old.So old that I've read every book here at least twice.So now when I come here I talk with the A.I helpers and anyone else who was chosen to visit.Recently though I've noticed that the people in the current group are going missing with no traces.I assume that they got lost somewhere.

A few relative days later I got out of that room to get myself a drink.I went to the cafeteria and turned on the lights when suddenly the lights went out.I didn't want to believe that the Vashta Nerada where here so I decided to ask out loud
