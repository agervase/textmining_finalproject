*Watch out for those humans, Greg. They can hear you.*

*That's just an urban legend, Samantha.* Greg signed, swaying and tapping his tail on her back as they scurried in search of food. *There's no such thing as hearing. Honestly, do you believe everything they teach you at the Academy?* Greg asked smugly once they settled on the kitchen table. *Next you're going to tell me mountains are real.*

Samantha grimaced. *I'll never get over how the Church calls facts 'urban legends'.*

*Let's not talk about your lack of faith during breakfast, please.* Greg signed as he feasted on Earthly cheese. *It pains me to think about how you won't join me in paradise.*

Samantha's red eyes urged caution. *Please, Greg. Maybe we shouldn't eat so close to the humans?*

*You're being ridiculous. It's dark in here AND the humans are in another room entirely!* Greg signed exasperatedly. *We have four walls around us, so they can't see us, smell us, touch us, or taste us!*

*But what if sound is real? What if you're really loud when you eat? What if they actually can hear that? We won't even know if they approach us until it's too late.*

*Stop it, Samantha. That's crazy talk.* Greg looked flustered. *Earth is the number one destination for Arraytees!*

*But--*

*Jesus, Samantha, if you think Earth is so awful, why did you even agree to come?*

Samantha puffed. *Because you wouldn't stop fucking talking about Earth cheese. Honestly, I can't wait until we get back home tomorrow.*

Greg turned away abashed. *About that... there's something I have to tell you...*

Samantha stomach flipped in anticipation.

*I only bought us one way tickets to Earth.*

Samantha felt herself fall apart. *What?*

*Honestly, it was all I could afford but listen--*

*How could you do this to me? To us?* They were doomed, she thought. Trapped on this planet with monsters indefinitely. How long could they avoid their demise?

*Would you have come here with me otherwise? You and the kids? Samantha, please. Isn't it worth getting away from the recession?*

*Oh my God, Greg. Algernon is only a baby!*

*In human years, maybe.* Greg scoffed. *In Arraytee years--.*

Their fates were sealed, she knew. Her babies. Samantha wailed. She wrapped her tail around herself and rocked back and forth, turning away from Greg.

*Oh, please stop crying.* This makes a noise, Greg couldn't help but think. Damn compulsory Arraytee Academy education. *Samanth--*

WHACK! A frying pan slammed Samantha, killing her immediately. Greg looked on horrified. He looked up, and saw the human. They look so much bigger up close. This human could be as big as 5 feet, he thought to himself, and still, he had child-like features. Greg was terrified.

The human readied the frying pan again, that psychopathic monster, but by then Greg had already dashed away, into his hole, mourning the loss of his faith.
