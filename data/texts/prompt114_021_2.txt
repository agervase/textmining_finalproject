I know everyone’s name. I don’t know how I do. I just do. I suppose it’s a little creepy. It’s not like their name is written above their head and I read it, it’s more of a feeling. It’s never been wrong. I look at a person, their warmth or coldness in a spectrum of colors, sinks into my skin. Sometimes a particular person can leave my body warm and cozy for a whole day and I can think of them and smile happily to myself. But other times, it can be sticky and I can almost see thick tar wrapping around my feet making its way up the curve of my back.

Mummy’s told me I must keep this feeling a secret. “People will think you’re following them and people don’t like to be followed.” She said sternly. One time, when I was eight, I forgot to keep this little secret that Mummy and I had. 

&#x200B;

I saw this girl skipping on rocks by the stream.  She had faded blue overalls on with a plaid sweater around her waist and long neck dinosaurs on her socks. Her brown pigtails bounced up and down with each little skip. She reminded me of a daisy or a spring finch. Warm yellows, grass green, and sky blues swelled around her. She was an Amanda! 

&#x200B;

I ran down the hill to the little stream. “‘Manda! ‘Manda!” I called out! I wanted to be her friend so bad! She swiveled around on her rock on the tips of her toes, hands flailing, fear struck her eyes and the little spring finch was gone. 

&#x200B;

That day I had learned my lesson. As I matured from a boy into a man, I kept my secret and on fanciful days it was nothing more than a good party trick. I’d sit at the bar, sheeply, with Brian and he’d say slyly to a pretty lady, “I bet’chu he can guess your name.” “Is that right?” She’d say amused, rolling her eyes. “Yes! If he guesses your name, you have to let us buy you a drink!” His selection, though pretty, weren’t very good. Some girls emitted a mucky green, purple, and brown sludge and I’d purposefully guessed wrong. Others were like grey static. When he chose girls with a dreary, melodic watercolor essence, I’d learn over putting my hand on her shoulder and tell her she ought to go home and take a rest. I’d go home alone to my small studio apartment. The days felt longer and the people around me seemed to grow colder and colder as the years went by, jarred by monochromatic static and woeful streaks. Sometimes, as I lay next to the sleeping blur of a woman next to me, Eve, huh, ironic, I wondered what frequency I was… but in my heart, I already knew, for the day by the creek was the last day I really felt warm. 

&#x200B;

Eve came and went. So did Clare, Amy, Tiffany, and Sam. Each day came and went. Wash, eat, go to work, design adverts, eat, drink, and sleep. Utter monotonous. Fuck grocery shopping. Nothing makes you feel worse about the prospects of humanity than grocery shopping. The piss yellow walls, blue humming lights, and mildly infuriating aisle that were never quite straight. I hated the systematic trudging down each lane like a fucking sheep praying there wasn’t an obnoxious neighbor or ex lurking like a wolf around the corner. Worse were the little old ladies emitting skinny, straggly yellow and pink electrocuted lines, wiggling all over the place, and asking you if you could help her find the green beans and you’d have to patiently impatiently explain to her she was in the cleaning and dog shit aisle and canned goods were 3 rows over.

&#x200B;

“That’s kind, what you did for her.”

&#x200B;

“What?” I said as I whirled around. 

&#x200B;

I stopped. I pressed my eyelids hard together twice. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Warm yellows, grass green, and sky blues swelled all around her and a warmth so radiant, the act of turning your back away would have felt frigged. 

&#x200B;

“Amanda?” I asked, bewildered. “My god, Amanda! I thought you died! Tha-that day by the stream… what happened?” 

&#x200B;

“…I’m sorry…” She said slowly, “I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person. I never was in a stream… but… no…”

&#x200B;

“What? What is it? You must be Amanda!” I exclaimed.

&#x200B;

“No. Nothing. I’ve got to get going. Nice meeting you.”

&#x200B;

“Wait!” I cried, chasing after her with my cart, its wheels uncooperatively swerving far left and then far right again. 

&#x200B;

“SIR! SIR! STOP!” The cashier grabbed my shoulder. I abandoned the cart. 

&#x200B;

“Amanda! Wait! Stop!” 

&#x200B;

She whirled around, “Stop calling me Amanda! My name’s not Amanda! You’ve got the wrong person. “No…It must be Amanda” I whisper more to myself than anything, “…I’m never wrong.” I notice tears streaming down her eyes. “I’m sorry to offend you… I didn’t mean to… I just got so exci…” She’s turned away from me with her arm stretched out, hand on the roof of her car. 

&#x200B;

“No… I… I don’t understand. I-i-i have memories, memories that aren’t mine. They can’t be mine. Memories of a stream… memories of brick buildings from… another time… and gentle voices cooing and calling me… Amanda… but they can’t be real. They can’t. My name’s not…” 

&#x200B;

She paused.

&#x200B;

“… Who… are… you?”  

&#x200B;

“My name’s Billy”

&#x200B;

“… but WHO are you?”

&#x200B;

“My name’s Billy. I was born on a planet Tralfamadore and I’ve been unstuck… in time.”
