"Hey, Kyle."

"Hey, Doug, how's it going?"

"Not much, man. You?"

"Uh...not much, not much." I looked at him closely, but Doug didn't notice; he was busy digging into a tuna sandwich. "Classes go alright?"

"None today, so it went excellently." He laughed at his own bad joke. A desperately forced laugh, I thought. "You just came back from calc?"

"Yeah. This stuff is hard; all of it just goes over my head," I complained.

"Really? Thought it would be simple for you; you're like a math genius, aren't you?"

"What? Who told you that?" I snapped, and then strained to even out my temper. "I mean, I'm a genius at nothing. Just trying to get by." I yawned, hopefully convincingly.

"Tired, huh? I noticed you were up late last night."

I widened my eyes, but kept my voice steady. "Yeah, uh...lot of work to do. Midterms coming up, y'know. Hey, I gotta get this phone call, talk to you in a bit." I waved my phone screen at him briefly before running out of the dorm.

"Something to report?"

"It's my roommate again, sir," I whispered, phone glued to my ear. "I really think he *knows*. I mean, he's good at pretending, but I think--"

"Kylixiixo-12, don't be an idiot," the gruff voice in my ear intoned. "You're paying the rent and bills, and you've become fluent in their guttural, meat-flap language. He knows nothing. Just focus on your mission. Speaking of which..."

I groaned inwardly but nodded. Stupid Earth habit I couldn't shake off. "Don't worry, sir. I've already initiated Phase 1. I put the nanobot bolus into his tuna sandwich."

"Excellent. Frankly, I don't understand why you're so concerned - it won't matter in a few days; he will be under our control soon."

"And once this preliminary test is complete, all of humanity shall follow."
