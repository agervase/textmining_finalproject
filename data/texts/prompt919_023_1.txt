SCENE: Throne room of a huge castle. Sunset. Enter the QUEEN.]

QUEEN:
I'd ask the gods for guidance and for help, 
If not those gods did torment me themselves! 
The bargain I have made can't be unmade - 
But they request it be fulfilled today!
My heart can't take it. 

I'd contest their demand, but I'm afraid 
Their wrath would but increase. - No, it must be. 
The hour is almost come.

[Enter LIVIUS, followed by his father, the KING.]

But what is this? My son, why art thou running 
From thine own father?

LIVIUS:
O Mother, thou wilt not believe what he-
This villanous and most foul specimen of a king-
hath told me ere two minutes ago! He said
That he had bargained with most fearsome creatures.
Those evil, godlike beings wrapped in darkness
Shall get hold of my soul and of my body
Before the sun goes down this very evening.
O mother, thou must help me!

KING:
The very thought of giving you away
It seems to rip my very heart in twain.
Forgive me. I have nothing more to say.

QUEEN:
If it were not as horrid, I would laugh.
I also gave away thy soul for power.

LIVIUS:
How can you jest at moments grave as this?
Abandon thy equivocating speech.

QUEEN:
T'is true. I swear upon my very life.

KING:
But how's it possible? Why would those gods
Accept our firstborn son from you when I
Already promised it to them before?

QUEEN:
It must've been different gods then, I'm afraid.
They promised me they'd make you marry me.

LIVIUS:
Is't true? My father and my mother too
Have given me away to evil gods
In exchange for power?

QUEEN:
You cannot fathom how it kills my heart
To say t'is true. Oh my, the sun's gone down -
And here they come. My son, you may hate me now
But know that I have loved you since your birth
And still do.

KING:
So do I.

LIVIUS:
No matter how much love you have for me,
I want none of it. There are no words
That could express the hate I have for you.
What good are years of loving parenting
If you both knew I would be ta'en away
Through your own fault?

[A portal appears. Enter FIENDISH GODS.]

FIENDISH GODS:
We have arrived.

[A crack in the ground appears. Enter DEMONIC GODS.]

But what is this? O Queen, what does this mean?
Wilt thou not keep thy promise? Give us the boy.

DEMONIC GODS:
A promise? King, we come to fetch your son.
You wear the crown, we have fulfilled our duty
But we require payment for our service.
The child, now. [To the FIENDS] Take your faces hence.

FIENDISH GODS:
The boy is ours. We will not give him up
To creatures like you. If you want him, take him.

[They fight.]

LIVIUS:
Not only have you forfeited my life,
But you have started war betwixt those gods!
[Drawing]If I must go to hell, then so shall you.

[Stabs KING and QUEEN. Then stabs himself.]

QUEEN and KING:
Forgive us, forgive us!

LIVIUS:
Maybe after an eternity has passed
I might consider it. Farewell.

[They all die.]
