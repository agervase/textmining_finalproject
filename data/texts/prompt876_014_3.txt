The Pearly Gates, you hear about them in stories of encounters with the afterlife, see them in ghosts, but nothing prepares for you seeing them, shattered into pieces lying on the ground. Looking around, I notice Saint Peter doesn't appear to be here, the gentle old man who guides those worthy into Heaven.

As I walk up to the remains of the gate, a squelching noise grabs my attention. Blood, not human blood, but lighter. Following the puddle of blood, I see Saint Peter, or what's left of him.

*What is going here?* I muse as I look around.

Stepping around the shattered gate, I walk up the cloudy path higher into Heaven. Normally I would drink in the glory of Heaven as I walked through, but all I can see is dead angels. I say a small prayer as I increase my pace.

Climbing higher, I can see one of the Archangels, Michael. His arm looks shattered, and his wings are torn and bloody. Then I see the body.

Him. God is dead. I rush up to Him, and kneel by his body.

He looks so peaceful, as He lay there. His face almost serene. I reach out to touch him.

**No!** A Voice boomed loudly.

Turning around, I can see Michael limping towards me, his holy sword pointed at me.

**You do not have the right to touch Him, after what you have done!** Michael roared.

"What are you going on about? I just got here from Earth." I retort in shock.

**No, this is your fault, God-Killer!** He yells as he swings his weapon.

The injuries Michael has suffered affects his swing, and I am able to duck it easily.

"I'd call you a liar, but well, you're Michael. Where are the other Archangels? Uriel, and the others?" I ask as Michael turns towards me.

**You killed them! You slaughtered my Brothers and Sisters along with my Father!** The blade comes roaring towards me again. I step out of the attack and back in after the blade whistles past.

Michael would normally have an aura of power, all the others did. But he is too injured it seems.

**Why did you do this? Why can't you leave us alone?** Michael roars.

The blade whistles at me head on, it would be easy to dodge, but it is obvious that Michael is too weak. I catch the blade effortlessly, and smile at Michael.

"Why? Because I could. Because it felt good killing your Father." I spat at Michael, grabbing the blade stopping Michael from pulling the blade back.

My grin as almost mocking now. With a twist of my wrist, I snap the top of the sword. Michael looks at me in shock.

**Why?** He whispers.

I walk up to him, and drive my fist through his chest, and pull him closer to me.

"Because I was bored of Heaven, but in truth, God has failed. And if you think this is bad, you should see what I did to Hell."
