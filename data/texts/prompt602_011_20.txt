### Humanity: Special For Exactly One Reason

#### They're the most absolutely full of themselves species in the entire universe.

Space is unimaginably vast.  This is a simple fact: from the puniest Rentinn to the most mighty Telonn, all species know of the terrible vastness of space and their comparatively minute presence within it.

Well, *almost* all species.  For the next 90 minutes, I'm going to introduce you to a plucky little species that thinks they're just the best thing since sliced bread, an invention they also think they made before anyone else did.

Yes, they believe this despite the universe having existed prior to their arrival for over 13 billion years.

Humans!

Let me tell you about a planet.  This planet has a mean surface temperature of 735K, has a *day* that's longer than its *year*, has an air pressure equivalent to nearly a kilometer underwater, and, oh yes, its atmosphere is made of sulfuric acid.

No, that's not Humanity's homeworld.  Humans live on the planet next from their star, and, despite knowing all of the above facts, believe that *their* world is some kind of hell-world.

Yes, the world with the beaches, the temperate (and abundant!) water, the seasons, and basically all of the conditions necessary for life in general and thus conditions that a great many of our species *also* enjoy on *our* homeworlds!  They think that's what makes up a hell-world.

Oh, it gets better.  Humans also believe the following:

* **Only Earth has predators!** Considering that competition for resources is literally the driving force behind evolution, this is not only short sighted but actively silly.  Intelligence tends to come as a result of improving one's predatory abilities and/or improving one's ability to escape from predation.

* **Only Earth has bad weather!** See above re: Venus.  Also, they have apparently never seen a Gas Giant before.  I imagine the helium-infused species watching this are finding this belief especially humorous, given their planets feature storms larger than Earth itself.

* **Only humans suffer from contagious disease!** This is actually true, but it's only because they haven't advanced enough to improve their immune systems.  I'm not sure why they think suffering from a cold gives them some kind of tactical advantage, but at this point this is hardly the most baffling thing.

In conclusion, if there's one thing to take away from this, it's that humankind is absolutely right about it being home to an unbearable hellscape, but it's not the planet that's at fault.  No, it's not the planet so much as the species itself that is insufferable.  Or, to use their own words:

"Hell is other people."
