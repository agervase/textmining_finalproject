He eyed the pile of pamphlets left by his daughter suspiciously. Every visit the stack left behind - and she was leaving stacks - seemed to grow larger and larger. The pamphlets contained material for different vacation spots abroad, medical procedures, and more and more often, *retirement homes.* It was like she was leaving them behind in silent communication, two complete contrasts that said, "listen, you know and I know, and *everyone knows* that you've had your time. Either you grace this family and disappear to some sunny spot far away, *or* you slip into a retirement home far away. We're not arguing with you anymore." 


He wasn't so senile or delusional that he didn't pick up on it *years* ago. Someone lives to be as old as he has learns to read the vibes through the seasons of life. It's not *his* fault he came from a time when people actually respected their elders, barely. He groaned as he tossed aside a pamphlet he'd been mindlessly flipping through for the 'SHAANTI RETIREMENT HOME,' which was complete with images of a sun-filled atrium and stocked full of people that looked *younger* than him but still old by societies standards, fixed with their plastic smiles as if to say they didn't mind the staff, clothed in all white, leering over them with their gaze of faked sincerity; the same staff that at night, when they tucked in the patrons, probably whispered in their ears, "so, have you *decided* yet?" 


Other pamphlets had equally obscure names, 'NEEND, WETASKIWIN, NIPA,' so on, so forth, each less pronounceable than the one before. Without aging really being a threat, and social pressure now taking precedence, the retirement industry has grown without end and, he suspected at least, has taken on less of a 'Shady Oaks Retirement Home' feel than a 'Send Your Old Away On An Iceburg' feel. Someplace to forget about the useless retired until the retired make the *decision* themselves. Sometimes he suspected that in some of these places they were encouraged to decide fairly quickly to make room for other business, though the lack of people *leaving* these places meant a lack of proper resources on the matter.


He glances of the old people and their plastic smiles again, like fixtures on a mannequin, someone controlling them with a hand up their ass. His problem, he would tell himself, *his* problem is that he isn't *like these people.* They *are* old, and he *is* old, but he is also *with it.* He held three Phds, one in business, one in environmental sciences, and one in anthropology respectivly. The consequence of to much time and money. He held a number of high-ranking positions in each of his fields until the unemployment bubble and the younger generations slowly but surely 'encouraged him' into retirement to make room for fresh blood. 


He would have been quite happy to keep on working forever, though the new burst in free time allotted to him a number of new experiences. At a ripe old age almost into the triple digits, he opened his mind where he had previously been unable to, exploring daily concoctions of pills, powders, tinctures, tonics, bases, herbs, sprays, watching as time fell into a blur of noise and color. When he was bored with that, he packed up and saw the outback of Alaska from a log-cabin he bought from a friend who had also *retired.* He had ambled through the busy cafes and old city streets of European cities, ate from food stalls in crowded allies in Southeast Asia. He'd seen Machu Pichu twice in his old age, climbed Everest once, learned Latin and Greek because he could, took up several instruments including guitar and brass, even learned to crochet - all this at an 'age' when the young are typically busy shuffling away their ancestors into retirement. All this done, he reflected with pride, at an age when most of those on the pamphlets were probably settling into their lives at the home.
