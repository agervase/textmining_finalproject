The rats!
ALL of the rats fled the sinking ship.

Our history writes, when those with the clear power of mind, politics and invention had the chance to stand up and be counted they ran as far and as fast as possible to avoid the slightest possibility of defeat. 

As we looked to the sky and saw the ships hovering we contemplated our fate, although it looked bleak it was down to us or them, and brother, you don’t come to earth and expect the human race to lay on its back! 

After the initial panic, our historians record, groups of people began to form rag tag societies and search for weaponry, anything to fight our potential invaders, but alas, it was all either taken or destroyed by the rats. 

Knowing little but an invasion was imminent the rag tag societies began to cooperate and world peace was actually quick to occur, unity amongst nations the likes of which hadn’t been possible because of the rats desire to hold onto power by any means and keep us divided, once our TRUE enslavers had gone we began to live in peace. 

On the day of the invasion, all communications and information about the aliens had been public and shared and a small group of representatives was chosen to meet them. 

The aliens told us they had been watching and holding back for centuries for our world to be at peace with itself before we could live at peace with the galactic community, and boy they hate the rats as much as we do, but in a way, we owe them thanks for leaving because the aliens shared their technology, helped rebuild the fallen cities and elevated the human race to the stars as a whole, NOT just a select group of selfish rats. 

Upon the rats return they begged us to rejoin earth, we, being an enlightened people agreed on one condition, they would be commoners, their wealth, status and “birth rights” removed they would live a life of comfortable obscurity working like everyone else, or they could be outcast to the farthest reaches of space, never to return.
