A business entity that can encompass all the other businesses and copy their strengths. My mind goes straight to a conclusion. It has to be the Chinese!!! Without further ado, I invoked the power of Google and booked the earliest cheapest flight the algorithm could find and started packing the bare necessities.

That, I kept reminiscing for the past few weeks. Hotel room strewn with packaging of instant dinners and instant noodles. I thought this was a 3 star hotel. The ratings were all good too. But then again, perhaps those were just fake scummy bots. Blast them. No one stole my stuff when I wasnt around thought so I'll just say so far Im happy in this foreign country.

Ive looked in all the major cities. Shanghai, Guangzhou, and even Beijing itself. Such a big economy, but such a pity. None was up to the challenge. In a stroke of luck, I met a big man at a big banquet. Bribed my way through the backdoor and the kitchen. Dont ask. These employees do not see sheepish at the slightest. Im happy they arent working with me.

Hidden among the shadows of these high profile crowds, I saw my target. This is it I guess. "Ni Hao" I said in my most awkward unrefined pronunciation. To be honest that was the only Mandarin word I know. Everywhere else on earth, I would instantly be deemed a racist to say that. However Jack Ma seems cool and understanding. His aides seem concerned, but surely not more concerned than I am. Before I can speak a word, this man as if by telepathy feels the situation and ushered me to a more quiet area. Such intuition, such abilities. This has to be "The Avatar" no doubt about it. Thus, I explain the situation.

Jack Ma seems unchanged. I couldnt tell from his expression whether he knows everything already, or he doesnt really care. "Many have come before. Say same thing to me. This is the struggle for the west. I am sorry to hear about this but... in the end this not my fight". So I guess it seems to me he doesnt really care I guess. To not waste anymore of his time I said my thanks and left. This time through the front entrance. Very nice carpets, vases, and ornaments. I turned back to grab a drink (yay free drinks) and finally exited the compound for good.

And from there I walked aimlessly throughout the cold bitter night. If hope is on sale Id order one for same day delivery. I definitely need to clear my thoughts and towards the left I saw a park and a bench so I just sat there thinking of what next to do. I hear a car stop by and the driver came out and from the footsteps I hear the person is definitely walking in my direction. This is it I guess. This is where I get a bag over my head and thrown in a drum with cement by the Yakuza. Wait. Thats Japan. So I turned around and saw some thin Asian man. "Mr Ma sends his regards. He says he knows where you need to find The Avatar". With that he passed me a card with a contact and some code word scribbled on the back and went off.

Oh boy, the ol wild goose chase all over again.

Long story short I finally get to meet the man. But what he said I will not forget "Colonization of new planets, starting with Mars, is crucial to the survival of the human species", and then he went on some stories of his plans about sending some goddamn car on a rocket to orbit around Mars. Im done man.

You know what they say. If you cant beat them. Join them. So I asked Siri to go to Amazon and buy me a house to be sent by drone and drop it on my backyard. Too bad I didnt have enough money for that. So I lost the house, my job, everything.

So thats my story. Now give me some change dude *shakes plastic cup with a few coins inside*

THE END
