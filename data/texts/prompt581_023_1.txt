The latch hisses shut closing me off from the world. It’s quiet. It makes sense, but I didn’t expect that. I can see the lab techs moving around, calling out numbers and system checks but I can’t hear them. Then, all too quickly, the chamber fills with cold air. My suit protects me from the brunt of it, but my face tightens up and the frost in my breaths temporarily clouds my view.

Ten feet out from the chamber, I can see Jimmy, or Dr. James A. Orien, rather. Today is the culmination of his life’s work but he still can’t find the time to crack a smile. He scans the room and pauses briefly on me. All I get is a nod, but it’d be unfair to expect more from him. Just behind him, Mary’s making sure my vitals and life support are all green. I can see the worry lines from here. If it weren’t for Jimmy’s breakthrough, Mary and I would be on a beach somewhere, trying for baby number one. But then again, life hasn’t always gone our way.

The chamber hums to life as all the panels go green. Jimmy and Mary have already talked me through this. The machine slowly hums to life as each system comes online. I can see the two of them going through the checklists outside. Mary’s trying to stay calm, but I can see the faintest tremble in her stance. And Jimmy-

KACHUNK!

The machine lurches and in an instant the chamber isn’t green anymore, it’s blood red. The machine rattles as support systems go offline. My mouth goes dry when I look outside and see Mary’s face panic. The facility flies into chaos and techs rush from one station to another and people shout updates to one another. The silent chamber isn’t cold anymore, it’s burning hot. I can feel the skin on my face edge on blistering as the machine’s hum turns into a scream.

The heat grows hotter and hotter until… it’s gone. My ears are ringing from the piercing shriek when I realize I’m not in the chamber. I’m in the backyard of my parents’ first home. Jimmy’s on the swing set with mom and I’m playing catch with dad. His face frowns when I pause during our game and he-

-grips onto the handlebars. Dad’s got a grim look on his face while Jimmy’s head flies back laughing. His first roller coaster and our last trip just before Jimmy joins me in high school. In about three months, Jimmy’ll introduce me to a girl his Algebra class. Her name’s Mary and I-

-fall to my knees. I can feel hot tears run down my face while Mary does her best to comfort me. Jimmy just stands there, staring at our parents graves. We hadn’t been on the best terms since everything with Mary and ever since the accident, he hasn’t spoken a word. He turns to me and nods. I reach out and-

-crash onto the floor. I barely got the latch open. My fingers burn from where they held the steel handlebars and I can barely make out Mary’s face as she rushes over to me. Jimmy stands, mouth agape as Mary takes my vitals. She wants me to move, but I can’t. My body’s too heavy and… And I realize, I can’t hear her. I can’t hear anything. I touch my ears and I can feel the blood dripping out of them. It starts as a low hum but within seconds, it’s the same piercing shriek. I take a deep breath and-

-try not to hit Jimmy. I’ve been working as a fry cook for months to pay for his tuition and now he’s telling me wants to drop out. At least, I think he is. His annoyingly calm face is moving but nothing comes out. I’ll tell him we can’t afford to buy him a car, but he’ll just open a credit card in my name and buy one anyway. I lean over and-

-carry Mary over the threshold. God she looks beautiful. I know she’s telling me she loves me, but I can’t hear her. I don’t know how long this’ll last so I stop moving and just hold her. She smiles, but I can see she’s a little worried. It doesn’t matter because in a few seconds, I won’t be-

It’s two months earlier. Mary and Jimmy have been working on a new project: time travel. After years of silence, Jimmy walked back into our lives and offered Mary a job. Six years of meetings, research, and funding and finally Jimmy has a breakthrough. They’re asking me to join their project as a consulting engineer. For the first time since our parents accident, I see Jimmy smile.

I’m standing. My fingers still burn, but the pain is gone. There’s an eerie silence as my eyes slowly adjust to their surroundings. First, all I can see are the pale walls and then slowly blinking lights. The facility, I’m back in the facility.

I try to take a step forward but my foot bumps into something. Soft, spongy almost. When I step back, my shoe skids on the floor. It’s slippery. Slick. Wet. Slowly, the world comes back into view. The facility is covered in blood and pieces of what were once living breathing people haphazardly litter the ground. The arm I bumped into earlier have bits off sinew and shards of bone at the shoulder, whatever did this tore into them.

I scan the room and then I see him. Jimmy. Propped up by one arm, he’s using one hand to draw on the wall. He’s talking furiously, but I still can’t hear him. I try to say something but my mouth can’t make the words. Finally, he finishes what he’s doing and turns. He looks at me with more fear than I’ve never seen in a man.

I take a step towards him and he recoils in terror. It’s only then that I look at my hands and realize, they aren’t hands. Before I can think to look closer, I hear it: a low hum slowly building into a roar.
