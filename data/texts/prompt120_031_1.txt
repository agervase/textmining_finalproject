It's 3:30 am and my mother is calling me. Why the hell would she call me at 3:30 am? She knows what time it is since she's originally from New Jersey. I guess living in California for so long has thrown off her sense of time differences, or she's going senile. Or.. oh god!

In a panic, I fumble for the phone and answer, "Mom? Is everything alright?"

Mom: I'm not sure how to tell you this but...  It's your father.

Me: What the hell are you talking about? Dad's been gone for years, he left us when I was just turning 6. Mom, are you... seeing things?

Mom: Don't you take that tone with me! I haven't lost my wits yet, I'm not like your grandmother.  Listen to me, your brother Jimmy is on the way over, but I wanted to call you and your brother Dave that your father is home. He... Looks different.

Me: Alright mom this is ridiculous, can we face time or something? Hold on, let me get out bed and get dressed so we can talk.

Wife: Jesus christ, what the hell Chris? It's 3:40 am, I've got work in an hour, what does your *mother* want now?

Me: Hang on mom..  **Turns to wife** Go back to sleep Shirley, something is going on, I'll tell you afterwards.

Wife: Fine whatever, I swear to god if this isn't an emergency, I'm going to have some words for your mother.

**Heads to the office and hits up facetime** Me: Ok Mom, I'm here, what's going on?

**Camera shuffles hearing a man's voice in the background. Mom appears on the phone** Mom: Chris, can you see me?

Me: Yeah mom what's up? You look like you've been crying.

Mom: Uhm **shaky voice and clears the throat** I'd like you to see who it is.. **phone pans to a man in his 40s**

Me: D..Dad?! **starts crying** wh..  What happened? I thought you left us?

Dad: Heya kiddo...  This is so weird. I'm not sure what happened but it looks like some things have changed since last I saw you. How old are you now? 50s? Jesus, what the hell happened?
