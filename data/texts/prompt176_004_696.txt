There were four of us.  We'd meet every couple hundred years and discuss the pranks we pulled on the mortals.  Such good fun the mortals were.  So easily susceptible to manipulation.  Would we be so simple if we lived less than a century?  Barely the blink of an eye, I can't imagine that being my entire existance.  

"Ok, I got a good one," I said as I sipped my poisonous drink.  Since we were immortal, alcohol didn't even affect us.  Cyanide for me, Arsenic for Tom, and Mercury for Bill.  John was the sober one.  "It kinda built off yours, Bill."

"Oh?"  Bill cocked his head.  

"Yeah, remember when you got the primitives to waste precious resources building huge monuments when they could've been feeding themselves?"

Bill laughed.  "Yeah, those Egyptians were a fun bunch."

"Well, I got the Americans to think they're being controlled by them."

"What?!"

"Yeah.  I just leave pictures of pyramids and triangles around, and they just take it from there.  So many are convinced there's some secret society pulling the strings."

All three of them burst laughing.  

"Wait," Tom said.  "So all you had to do was put some pictures around, and they think there's some society controlling everything?!"

I laughed.  "Yep.  Just added the pyramid to the dollar bill and it took off."

John shook his head.  "A secret society of mortals.  As if they could organize anything.  Some of them still think my costume is a real animal, they call it bigfoot."

"Can't they tell it's a costume?"  Tom asked.  

"Oh, I use an active camoflage to make the area appear out of focus so they never see me clearly."  He showed us a picture, and indeed, you could barely tell it was him.  As immortals, we also invented a few things here and there.  

"I've been sinking ships at the Bermuda Triangle," Bill said.  

"Dude, people have died," I said.  "I love it!"

We all burst into laughter and clinked our drinks together.  Except for John.  Fucking John.
