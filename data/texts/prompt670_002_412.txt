A polyharmonic scream pierced the air of the Klatsu-District. The buzzing ululation sang out from the center of the public park where a petrified Klatsu Matriarch, clutching her cretchlings close within her several breast sacs, stood with all four mouths agape.

Her cloudy eyes were fixed on a small point on the ground and with her free digit she pointed down accusingly at it. All around other passing Klatsu spun in response to the warning call. Soon enough hundreds of feeble Klatsu eyes began scanning the ground in desperate search. 

Eventually one of the diminutive Klatsu males confirmed the terrible discovery. His two small mouths wrenched open and a staccato warning began to clack from them into the air, joining with the first matriarch's call.

It only took a few moments then before the entire district, nearly fifteen thousand Klatsu immigrants, joined in the terrible chorus. Each added a new and profoundly alien sound until the ground itself echoed beneath the otherwordly weight of their voices. 

This was a Klatsu death call - a mourning certainty of imminent doom, reserved only for those most horrible moments when no hope existed for salvation.

As the cacaphony of suffering aliens raged on, another sound struggled to pierce the tidal wave of noise. It began as a distant whine and crescendoed as it grew nearer. 

As the Klatsu at the periphery of the district saw it approach, the tone of their song changed subtly - from the song of despair to the song of fleeting, impossible hope. The announcement of potential salvation grew in volume with the approaching siren until it too took over the district. 

In the plaza a large red fire truck came to a screeching halt, honking its horn ferociously, wielding the noise like a sonic cudgel to force the nearly catatonically afraid Klatsu out of the way. 

Before the truck even came to a full stop several heavily suited human men began leaping off its side. Together, ears plugged in preparation for the emergency response into the Klatsu sector, they worked in tandem silence. In a well rehearsed ballet of concerted effort, the firemen began preparing their hose, seeking out the nearest hydrant and opening all the necessary valves on the truck. They worked with practiced certainty, moving efficiently and in unison even though unable to communicate verbally in the sound storm of Klatsu panic. 

As the men worked, one of them began looking around the plaza for the source of the commotion. However for the life of him he couldn't see a fire of any kind. 

Finally the man walked over to the precise gps location of the original caller, tracking his location using an optical implant over his right retina. Parsing through the paralyzed Klatsu singers made it difficult to focus or make way, but eventually, pushing and shoving, the fireman made it to the original caller. When he did, standing there beside the Klatsu matriarch who started the singing, the fireman looked around and quickly saw the source of the district wide commotion. 

On the cement of the plaza floor a small brown paper bag was burning. The fire had mostly gone out and now mostly just smoldered. Nonetheless the matriarch, and all the nearby Klatsu, stared at the bag in abject horror, their song still one hundred percent certain doom was inevitable. 

The fireman sighed and began waving toward his other crewmates, giving them the pre-arranged signal for "false alarm." They knew the signal well, seeing as they were all assigned to the Klatsu district and made calls like this at least three times a week. 

This was probably the work of some human teenagers playing a practical joke. The fireman made a vain if cursory effort to find the little shits in the plaza, wherever they were snickering to themselves. Then he stepped over to the paper bag and stomped the fire out in a couple of heavy steps of his rubber boots. 

The Klatsu went momentarily silent. The original matriarch who called the fire in slowly shut her mouths and turned her evolutionarily weak eyeballs towards the fireman, filled with utter amazement. After a few seconds more a new song emanated from her mouths - this one high pitched and tone perfect, like four voices dancing with each other in an expression of pure joy.

The other Klatsu took up the call, the males clomping triumphantly, keeping an incredibly complex beat behind the female chorus, until the air trembled with their cumulative relief. 

Beneath the glorious aura of this otherwordly song the firemen loaded up the truck once again and filed back inside. Siren off, lights blaring, the truck began to inch its way back toward the fire house, slowly making it through the hordes of grateful alien forms. 

Inside the truck, now sealed from the outside sound by specially designed windows and doors, the fireman unplugged their ears. The man who stomped out the fire just shook his head and raised his eyebrows incredulously. 

"Fucking Klatsu, amirite?"
