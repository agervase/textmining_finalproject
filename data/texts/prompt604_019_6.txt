"I...I don't know if I can do this." I was shaking so badly it was making my armour rattle. "W-why can't we just let Sid be king?"

Death glared down at me, or at least I assume that's what he was doing, what with having no eyes in the sockets of his skull, and the skull being rigid bone that showed no expression whatsoever. Yet I could still feel his annoyance with me.

*YOU KNOW THAT SID IS A 40 YEAR OLD CHILD*, he told me. *I WOULD TRUST A LABRADOR IN A BUTCHER'S SHOP BEFORE I TRUSTED SID WITH FEEDING MY GOLDFISH FOR A WEEK END.*

"Good point," I sighed, thinking of poor Blinky. I'd only had her three months. I swallowed hard and asked, "Do you think I stand a chance?"

*YOUR CHANCES ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THAT OF YOUR OTHER SIBLINGS.*

"Yeah, but, can I win this thing?" I cringed a little. "*Do* I want to win this thing?"

Death touched what might have been his mouth at one time as he contemplated what I'd just said. *THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION, TOM. A TRUE LEADER DOES NOT SEEK TO LEAD. THE MANTLE IS OFTEN THRUST UPON THEM.*

I listened to the spectators outside, already screaming for blood. This wasn't just a battle royale for the throne; this was entertainment. I glanced at my brother Sid, who was being coached by Loki, the Norse Trickster God. I suppose this was fitting. My brother Andrew was talking quietly with the Egyptian Sun God, Ra. My sister Stephanie listened to the Greek goddess Athena, who was showing her the weakest points of our armour. Meanwhile, our youngest brother, David, was getting a vigorous shoulder rub from Dionysus, and neither had put on their armour yet...much less their shirts. So much finally made sense.

And here I sat in my corner of the arena with...Death. When all the gods and goddesses of all time and space had arrived to take our parents to the next world, he was among them, and it was he who glided to my side when Sid contested our father's final decree: the last of us standing would be crowned sovereign over the land.

*THEY ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN*, Death said softly. *I HAVE ONLY ONE BIT OF ADVICE FOR YOU.*

"What's that, then?" I said, a little bitterly, because he hadn't really said much of anything to me.

Death leaned closer and spoke so only I could hear him: *KEEP RUNNING.*

I stared at him. "*What?!*"

Bishop Bernard suddenly chose that moment to call out "Royal siblings! Prepare to battle!"

Death patted my arm and urged me forward. *REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU. KEEP RUNNING.*

I couldn't help whimpering as I moved toward the centre of the arena. David had finally put on his armour, and his shirt, although why he chose a very short Roman plateskirt, and why he shaved his legs, is beyond me.

Although I could hear Bishop Bernard's instructions, I couldn't tell you what he said. I just saw Sid staring daggers at each of us in turn. Stephanie was taking long, slow, deep breaths. Andrew looked very determined. I just prayed I wouldn't wet myself from fear.

Then I heard the horns, and Sid's war cry just before he swung his sword at David's exposed left arm. The poor man screamed and I ran. I ran from the shouting, the clanging of metal on metal, the jeers of the crowd, Bishop Bernard's enthusiastic commentary, and if I'm honest with myself I was also running away from my feelings. But this is not a therapy session, so we shan't get into that.

The arena was fully closed off. All I could do was run. I dropped my sword and shield to lighten my load. Soon I was stripping off my helmet and chainmail as well, until I was merely in my jherkin and trousers. I slipped in the mud a few times but never fell. I could only wait for Sid or someone else to come after me, slice me open, and end my anguish. Until then, I'd keep running.

Or at least I would until I ran out of breath. I began to slow down until I was so exhausted it was all I could do to remain standing. I stopped to lean against the arena wall. As I gulped air into my burning lungs I noticed it was awfully quiet in that arena. There was no metal clanking or clanging. No war cries. No screams of agony. Even the audience had reduced themselves to whispers. This was very suspicious indeed.

I caught my breath and looked to my siblings. There was only one problem: they were gone. And by gone, I mean they were dead or dying. I saw all four of them lying in the mud. Curiosity got the better of me and I walked over to David, who was still clutching the spot where his arm had been. His face was ghostly white from exsanguination. I started to kneel down to comfort him until his good arm went limp and his eyes rolled upward in their sockets.

"Oh my," Bishop Bernard said as he came toward me. "It seems the others were stupid enough to kill each other off. Since you're technically the last one standing..." He reached for my hand and thrust it skyward. "All hail King Thomas! Long live the king!"

The citizens hesitated before echoing his sentiments, albeit reluctantly, as if they couldn't believe what had just happened. I certainly couldn't. Bishop Bernard dropped my arm just as Death glided over to congratulate me.

*WELL DONE, KING THOMAS,* he said. *I SEE YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO ME.*

I watched the other gods sigh and file out dejectedly. I asked Death, "Did you know this would happen?"

Death chuckled and replied, *IT WAS THEIR LUST FOR POWER THAT KILLED THEM ALL. I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. YOU WILL BE A GOOD KING. YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO LOOK TO OTHERS WHO ARE MUCH MORE QUALIFIED, TO SEEK THEIR ADVICE, AND TO WEIGH IT BEFORE ENGAGING IT.*

The realisation struck me just then: who better to help you kill your foes than someone whose sole purpose is to bring death? I watched him round up my siblings' souls and depart from the arena, all of them looking terribly angry with each other...and themselves.
