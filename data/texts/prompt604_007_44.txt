"Death, you say."

The figure nodded, clad in black robes. Its face was obscured by shadow, with a hint of bone white peeking through where a chin would be. "WE ARE DEATH."

"I never imagined 'death' as a god."

"WE ARE NOT A SINGULAR GOD, BUT A COLLECTIVE OF GODS THAT REPRESENT A PARTICULAR PROCESS TO WHICH ALL BEINGS ARE SUBJECT."

"Collective?"

"YOU COULD THINK OF US AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION."

"Oh, any members I'd know?"

"ANUBIS, HADES, HEL, THE ADVERSARY, GROMUSH THE THRASHER-"

"Sorry, don't know that one."

"VERY NEW MEMBER. I BELIEVE HE REPRESENTS A HIDDEN, SMALL TRIBE DEEP WITHIN GOTH LANDS."

"Wow, you must recruit very aggressively."

"WE TAKE PRIDE IN INCLUSIVITY." The figure pushed a document forward. "READ AND SIGN. AT YOUR LEISURE, OF COURSE."

The document presented an unfamiliar script that shifted and moved into a form I could understand. "Pen?"

"A SOULWELL BRAND. HELL'S FINEST."

"What?!"

"JUST KIDDING. IT'S NORMAL BLACK INK."

"Oh, thank the gods."

"WE DON'T HAND THE GOOD STUFF TO MORTALS."

"Oh..."

I signed the document with the pen and handed it back. "What now?"

"YOU'LL BE EXEMPTED FROM THE DEATH PROCESS"

"Ok, sounds good. Do I get a death... touch... Or something...?"

"NO. YOUR BENEFITS ARE NOT SO GRAND."

"Huh."

"ACTUAL KILLING IS MORE OF A WAR-GOD THING ANYWAY."

"So, what exactly do you give me?"

"YOU WILL BE GRANTED AUTHORITY TO MAKE DEALS IN EXCHANGE FOR SOULS."

"How exactly does that help me win the Battle Royal?!"

"YOU WILL ENTER THESE AGREEMENTS AS OUR REPRESENTATIVE AND THE TERMS WILL BE VERY UNFAVORABLE TO YOUR... CLIENTS. THEY WILL INEVITABLY FAIL IN SHORT TIME, FALLING ONE BY ONE, FILLING OUR HALLS AND COFFERS WHILE YOU GAIN POWER IN KIND."

"That sounds... complicated."

"YES. WE KNOW. THE LEGIONS OF EVERY HELL AND UNDERWORLD WILL ALSO BE AT YOUR BECK AND CALL."

"Oh, that's better."
