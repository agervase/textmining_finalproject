"You can seriously fix this?" the construction worker asked, scratching the back of his head with wonder.

"Sure, I don't see why not. So, what are you looking for? A park or something?" I said, pulling back my sleeves and raising my arms at the wall in front of me.

"No, we were just intending on extending the road here. But for way more than your asking price," he muttered.

"Not a problem," I said, and heaved at the energy within me, giving life to the wall before me. My eyes rolled back into my head and I closed them. The wall shook and crumbled, and finally moved itself out of the way, adding asphalt to the floor below it at it moved aside. I turned back to the worker and said with my eyes still closed:

"What was once a dead end is now a living road," I announced gravely, opening my eyes once more.

"That's incredible!" he yelled. "No hard hats, no machinery, no nothin'! You're the real deal!"

"And we had a real deal, as well," I reminded him, patiently. I smiled at the praise.

"Oh, yeah. $10,000 in cash, as agreed. Go bless another part of the world with your magics!" he said, simultaneously shaking my hand and giving me the wad of cash. I took it gratefully and went on my way, robes billowing in the wind passing through what used to be the wall. I counted the money and quickly pocketed it. Before I could even leave the site, another worker put a tough arm on my shoulder. He gripped me tightly and I turned to him, unsurprised. Most people approached me with some form of nervousness.

"Are you aware of my asking price?" I began.

He nodded, slowly. 

"What can I bring back to life?"

He blushed and looked to the ground. 

"I uh.." he gripped at his hard hat hesitantly. I waited for him patiently as he looked to me and back to the floor. 

"If you're willing to pay $10,000, surely you're willing to tell me what you want brought back?" I pushed. Only gently. Push too hard and they'd get upset and leave you.

"Yes, umm... the missus and I... we haven't really been..." he blushed even deeper. 

"I believe I understand," I said, with a slight smile. I pulled back my sleeves and pointed my arms at him.

"Whoa, are you gonna--"

"Please remain still," I said, eyes rolling to the back of my head. I could feel him trembling in front of me. He let out slight whimpers as he felt the power coursing through him. Finally, just as I finished casting the spell, he crashed onto the floor. 

"Did yo--"

"What was once a dead bedroom is now a living relationship," I announced, proudly. I opened my hand for my payment. He looked skeptical, but as soon as he stood up, he received a call. 

"Oh my God, she never calls me at work," he said excitedly, throwing the money at me so he could take the call.

I continued on my way home, $20,000 richer when I was once again approached by a client. It was a much smaller one, closer to the age of 12, it seemed. He was holding a 10 dollar bill very tenderly in his small fingers.

"Can you help me with the kid from my school, Joey?" he asked, holding back tears.

My heart dropped. It was always the worst when the young had witnessed such a traumatic experience as the death of a peer. I knelt down to his height and closed his hands over his money.

"I'm so sorry. I can help you. Where did he die?" I asked compassionately.

He cocked his head to one side, not understanding my question. Perhaps he didn't understand the concept of death yet.

"Joey's not dead. But you help with dead things, right?" he asked, a tear rolling down his face.

"Of course, I will help in whatever way I can," I said, opening my arms paternally to him. 

He sniffed and wiped away the tear with a trembling hand. 

"Well Joey," he stopped to sniffle again, "Today Joey said I was dead meat!" he cried.

*That was a new one.*
