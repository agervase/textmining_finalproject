Loathing. Reassurance, I guess. Those were the last feelings on my mind.

I guess nothing prepares you for something so crazy that if someone told you while you were alive, you'd never believe it. Just another stupid conspiracy theory, just another ridiculous religious belief. It's not like that, though. The craziest things happen after you die.

As for me, I caused it all. I thought it'd all be completely over with after I was done. That after I got that clean cut on my neck, nothing else would matter. I hated myself. I gave myself so much shit for nothing. There wasn't anything wrong with me. I just made something out of...

Nothing. And that was what was left after I died. Nothing else existed except her. She stood smiling at me. Not nicely, as you would think. It was the smile you gave before laughing maniacally. We both wore nothing, floating in front of each other. I felt the feeling of drowning, minus the water. "Idiot," I expected an echo but none came.

"Excuse me..?" She was a complete stranger. How could she say that about me? About her...? She laughed at my puzzled demeanor.  It all came together. "Bitch!" I struggled to move. "Why, don't say that about yourself, You. You caused this. You brang me here. And gave me *this*." She pointed to it. If I could've thrown up, I would've. "I killed you!" I mouthed, but nothing came out. She was there, right in front of me. With my knife.

Hell couldn't be much worse than this. It's all about who you were. She cut, and cut. "It still hurts, doesn't it?" she cried. "You did this to yourself! You didn't deserve it! *I* didn't deserve it!" 

My soul. My emotion. She was cutting into my flesh, and it was all my fault.
