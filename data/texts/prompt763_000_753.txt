Paula Shugart stood at the head of the table with a lockjawed expression, eyebrows furrowed as the military personnel scrambled around her. 

"Any moves on the back end of the ship?" someone asked.

"Nothing out of the ordinary, it seems they only intend on communication," another answered quickly, flipping through pages of notes on the desk in front of him.

"Yes but their communication expressed that they're offended that they weren't invited previously!" the first answered.

General Pike slammed a fist on the desk, immediately quieting the room and directing attention toward him. The room stood in silence for a moment as he let it breathe. His eyes scanned the room of prestigious individuals under his command and stopped on the one who wasn't.

"What do you know about the aliens, Shugart?" he asked in a calm voice. 

"Me? I hardly believe I deserve any blame for this, I was just as aware of their existence as anyone in here. If anything, it's the government's fault for not having previously discovered aliens!" she spat. 

The room held its breath as it refocused on Pike. He chuckled quietly, cleared his throat, and commanded,

"I want an audience with the aliens. Whether in person or over a video call is not important, I want them by the end of the hour. And I want Shugart with me."

The room exploded in motion as each person filed out to fill the order except for Paula, whose eyes were still blinking in confusion at the proclamation. She finally regained her senses when it was almost empty, save for one man in the room in charge of informing Pike of any info happening on the outside and relaying his orders to the greater military. 

"Why would *I* be the one to go with you? Why not a platoon? Or an orator!? Anyone but me!"

"Shugart, I'm no happier about this than you are, but they referred to you by name in their first line of communication, and they--"

"Yes, I'm well aware they--"

"They referred to you as *President of the Universe.* Not President of *Miss* Universe. They believe you to be the leader here and would become more offended if approached by anyone otherwise."

"But--" she bit her tongue and pursed her lips angrily, fuming for a reason not to have to go see the otherworldly beings. "What will it take for me not to have to talk to--"

"Pike," the communication officer said, "they want to have an audience now. Miss Shugart and her bodyguard. They want it in front of their craft. They also specified not to take any 'mind weapons.'" he relayed, not looking up from his screen for a second. 

"Looks like we're on," Pike said, opening a palm and guiding Shugart out of the command room. She stomped her way out of the room but otherwise wasn't brave enough to put up any more objections. 

Approaching the ship on foot, they saw two beings that seemed to be made entirely of limbs. Instead of walking, it seemed they rolled on a mass of arms that came and went with every movement towards them. Pike clenched his jaw in disgust but remained steadfast at the sight. Shugart had gone pale but kept her gait as well.

Each of the species stopped about five feet from one another, not wanting to get any closer either in disgust or in fear of mind weapons. They gave each other a look over, trying to understand how the species even existed at their form. How to move with only so many limbs. How to create ships when it seemed they had no eyes. Finally, the creatures spoke first, in perfect, unbroken English:

"We come only to ask a question to the Universe President," they said simultaneously, turning their bodies toward her. "Why is it that you've refused us an invitation to Miss Universe in the past?"

Shugart remained frozen in place until Pike cleared his throat loudly. She jumped slightly in fear but finally put a thought together. 

"We were not aware of your existence," she answered plainly. 

The beings murmured in understanding, then followed up with another question,

"That may be, but may we participate this year?" they asked excitedly.

Paula looked frightened but answered quickly.

"No," she answered, as plainly as the first time. 

"And why not?" they asked.

"You're--" she looked to Pike, and shrugged apologetically, knowing what her words would do, "you're really ugly."
