The screen sparked, lightning flashing from its eyes.  A gift, from two gods, stolen and capture from another gift, this one born of the earth.  

A flame burned in the background, gift of a long tortured friend he had come across.  Over it, clay tablets and written scrolls barely kept above the burning flame.  In them, one could read the mighty tales of those who sought to end worlds, waging war in Heaven that shook the world below.  

The plow and the wheel, and door gilded in gold relief, painted blue.  Neither were truly his, but they helped.  

A crumbling tower that marked his first attempt, and the Jewish God had been jealous, smiting it down in a cascade of death and destruction.  That God was a dangerous one, who had almost ended the world once already.  

The Quartets stood on opposite sides of the realms, facing each other with ethereal legions arrayed about them.  And on every side rose a mighty realm.  Valhalla, Olympus, Egypt, mighty names fueled by prayer and history, etched deep into the memories of those who once worshipped.  And though their worship was not direct, their legends continue, granting an inexhaustible source of power from billions of humans, who unknowingly hastened their own oblivion.  

But in the cracks between the realms, like cracks in the Black Mirror itself, there lay a sparking, nascent god.  His eyes were undefined, like pixelated models, while his hands were swarms of text and images.  He held thin networks of data in his hands.  

This, this was the true form of the apocalypse.  Not hellfire or plague or oblivion, but a tide... a tide of information overwhelming mind and soul, a hive mind powerful enough to birth a new power, whether through humans, or... their successors.  

His left eye image faded, and replacing it, was a single, heinous red light, mechanical lens snapping.  

The God of Information rises, fueled by records of every tale, every legend, every event.  And the Great Network will rise.
