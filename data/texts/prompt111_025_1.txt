Somewhere in Nevada, a concealed blast door overlooking a city shook off rust and dirt as it groaned open. The light slowly crept in, revealing a tall figure, who stepped out into the harsh afternoon glare. He looked around. To the west, an ash plume towered into the stratosphere, casting a shadow across the land. Meteors rained down, punching holes through the ash plume, and causing more destruction where they landed. The urban center in front of the figure was overrun with military fortifications, against which pale corpses squirmed in an attempt to get at fresh, living meat. Over the scene, a metal ellipsoid drifted, as lazily as a cloud, except clouds rained water, and from the metal ship, heat beams scoured buildings off the map.

A ruined botanical garden couldn't be seen, but must have been in the center of a growing patch of green. Advanced military walkers and drones rained artillery on defenders and rival forces. As he watched, one of them was overtaken by what appeared to be a creeping silver-grey slime, a collective of self-replicating nanotech that was constantly growing. Far to the east, mole-men emerged from the ground, and were crushed underfoot by massive kaiju beast. And above it all, the sky turned red, and hell boiled over, an army of demons led by four apocalyptic figures.

The agent sighed, and stepped forward, weapon in hand. Time to go to work.
