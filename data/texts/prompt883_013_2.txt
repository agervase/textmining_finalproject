When I was born, I'm told I was malnutritioned and had a very low chance of surving. I've been ill my entire life, as long as I can remember. Since I was a child. My immune system isn't like yours. The flu might mean a day or two off work for you; it could be a death sentence for me.

With the physical ailments come mental troubles. We're afraid you're going to hurt yourself. I heard that a lot. You'd think it'd be easy to take my own life. It's not. I was a coward. I never went through with it, but I tried once. Took a handful of pills with two bottles of wine. I woke up in the ER surrounded by my family and friends. The ones who loved me.

I know I'm not easy to love. I need to be taken care of constantly. I can't help myself. My mind may as well be gone. I could die next week. 

But I've made it this far. And I don't know if that's self-will. I don't know if that's all me. Maybe it's an act of God, the trials and tribulations make you stronger don't they? Maybe I was chosen, for some reason, to carry on, and do good in the world.

You can never make change by yourself. You can love yourself, rely on yourself, but in the end, Humans evolved socially. I guess I am lucky. And I've been an atheist since I was five years old. But now, I think maybe there just might be someone up there looking down. There's too much that has happened to be pure coincidence. I'm lucky to have made it this far. I'm lucky to have met her. She saved my life. I'm lucky to have a family, that for the most part is functional and loving. I'm lucky to be alive. 

But I've made it this far.
