"So, are you surprised?" Cogs left to rot for centuries began to spin again slowly. They snapped their fingers in front of me. "You conscious? I know you're breathing." I blinked a few times. They waited patiently for me to speak. My mouth opened. "I-.... I-" They became visibly concerned. "Uh oh. Did your brain not completely thaw?"

"N- n-" The words couldn't escape me. I pulled my newly awakened arm away from my body and looked at it. "Five...hundred...years." I looked at them. "I....was-" My arm went limp as I released control of it. Spots began to fill my eyes. I began to fall. 

"Hey, you awake?" I opened my eyes to them- no, her standing over me. My brain was working at full speed. Somehow I had avoided insanity, though I had been alone for 500 years. "I am awake." I appeared to be in some sort of hospital, with the expected technological improvements 500 years would bring. I looked at her eyes.  "If we count age by years conscious I am five-hundred and twenty-two."
"Do you mean to say your brain was never frozen?" She asked me.
"I have been trapped in my own mind for five centuries. My sanity remains somehow, but I have nothing other to say." Something clicked. I jumped out of the hospital bed. "Where's the room with the cryo-pods?"

"I-its just down the hallway." I raced off to the cryo-pods. "Hey! You can't just run off!" I was trailed by who I assumed was a doctor. I found the pods, and I went through row after row till I found the pod with my wife inside it. 

"Is there something special about her?" The doctor asked. I looked at the doctor. "Yes. Unfreeze her." The doctor obliged, though the date of thawing was a few days away. My wife tumbled out of the pod into my open arms. She began to cry. "I know. I know." I whispered.  Five hundred years is a long... long... time.
