-”Calm down Bob. It's ok to be nervous. I know this is your first big project. But remember, I was an intern too. A few millenia ago I didn't know how set up a simple gravitational constant and now I'm managing the entire Andromeda galaxy.”
-”But I don't know what to do. The Mercury project was so much simpler than this. It had no life or water or any of the complicated features Earth has. I'm worried I'll ruin everything. You should have picked Justin instead, he managed that Pluto deprecation very smoothly”
-”Relax Bob. Earth isn't such a big deal as the higher ups would want you believe. It's one of the first legacy simulations that turned out well, so they have some emotional attachment. But believe me, underneath that pretty green and blue UI, it's a pretty crappy simulation. That's why we'll give it to you for your graduation project and then we'll shut it down with a good old meteorite process.”
-”What do you mean it's a bad simulation? I think it's pretty impressive. It has all these concurrent systems going on”
-”Well, for one, water physics were a pain to get right. After wasting over %60 of real state of the globe we still had to add the Moon module to make it work properly, which frankly is just a waste of resources and every few years it gets in the way of the lightning engine. Good thing we managed to pass it off as the “eclipse feature”. That was quick thinking.”
-”What about life? Isn't the life module filled with complicated AI implementations?”
-”That's the least of your worries. Most of the earthlings are self sufficient and require little maintenance. We tried to get fancy with the humans, but the behavior engine we came up was so buggy we ended up replacing most of it with a random number generator. If you pay attention you'll often see them getting into rooms and immediately forgetting what they were going to do. Some of them get permanent knee damage after falling off in a simple jogging routine. Their hardware is trash, really. We cared more about having a big sample population”
-”Alright. I'll try my best. Should I do something about the Global Warming Alarm? I was checking the dashboards earlier and that one has been in RED state for a few decades now.”
-”We probably should do something. We were going to get rid of fossil fuels but we got lazy and opted for hiding it under a few background layers. We didn't expected humans to find those hidden assets. Anyway, don't give it too much thought.  We'll wipe the simulation in a few cycles anyway”
-”Ok boss. Thanks for the info. I'll start right away”
-”One last thing Bob. You'll notice the prayer chat gets spammed constantly. Just click on the mute button. I never cared about those messages anyway”
