Hell was a terrible place.




















I know that was an understatement but I felt that it had to be said and for the record I’d like to also say that I don’t deserve this.
What was this might you ask?
This, was being surrounded by history's greatest (or worst depending on your definition) killers in human history.







They were all in a meeting, wondering what to do with me.







“We should throw him out.” Yelled Hitler. “He doesn’t belong here!”







“Quiet you!” Answered Emperor Palpatine. “We need all the bodies we can get!”
















“Hey!” I cried out. “I like Hitler’s idea! I don’t belong in Hell at all!”







“No no no.” A well dressed man answered. “He’s not talking about throwing you out of Hell, he’s talking about throwing you out of this building.”







“Uhhh.”






“Oh, where are my manners? I am Professor Moriarty, I am sure you’ve heard of my exploits?”







I hadn't. “Of course!” He didn’t seem to believe me but was polite enough to not show it. “So what’s so bad about outside? Fire?”





“No, something worse.” The killers of every time period shuddered as one. “Let me ask you a question, where do you think dogs go when they die?”





“Heaven?”





“Most of them, yes, now… where do you think Wasps go?”





It was then that I heard some buzzing and the shattering of glass.





Moriarty for once seemed off put. “Let me just tell you this boy, there aren’t just killers here in Hell, they also put in the ass holes, the pranksters and let’s just say that somewhere in that mix Hell also got Wasp breeders.”





Wasp breeders? Why the Hell would you want more Wasps? My vision was soon covered by a buzzing mess of rage and from then on I knew nothing but pain.
