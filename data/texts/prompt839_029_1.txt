Nothing but darkness all around me. Suddenly I see a light and begin to head towards it. At the other end I meet with a hooded man in a black robe.

“Well, well, well. It appears that someone’s dead”  He grins at me with his skeletal face, unblinking. “As is customary with all the newly deceased you get to play me in a chess game. Are you ready to begin?”

I just stare at him, nervous for what I’m about to tell him.

“I don’t know how to play chess...”

The hooded figure just stares back at me. After a few passing moments he starts to laugh hysterically. “Are you kidding me?! Ha! This’ll be much easier than I thought!” In between of laughs he says, “Here read this!” as he throws me a small rulebook. “As soon as your ready, we’ll start! This’ll be quick game...”

A few hours later...

“WHAT?! HOW DID I LOSE?! THIS IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE! NOBODY HAS EVER BEAT ME! EVER!!” 

“I don’t know... sorry?” I don’t know how I beat him and don’t know what’s going to happen.

The hooded figure takes a deep breath and after he seems to calm down he just stops. “Okay, okay, this is okay. This is all fine. We’re all good. Nothing is wrong.” He then just stares at me, seeming to be deep in thought.

“Sooo... Now what?”

He looks up at me with a terrifying stare.
“What happens now? You think I know what happens now? You think this happens every day?!”

“Well, obviously not...”

The hooded figure just puts his head down. He seems to be completely broken and I start to feel actually bad for him. After a few moments he finally responds to me. “Look I just don’t know what to do okay? I-I’ve never been in this situation before,,, I-I guess I just need some time to think about this...”

“So what should I do then? Do I just sit here forever until you come up with something or...”

“No. You know what? This has been a huge embarrassment to me so just, just go back. I’ll see you in a few more years and then, if you win again somehow, I’ll have something ready, okay?”

“So I can go back to life?”

“Yeah, just go and leave me alone...”

“Okay then... I guess I’ll just go... See you in a few years I guess?”

“Yeah just leave already...”

I turn back around and head back towards the light and head back to life. I have three things on my mind right now. 

1. I forgot to ask his name.
2. How did I even win?
and finally
3. I better practice chess these next few years.
