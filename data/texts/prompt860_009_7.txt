“Jay! I’m home!” I shout into the apartment tiredly as I shut the door behind me. I vaguely hear buzzing sounds from his room as I go to grab a sandwich or something from the fridge, only to find the entire fridge covered in pink ooze. Kyle sprints out of his room, quickly shutting the door behind him in a feeble attempt to hide the obvious blue glow coming from inside. I completely ignore this, of course. 
“Dude, you gotta get rid of the pink stuff in here. That’s nasty. I’m not eating food with that all over it.” I tell him. He cocks his head and grabs a clipboard that was *somehow* inside his jacket.
“So you could see this one? Intriguing-“
*”This one?* Buddy, not okay. Don’t touch my food.” I shout. He slinks back- he hates when I shout at him. For some reason, raising my voice terrifies him. He just nods sadly and puts his clipboard away.

Let’s be very clear- I only put up with this guy because his concept of money is a little messed up, and he obviously has infinite of it.
He has $100 confused with $1000. If you ask for $1, he gives you $10. When I asked for his half of the rent the first time, he gave me 10 times that amount, and in cash! It’s pretty great. We’ve lived together for a year now, and I just ignore all of the signs. It’s great.

“What food have you not messed with?” I ask, calming down.
“I have not experimented with the food in the panty.” He says, trying to smile casually (completely failing, may I add.) 
“The... pantry? Okay thanks.” I grab a box of cereal and head into my room. I hear a whirring sound the moment I close the door. I try to sit down and just eat my cereal, but it lasts a solid 10 minutes and it’s really creepy. Punching myself inwardly for giving in to the curiosity, I peek out the door to see Kyle, with some sort of vacuum-looking thing, just going after the fridge. He sees me, and again looks terrified. I yawn.
“G’night, dude.” He smiles.
“Good night, earthli- I mean, ‘friend.’”
