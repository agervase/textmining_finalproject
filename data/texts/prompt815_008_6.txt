I gazed blankly at the sea of fruits before me, and I knew I had to buy them. I had to buy a ridiculous amount, 24 watermelons and 36 apples to be exact, and I didn't know why. It wasn't up to me, if that makes any sense. I just had to. Now, I'm not one to have compulsive tendencies, and more pressingly, I certainly am not someone with disposable income. I work my job, 9 to 5, I sit at a desk, I waste time on Reddit, I try to get by. I'm a normal person, and I had to rationalize this in a normal way. Rationalize? Why did I pick that word? It seems somehow resonant, like it connects in some way or another to my purpose on a global scale. Yet, as I attempted to organize my thoughts once more, I dropped 12 watermelons. And I froze. How many does that leave me with? Sweat coursed down my face. I should know this. What is wrong with me? I felt as though I should have studied better, like this was proof of some sort of function, one I was not seeing properly. Proof? Function? Why am I assaulted by words I cannot evaluate or rationalize? When I woke up this morning, I had no expectation of anything incongruent to take place. I did my normal routine, rise out of bed, run to the toilet. I eat my cereal (an integral part of every morning) and I take the number line down to my job. But today, I understand something else, a variable I'd been ignoring, something greater than me. Some distant factor, and as my mind tried to triangulate and grasp at what it was, I realized I was approaching my limit. Then, I touched upon the common denominator in my life, that I was the product of something external. Some iota of an answer occurred to me, and though it was irrational, I came to a disturbing thought. I was not a real figure.
