**October 3rd, 1983,**

**14,757th day on patrol,**

**700 miles east of Bermuda**

"Two contacts, sir. About two miles off our starboard bow. Type: unkown, but at least one of them is definitely not ours." Johansen reported from behind the sonar.

I nodded. The enemy had deployed a slew of new submarines over the years, this was a big one. The other one might have been ours, or possibly British. Definitely not German.

"All ahead full, intercept course!" I barked the command, which brought the crew to frantic action. There was no trepidation, only weariness and grim determination. We had all been at sea for way too long and were itching for a fight. Can you blame us?

"Clarke, prepare tube one for launch!" I shouted into the horn. An enthusiastic "Aye aye!" came in reply from the torpedo bay. Clarke and his boys had been waiting for this for some time.

According to Johansen, the vessel we assumed friendly seemed to be in hiding, while the big bogey was preparing to fire. The periscope was useless, the waters were pitch black in the night and would have beem murky at this depth even in full daylight. There was no time to spare, and I ordered tube 1 fired as soon as we had a tentative firing solution based on sonar alone.

"Tube one, failed to launch Sir!" Clarke's frantic voice issued from the horn. "It won't open!"

Cold sweat began to run on my forehead. "Prepare tubes two through six for launch! Fire when ready! Lloyd, keep her steady!" My voice was steady, but the worried glances of the bridge crew betrayed my shocked countenance.

"Two thousand feet. Bogey has opened her tubes. No reaction to our sonar pings."

This was out of the ordinary.

"Tube two failed to launch, tube three failed to launch! Could not load tube four... the hatch has rusted shut. We are working on the last two, but it doesn't look good, Sir!"

"A thousand feet!"

My face darkened. There was no use in preparing the aft torpedos, but as far as I could tell, we were still invisible to the enemy.

"Five hundred feet and closing!"

"It has been a privilege to serve with you all these years." My voice was hoarse and quiet, but everyone aboard could have heard a pin drop. I raised my tone in command one last time.

"All ahead flank! Ramming speed!"

Had the men aboard *USS Augusta* been provided that day with a viewing port and a sufficiently strong searchlight, they would have borne witness to a highly unusual sight. At 2238 hours, the silent, barnacle encrusted form of an aged submarine glid noiselessly from the darkness before them and violently struck the side of *K-219,* a Soviet Nuclear Submarine that the *Augusta* had been covertly observing. They did hear the explosion that followed. An official explanation given later was that an explosion had occurred in one of the *K-219's* missile tubes, caused by a saltwater leak. The crew was unable to contain the subsequent leaks and the submarine sank soon thereafter.

Years later, some of the crew of the *Augusta* would admit to a curious story. They could have sworn that mere minutes before the explosion, a distant, resounding shout was heard *from outside the ship,* as if dozens of men cried out in unison.

*"Aye aye Sir!"*

**The incident of K-219 truly occurred on October 3rd, 1983. Six Soviet submariners perished and the vessel itself was eventually lost as a direct result. This retelling is a fictionalized account.**
