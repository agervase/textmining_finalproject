I destroyed Utopia before I figured out how to get rid of my “gift.”

I’ve been teaching history at a small university in the Samish region of the New World for the past year as a visiting professor from Gallia. I taught history for 30 years and was ready to retire. My expertise was on Roman exploration and trade during the industrial era. I was always humble and cautious in my research and teachings so it took me years to realize I had a “gift.”

I was never wrong when it came to history. I was wrong on other subjects quite often but history came naturally to me. The first time I realized I had this “gift” was when I was stumbling in a lecture at this foreign university. I was reading from my notes and accidentally said the wrong date on a war in the iron age. I didn’t realize my mistake until a minute later but the brightest students in class said I was right. I later looked it up and history had changed. The repurcussions were so immense that it caused Rome to expand earlier and faster than what I knew was true. Once I realized what power I had been granted I said something outrageous and the butterfly effect resulted in Rome splitting up relatively early in history and collapsing before the industrial revolution. How I knew this was that suddenly everything about the room changed: the language of instruction, the style of clothing, the architecture, the student demographics, everything. I let the class out early. I learned it was the year 2006, with the numbering based after this new culture’s main diety. Before going to bed, I rewrote my personal history to be a teenaged high school student without any gifts whatsoever for history and woke up with brand new memories with my old life being but a dream from the night before.
