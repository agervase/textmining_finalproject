"Lizard people run the world" the nut jobs always say. Ya fucking right. If we did I wouldn't be wondering how far I can stretch the box of roman. I could also stay warm. The humans don't know nor could understand the hell we been through and what the survivors continue to go through. 

We were once a great people. Our empire stretched far and wide. I remember standing on my patio watching the sunrise with some coffee and a good book. It's amazing how fast everything went to shit. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, it did. Looking back hiding in the sewer, no power, little food, and water. Somehow the hellish existence became the good times.

A few of the survivors and I came up with a stupidly dangerous plan that most likely would fail, but what other choice did we have? Die like a rat and have our species die with us? We decided to go for it. We would not die with a whimper in the dark. If we were to die it would be on our feet. 

We made a break for ODRC4, the most advanced space research center on our planet and where the x-99 was kept. Our species first FTL spacecraft. We got there. Lost a few good souls on the way. But their sacrifice made sure we as a species lived on.

We crash landed here on this planet. We didn't know how your species would react to us. Your species just finished a massive war two solar cycles earlier. We thought it would be best to hide until the time was right. 

No matter what happens to me. By far the worst part of this whole thing was the transmission we got when they showed up. That voice. Just thinking about it sends shivers down my tail. It was eight words. "We are the Borg, prepare to be assimilated."
