The bold greens of grass and trees stood out beautifully under the gentle blue of the open sky. The humming and buzzing of automobiles and electronics overpowered the serene silence as the dawn gave way to the bustle of early morning commutes. 

The humidity of Summer was showing itself in sweat beads on foreheads and air conditioning boxes protruding from windows. 

Tracey could feel none of it though. It had been more than a millennium since she had felt anything at all, at least of the physical realm. 

Before her untimely death at the hands of an armed drug addict, mugging her for the twelve dollars in her wallet and her cell phone before he shot her in the head, Tracey had a very different idea of what the afterlife would be. 

She had expected the other spirits, of course. She had not been alone when she 'awoke' on this plane. There was a sort of relief in that fact. She had been able to communicate and visit with other family and friends who had gone before her and then after her. 

There was no ability to embrace one another, however and as time passed, the talking points that had seemed engaging or interesting in their previous lives lost importance. 

As it turned out, this plane Tracey had passed into at her death was merely a temporary stop. No one really knew exactly what was next but once the last living person to remember you in life passed on, your spirit would shine briefly, for just a few human days, then you would simply and finally fade away. 

After only a few short human months of endless time, Tracey, like most spirits, began to wish for her time to come. 

It was not that she wished death on those she had left behind. It was that watching them live on and make their choices, both bad and good, could be both frustrating and tedious. She could no longer take part in their lives and it only led to a longing for a physical touch as she would see her loved ones tender moments. 

Instead, Tracey had tried to fill her time with the travel she had never been able to afford in life. She would join other passed on loved ones and they would drift to countries and continents. She would float through the Louvre, trying to find the same passionate intrigue for art she had known when she still needed air in her lungs. She would bob and float over the rolling hills of Ireland.

When a living loved one whispered her name while recalling a memory, Tracey was forcibly pulled from wherever she had drifted back to whomever was thinking of her. These moments of being subjected to her loved ones grief caused an ache in Tracey that was as close to a physical feeling as she was able to manifest now. After several years, as more of her fellow spirits would fade into the wind, she began to resent those who kept her tied here. 

She was certain, early on, that it would be only 80 or 90 years at most before she too could escape this purgatory. That, however, was before Professor Wallace and his Eternity chambers.
