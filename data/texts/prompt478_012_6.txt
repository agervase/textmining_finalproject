*I awaken laying in a pod inside an almost empty white room. *

Wait where am I? This isn't the lobby? What's the time, only 3pm, I still have another hour of work. I shouldnt be awake... I.. I.. Should be working, yes, work.. Wait, what is work I've never actually, worked, before.. So much for "scientifically impossible to malfunction" this must be one of those "one off" cases, should have stuck to the old chip. 

Alright, let's just stay calm, I remember there was something about this during our interview, must be in the manuel

*I walk over to the near by desk with nothing but the manuel laying on it*

let's see. Nothing here, nothing here, oh, here we go, "what to do if chip malfunctions - in the impossible event that your chip malfunctions and you're awaken mid shift, please remain calm, and DO NOT go downstairs." 

Is that it? What am I meant to do, starting to sound like those nut jobs who've said they've awoken mid shift and went down and saw some shit. Well, I guess I'll just wait the shift over, wonder what work we actually do here, I wonder what Jamie's doing. 

*I walk out of my room to see an seemingly endless corridor with small prison like doors on each room*

Wha... What the... "YO, HEY, IS ANYBODY HERE? CAN ANYBODY HERE ME" 
This isn't... Where am I? 

*I run to the nearest other room and open the door, all I see is a guy laying inside a sealed pod, I check the next room, then the next, all containing the same thing, people in pods. *

What is this, why is nobody working? What are these pods? how are we supposed to work if we're a sleep, I need to get out of here

*I run to the staircase, and notice it only goes down.*

Wheres the god damn exit, how do I get out of this place, fuck I have to go down. 

*I run down what it had seemed to be an endless flight of stairs to a windowless black door, and open in. A bright light flashes as if I just opened the shades, that slowly faded away to then show thousands of people slaving. At first I thought these were my Co workers, but they were not...*

What the fuck is going on, these aren't... Why aren't they by the computers, they're so skinny and slender.. It's like they haven't eaten in months.. Why are they speaking Russi... What, no. I thought they were killed off after the war.. Why, who's doing this.. 

*I came to the realization that America had taken the Russians as slaves, and to hide them they made them work instead of us.. Essentially replacing us.. But my thought came to an abrupt ending with loud sirens *

Shit what's the time, 3:55.. Fuck I finish in 5 minutes.

*I run back and lock myself in my pod. I awaken at the lobby, i do my usual end of the work shift stuff, sign off, change clothes and say goodbye to the lobiest and walk home, but this time I get stopped in an ally way *

"hey, hey you! Stop! I saw you" I heard behind me, I turned around to see a man stand up behind the bins, he looked almost homeless.

"hey, hey, I saw you, yo-u-you was down there weren't ya, I saw you down stairs" he said slowly beginning to smile

"wait, you've seen it two? What was going on, why are those Russians working down there?"

"hmmm... *chuckles* I thought that too.. Hmm, oh, yes.. They ain't Russian, that's us... We're the slaves.. We didn't win the war... They did.. Those chips don't make you sleep, they make you see thing..."
