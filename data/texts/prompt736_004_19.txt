"God dammit!" he cried. He had a strong Boston accent.

He looked like a cross between Danny De Vito and the devil emoji. He stood two foot high and only had on a pair of khaki shorts on. 
There had been a crack of lightening and a little poof. The demon was not impressed at his summoning...

"I told those guys five times. FIVE! Another goddamn furniture summons." 

He looked over at me and held up his hand as I began to speak - "I'm gonna sort this now once and for ALL. This is the last goddamn time I swear to Gawd"

He pulled out a new Iphone 7. He stabbed at it with his small red hands and black claw like nails. The phone went to his ear and his face turned into a snarl.

"Yea IKEA customer service, it's me again, KUNTSTORP . You guys have gone and done it now! I demand the name be changed Today, not tomorrow, not next week - TODAY."

He looked over at me with the phone still at his ear. I hadn't put the screw driver down yet. "Sorry about the mix-up... Do me a favor chief and put the coffee on - this is gonna take a while."

I turned obediently and slowly walked to the kitchen, I still could not believe what was happening. He started shouting down the phone 
"No goddammit, this is not a crank call, I don't care - send the cops over.... No don't hang up! Put me through to your line manager - I spoke with Tom on Thursday and Patricia on Monday and they know who I am! I'll teach YOU to put ME on hold!"

He was now sitting on my couch with his legs crossed and tapping his claws impatiently on the arm... 

"Hey chief, OK if I smoke in here?" He called.

He had already lit the cigarette....

"Yea... I...I guess. Do you want milk or sugar in your coffee?" I responded. He took a long drag and said "No sugar I'm sweet enough already but I'm a devil for a drop of cream". 

The irony wasn't lost on him as he sniggered while the ash fell onto my living room floor. "Hey chief, you got an ashtray laying around here ?"
