John checked his clock. It read 21:27. In just 3 minutes the group of hackers he had hired would shut down the power grid for the entire state of North Carolina. He just wished he could have done it for the entire United States, however their services were not coming cheap.

John knew that lack of perspective was behind many of the worlds greatest issues; people being overly self-important and acting in selfish ways detrimental to others. A lack of unity and solidarity between neighbours, neighbouring nations and the human race as a whole. 'If only people would realise how insignificant we truly are, tiny organisms floating through a cold and stark but also beautiful universe' james had thought in the weeks prior. It was then that this plan started to form, this stroke of genius.

He had figured that if people were not willing to travel out of cities and witness the beauty of the great expanse above and gain the self perspective that he has, then he would have to take it to them. Sure, people had seen stars before and seen the moon but the true enormity of the universe can only be appreciated when the sky is truly filled with stars. Layers upon layers of stars, hundreds, thousands, millions.

The lights of john's apartment turned off, only the glow of the lit candles remained. The clock read 21:30. He had seen the night sky countless times but never had he been as excited to see it as he was now, reaching for the door handle to his balcony.

He turned the handle and flung open the door, ready and eager to share this phenomenal view with his fellow statesmen in their various towns and cities. As he looked up his jaw dropped at the sight before him. There was nothing but cloud.
