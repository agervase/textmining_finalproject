"But...I mean, have you never had a slice of cake?"

It was a different first response. I immediately knew she had good intentions. She was like most people; curious and intrigued. But she kept asking personal questions, and less "can you punch the floor?" type requests.

She marveled at my ability to shape a lump of rock, copying her motions as she spun the clay on the wheel. But of all things, she asked me about cake first.

"Well, no. It smells amazing, but I've seen people eat it before... it's been hard enough not losing my teeth over soft foods, I don't plan on starting today."

She nodded as I spoke, but continued to work the clay. After some time, we traded bowls. I was just as unable to bend her bowl of wet clay as she was unable to bend mine of solid rock.

"So what about freezing?" she asked, examining the rock-bowl closely.

"What about it?"

"If I take a slice of moist cake, and freeze it into a block, would it be soft enough for you to eat?"

I'd been drinking ice cubes long enough to know this could work...but the thought had never crossed my mind before.

That was the time I first told her about my power. It was the first time in a long time that anyone took the time to talk to her, too. Since her family died in an accident, she really hadn't talked to anyone. 

She's a loaner now, only hangs out with me. Spends her free time here in the studio, making lord knows what out of clay. Most people describe her as "hard to talk to."

But...

It breaks my heart. She's wonderful, sweet, and doesn't think of me less as a person; she's soft towards me, and no one else.

I just wish her parents hadn't died when they hit me with their car.
