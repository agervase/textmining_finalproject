If one were to describe how I felt in the most paradoxical way, they would quote Tigger from the Winnie-the-Pooh series. "The most wonderful thing about tigggers is that I'm the only one." Except it wasn't wonderful at all.

What, you didn't expect me to know about Winnie-the-Pooh? Everyone knows about Winnie-the-Pooh. Even "closet monsters" like myself. He's universally loved by all.

For the first few years of my existence, I figured that maybe somewhere, there was someone else like me out there. As the years went by, however, I slowly began to realize that there were no other beings like myself. I was doomed to an existence all by myself... alone...

I think I snapped on the night of February 13th. All the humans were getting ready to celebrate Valentine's Day, a holiday specifically meant for the one you love. And I had nobody. The whole night, I was crying. *'How could anyone ever love me?'* I thought. *'There's nobody out there that could if they felt like it.'*

I cried myself to sleep that night.

The next day, there was a note under the door. For... me?

*Dear sir,*

*I heard you crying all night last night. I'm sorry for you, and I understand what you're going through. Sometimes it feels like nobody loves me either.*

*But just know that somewhere out there, there's someone for everyone. Because everyone deserves to be loved. Even the "monsters" in the closet.*

*I'm sure you're very nice. I want to meet you. Im sure that neither one of us wants to be alone anymore.*

*Can you come out?*

*Sincerely,*

*Vanessa*

Could it be? Someone to love ME? But... but who would even think about picking me as their loved one?

Well, there's only one way to find out.

I slowly opened the door and peeked my head out. "Hello?"

"Hey." she replied.
