"D-d-DON'T step any closer!! I s-swear to God Himself, I-I'll shoot! I'll shoot you if you do!"


"What an unsual meal," QolCanth thought to Itself. "They typically run immediately. It has to have been Quite awhile since I've fed, sure, but have the primates *Finally* grown a (somewhat quavering) spine? I wonder..."


"Can you Hear me, Apething?" It thought towards the somewhat large, albeit hairless biped in front of It. The ape had covered itself with some sort of colorful wrappings. Maybe to make up for the hair loss? To protect it from bad weather? Who knows. Apes are stupid and now they apparently don't even have proper fur. QolCanth stared, hard. "Do you feel Mine thoughts Here, Now?"


A soundless, mindless, telepathically received *SCHREECH* of Terror was the only reply. That and a sudden widening of the eyes and a quick shuffle backwards.


Qolcanth smiled at this Much more familiar reaction to His Presence and took a moment to look around. The apes had certainly been busy in It's absence. Their caves were much nicer than they used to be. More regular, more colorful, and warmer as well, although Much more fragile than they used to be. "No doubt I could tear this whole place apart with ease," It thought to Itself, as It studied the walls and wooden ceiling. 


Finally returning it's many eyed gaze to the shaking ape, now backed into a corner, QolCanth reflected on how he'd found this odd little cave so soon after Waking. After who knows Just. How. Many. YEARS of slumber, eat, feed, quest, grow bored, slumber, eat, feed, quest, etc, etc...it *Finally* looked as if something *Interesting* was happening.


Before It had bedded down the last time, the apes were still fairly hairy, they slept in real stone caves or tree hollows, and were as stupid as fish, if fish forgot how to swim. Glancing around again, QolCanth decided that Maaaybe things were different now...


"Th-that's far enough, Daemo!  I warned you once! I s-s-Shall not do it again!!" The ape in the corner sqeaked out another nonsensical verbalization, back to the wall, an odd wood and metal tube thing in it's hands, but the Meaning of it's squeaks and mews came through clear enough! It really DID think! And QolCanth could Understand it!


"ApeThing! I *Hear* you but do not hear you. I ask again. **Can you Hear me?!** Not a sound passed between them but understanding came into the ApeThing's eyes. 


A quiet thought. "y-yes. I Hear you. I Hear you in my head, yet there is silence. My ears are deaf but I Hear your questions. Oh, Merciful God, who art in Heaven, I beg of thee, Deliver me from Evil, for I am thy servant, and Yea, tho I walk through the valley of the shadow of death..."


There was more. Much more, but QolCanth tuned it out. It was clear that the apes were different now. A bit more *More.* They had Thought, now, at least. Maybe It had accidentally slumbered longer than usual. It wondered if they now tasted different as well. Really, there was only one way to find out.


"**ApeThing!! ATTEND!!!**" It Bellowed silently, it's mind and eyes entirely focused on the now kneeling creature before it. 


Immediately, the silent stream of prayers, requests, and pleading ended, interrupted, and the oddly colored cave became Truely silent once more.


The ape/meal/curiosity looked up at the many eyed horror before him, arms still raised, tube thing in hand, muscles shaking, sweat dripping, eyes no longer closed but open wide and, somehow, now, Hard. Set. As if in spite of it's obvious fear.


"NOT an ape... I am a Man! A Man of God! And I will n-n-Not bow to you, D-daemon!!," QolCanth Heard. There was no verbal sounds, despite the impression of a high pitched squeak there at the end. 


Apparently, shoulders set, the creature was beginning to Understand. An unexpected and miraculous thing in and of itself. While still acting defensively, (obviously) it was at least trying to communicate before it was devoured! Now THAT was novel! THAT was worth a pause! It had been an AWFULLY long time since It had been able to Play with It's food.


After beating out It's siblings, enemies, friends, rivals, and all other comers for this plane, this land, this world, it occurred to QolCanth that he hadn't spoken to another Truely Thinking being for... Too long. The stars weren't even the same. 


Furthermore, it occurred quite suddenly to QolCanth that Maybe, Juuuust Maybe, It might enjoy some honest and real *Company*  and *Conversation* after ALL this time!!! An opportunity for much more than a simple meal! Really, Truely, it had been Far too long since It had had Discourse! Exchange! Arguments, even! Why, physically playing with ones food was one thing. But Mentally? That was a something Much more delicious, entirely!


Lost in It's own thoughts, wondering how best to stretch things out before the Finale, so to speak, QolCanth began a slow, stately walk towards the "Manthing" now standing in the corner, arms still outstretched, shaking slightly, metal tubething in hand."


Trying to decide whether or not to first ask after the creatures fellow Manthings or about the world's current state of affairs, something amazing happened. 


Something that had never happened before.


Something that, after the initial shock and surprise wore off, rocked QolCanth to It's very core.


It *hurt.* Hurt! A lot. A LOT, a lot! "What in the **World** just happened?!?!" One second stretched for an age. Two seconds lasted forever. Sheer white pain flooded through It's being for the very first time. The world suddenly went dark and then red. Bright. And everything was excruciating beyond words or even Thoughts. QolCanth *SCREAMED...*


...



Klaus held the wheellock aloft, his quivering arms aching with the weight of it. His silent prayers were once again interrupted by that malignant Presence in his mind, a whispered evil that his ears did Not hear but definitely was There, nonetheless.


"NOT an ape," he loudly thought, but didn't say aloud... "I am a Man! A Man of God!" His fervor peaked without concious thought as he delved back into prayer and asked for strength. 


The Daemon horror blocking off all exit was now shuffling forward again, despite his earlier threats and the strange but Certain conviction that the creature had *Understood him.*


Very well. God Save Him, but he would fight the Devil in his own home. So be it!


Taking a better grip to steady the wheellock pistol that he'd only recently aquired, Klaus offered up another quick prayer before sighting down the barrel one last time.


At almost point blank range, he slowly pulled the trigger while burying
his fear at the Daemons approach. The towering monstrosity before him was unlike anything he'd ever seen, even in his nightmares, but eyes are usually located in the head and this thing had more than a few of those. 


Klaus aimed. The hammer fell. And then his mind shattered, as the pistols blast gave way to a silent screech that pireced his mind like an ice pick, like a lighting bolt. The pain of that unearthlyscream inside his head, so hot and white and unbearable, was more that he could bear. More than Anyone could bear!


Klaus crashed to his knees, his hands uselessly pressed to his ears for 3 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, an eternity, until finally, mercifully, he passed out from the pain of it.


...


It was the silence that finally woke him. True, real, worldly silence. Klaus sat up, his mind clear once more. Mere paces away lay the Daemon, facedown and unmoving. 


Scrambling to his feet, Klaus backed away some more, blindly grabbing for his ammo pouch while his eyes remained locked upon the Best. It didn't move. 


Automatically, his hands reloaded and primed the Wheelock once more. That finished, he waited some minutes more and watched closely for any signs of life or breathing or movement. There was none. 



Circling to the side and moving closer with weapon in hand, Klaus could now see the creature more clearly. It's head, if it was the head, was now missing some eyes. And a large hole bore straight through the one side. There was still no movement.


Emboldened by this, Klaus walked even closer, right up to the bleeding form, and knelt for a closer inspection, and that's when he finally saw it. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the seeping wound was closing. Second by second, the greenish red blood slowed, slowed, slowed...stopped. 


Another minute passed and, was he crazy or was the hole slightly smaller than before? He watched...


No, it was definitely closing. Growing fractionally smaller with each minute. Healing.


A gasp escaped his throat as Klaus realized the implications. The Daemon was dead! Half of It's face had been utterly destroyed! The back of It's ugly head blown out, a gaping hole! And yet, he couldn't ignore his eyes, as much as his mind and soul railed against them. 


Slipping back into mumbled prayer, Klaus straightened up once more and took a step away. He raised the Wheelock and sighted carefully. At this distance, a miss would be impossible. His trembling finger found the trigger and he calmed himself with a deep breath.


"Return thee now to Hell, from whence ye came, Daemon. Return thee, and burn forevermore!" He squeezed the trigger, absorbing the recoil, and reloaded again. He aimed. He fired. Reload. Aim. Fire. Reload. Again.


 Again. 


Again.
