"Where are you!?" His voice carried down the rotting stairs and cobwebs.

As I came through the portal,  the girl held fast to the blade that had summoned me. She winced at the smell of sulfur, and the burn of freshly cut skin. Yet the terror in her eyes was not on my account. 

As protocol dictates I announced myself, asking her what her purpose was on summoning a demon from the depths of the abyss. A tear ran down her bruised cheek, "He won't stop until I'm dead. Please, God doesn't answer my prayers."

In my head, the thought made me chuckle. Though I was fully aware that the man upstairs, both literally and spiritually, were numb to her cries of mercy. I took her face in my hands. It is much easier with the young, they have no preconceptions about what forms we take. A simple shade or voice tends to be the extent of our manifestations. Yet this one, this girl child with dark hair and light behind her broken spirit,  moved me. 

When I saw what had been done to her. I never felt more comfortable with myself.  I was never as depraved as the monster that is mankind. This man was the worst I had ever seen. True evil, not born of God nor the devil. Soulless and cruel.  

As I saw each deed be done to her, my rage grew. Perhaps this was a test. My punishment finally paid for my own sins. I smiled down to her, though she could not see me. In time she would forget that I was real. I note her call only as a clerical error in Hell's broken bureaucracy. What she will remember, is the man she knew as her father, falling headfirst down the basement stairs.  A massive heart attack is what the coroner will say. For the girl child is free of the true evil in her life.  
As I depart, the doorbell rings. Maybe I'm due for my wings after all?
