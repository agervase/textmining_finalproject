Dear Temptress,

My wife and I are huge fans of your column! We hope you can help us with our problem.

When the war happened and our great leader won (Praise be to Dr. Von Doomgod and his forces may his reign last for a million year) my two sons were 10 and newborn. When my oldest was 15 he got it into his fool head that he was suppose to be some kind of "savior" and tried to "bring freedom" to our sector. I tried to tell him that he was crazy but also being a firm believer of "got to learn the hard way" my son went out to fight our sector's war lord, The Devastator. Long story short my oldest was beaten to a pulp and had his legs torn off for good measure. That got that whole "Chosen One" nonsense out of his head!

Now my youngest is 13 and he is also gotten it in his head that he is destined to lead the people into revolt or something. I love my son and I rather not have him be legless since harvest season is coming up! What can a poor father do?

Dear Desperate,

First off, glad you and your wife are big fans! As you know I own several homes and businesses in Sector 17!

Well, about the problem at hand... Really there is nothing wrong with the "tough love" method of raising a child. Hell if my step father didn't beat me and whore me out I would have never triggered my powers and been able to be the beautiful villain and goddess that you and others worship! But I can see that having to care for two legless teens might be a bit of a strain. There are a number of things you could try to maybe prevent the loss of limbs:

* Beat the boy yourself! It might not be the thrashing your oldest got from Devastator but could show him the light!

* Drugs! Either prescription or illegal. Kind of hard to be all high and mighty if your have an addiction to something. Then again this could also cause more thoughts of being a hero depending on the drug (DO NOT USE PCP!)

* Enroll him into a street gang or criminal union. Nothing wrong with getting his hands dirty! Hell I myself am always looking for yummy young blood for my many "relaxation centers". Maybe getting laid by yours truly or one of my many hot friends will knock those thoughts out of his head!

* If all else fails, report him to a detention center. I know that would be the worse case thing to do but what sounds better for your boy, being an limbless torso or being alive but serving hard time on the prison moon of Arkon 5?

I hope I am able to help you... shoot me a pic of him and I will be more than happy to pick him up and put him into my program!

Hugs and kisses from your goddess,
-The Temptress
