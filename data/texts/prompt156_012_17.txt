Commander Jean Acosta was finally prepared to die.

&#x200B;

It had taken nearly 30 hours of failure, diagnostics, clean reports, and even more inexplicable failure for her to face the reality that she was never going to get home, and that nobody at home was ever going to know where she had died. It was a suffocating, deafening realization that threatened to shoved her down into the corners of her seat.

&#x200B;

*No. NO.* Jean shoved the rising horror back down into her gut with all the force she could muster. *I'm still a goddamn astronaut.* For the first time in hours, she got up from her chair and peered out the small porthole window. Inky blackness stared back her, with not even a hint of stars to soften its gaze. She knew the FTL drive was profoundly experimental, but the idea that it could have thrown her beyond even the reach of distant starlight filled her with amazement and horror in turns. She glanced again at the atmospheric sensor display. It fluctuated, numbers seemingly generated at random. It wasn't even sure if there was vacuum outside. 

&#x200B;

Jean sighed, and the steeled herself. *Time to take in the view*. With a gloved hand, she initialed cycling the door. The *Phoenix* wasn't big enough for a proper airlock. Opening the door required depressurizing the entire cabin.  

&#x200B;

The mission had gone so well up till now. The launch from Biakonur had fallen on a clear, calm day, and the Falcon XII had passed all checks with aplomb. Even the docking with the *Phoenix* had been flawless. Then came the real test. Nobody knew exactly what to expect with the FTL drive. Trail flights had shown it worked, and animal testing had proven it physically safe, but no one knew what it would *feel* like. Jean snorted at the thought. *Feels like getting drunk, expect the alcohol is being poored directly onto your brain with a fire hose.* Her head still hurt from the experience; a dull rhythmic pounding that almost sounded melodic if you let yourself wallow in it for too long. 

&#x200B;

The door light switched to bright green, cheerily inviting Jean to open the door. She checked her tether,  then grabbed the handle, and despite the space suit protecting her, held her breath as she opened the door and stepped gingerly into the darkness.

&#x200B;

And promptly hit her head on the wall.

&#x200B;

For a brief moment, Jean was so startled that she just stayed as she was, arms at her sides, face pressed against the visor of her helmet like a child squishing their face against the window of a bus. It was definitely a wall. And not just a wall, a floor too. With gravity. Jean slowly righted herself, a difficult task in the bulky spacesuit. Back on her two feet, she tried jumping and found about the same success she would expect to find in a spacesuit on Earth. Confused, she turned and stepped back into the *Phoenix* and nearly threw herself into the far wall in the sudden weightlessness. *Holy shit. localized gravity!* 

&#x200B;

Back outside of the *Phoenix*, Jean examined the inexplicable surface. Or tried to. Truth be told, she still couldn't see it. It was smooth and hard like polished stone, that much she could feel, but beyond that there wasn't much she could ascertain. The surface itself seemed to devour light to the point of invisibility. Staring at it gave her a strange sense of vertigo. After feeling around, she concluded that the wall was mostly flat, angled at about eighty degrees, and about a meter from the hull of her ship, as if someone had parked the *Phoenix* in a corner like an old car in a basement garage. The floor was much the same. Jean spooled out the tether a bit further, and began to move around the back of her little bullet shaped ship, wincing as her headache changed rhythm as if to tell her this was a bad idea.

&#x200B;

As Jean rounded the rear of the Phoenix, she discovered that the ship was indeed parked in a corner of sorts, with the back even closer to a wall than the door side. With some effort and a grunt, she squeezed through, glad that she wasn't wearing the bulky nightmares astronauts of ages past had been saddled with. Finally free of the wall, she stood, and nearly fainted.

&#x200B;

On the far side of the ship were three vaguely humanoid figures, two of the crouched, clearly examining the *Phoenix*, with the third standing back, appearing to operate a powerful spotlight. Despite the light's brightness, the figures appeared to be standing on nothingness, even their spotlight apparently unable to illuminate the bizarre surface. Jean held perfectly still, desperately trying to recall first contact training. The furthest of the creatures examining her ship looked her direction, and then froze.

&#x200B;

*"HOLY FUCK,"* cried her headache.

&#x200B;

Jean winced in pain, and put her hands to her head. Her moment spurred the creatures to action. The spotlight that had been directed at the *Phoenix* was now pointed at her, the automatic glare dampening of her visor helpfully saving her eyesight but also obscuring the creatures. Unable to see, she raised her hands in a gesture of surrender.

&#x200B;

*"ITS CASTING!"* screamed her headache. 

&#x200B;

"What?" Jean sputtered, "no, I'm . . . agh, no." The pain made formulating a sentence like trying to play Scrabble in a wave pool. Her next attempt came out mostly as a moan.

&#x200B;

*"IT ISN'T CASTING, IT'S IN PAIN YOU FOOL*," her headache roared. Then the room tilted, and Jean's mind went as dark as the floor she landed on.
