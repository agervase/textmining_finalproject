I woke up on the living room floor infront of the fire place in my shorts, my body covered in paint AGAINN. This was not the first time it had happened and i knew that when i would walk into my study i would be confronted with another weird painting, at first my blackouts scared me, then i started enjoying them because to be honest my art career had taken a bit of a dive and these artworks even though extremely weird and scary to me, were attracting more attention than any of my masterpieces had done before.
I walked into my study and this time a loud gasp escaped my lips, the painting this time was extremely disturbing, dont get me wrong the other 'killings' paintings were disturbing but for some reason this painting hit a nerve, there was a strange familiarity of the beautiful but beheaded head at the bottom of the painting and i swear i had seen that small tattoo on top of her right breast before, it was barely visible from the torture and viciousness this poor girl had endured through but even though the torture was emphasized it was as if i tried to emphasize that particular detail even more. This painting was more vivid than the others i had to sit and calm down, for some reason i was suffering from a shortness of breath. I was analyzing the painting when suddenly i noticed something which i would have never noticed if i had been standing, sitting down looking at it from an angle i noticed a 2nd layer on top of the painting, an untrained eye would have missed it but to me it was as bright as day. A quick analysis and i had found a chilling message in the painting which could have only been for me, i left the room unable to look at the painting and headed straight to the kitchen.
4 hours, 2 packs of marlboro and a bottle of jack later i still didnt know what to make of the message "you enjoyed her last year on this day, i enjoyed her today, we are similar my friend you and i, we both made her scream thats for sure..... sorry for the obvious message this time but its 12-0 to me its time you started to participate in my game dear friend...." .............
