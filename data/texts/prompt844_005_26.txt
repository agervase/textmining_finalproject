The usual coffee stain hung to my shirt. Another regular day. The spider's door stood at the end of the corridor, eager to be opened. I stopped briefly to watch the seamless night. To breathe in its peaceful silence. Another day. I sighed, then turned the door's golden knob. Its hinges grated as I pushed it open. I should oil them up.

"I see you've chosen an eerie setting today," I said, forcing the joy out the void I felt inside.

Filyrass, the spider, enjoyed spending her time arranging her room into different themes. Judging for the weak oil lantern awaiting for me among the shadows and the lack of answer, she was feeling mischievous today. I fought against her massive webs, advancing toward the lantern and sputtering when they got into my mouth. 

The rattling of Filyrass' thick legs echoed in the chamber. I decided to play along. I quickened my breathing, and forced myself to tremble.

*You sure you wanna get to the light?* A soft yet mysterious voice asked in my head.

"I-I m-must. It's the only way," I stammered.

*The only way? To what would that be?*

"To burn the face off of my fate." I sprung toward the lantern, tearing apart the wall of webs. I broke the glass against my knee, sending shard flying to the sides, and set the webs aflame.

Strings of fire started to burn in a chain reaction, illuminating the entire chamber. Flames dripped from them, fading before touching the stone ground. Filyrass' rattling noises quickened, but her enormous figure couldn't escape the light. She stared at me with those voids she had for eyes, and came to halt.

*Yes! Amazing session today. Thank you very much, Robert. Always doing the unexpected.* She chuckled, and proceeded to feast on the fire. *Good luck with Old Virila.*

"Sure thing, Filyrass," I said and walked toward the next door. "You got me this time. I was trembling like a kid after a nightmare."

*I saw it. It was delicious. Hey, do you enjoy tea?*

"I do, green is my favorite." I turned the door's knob. "Tea party tomorrow?"

*Maybe.*

"I will bring the sugar. Fleas are not my favorite spice," I said and shut Filyrass' door. Then, I walked across another alley toward Virila's room. She would be happy today, I got her the tears of my nephew as she requested.
