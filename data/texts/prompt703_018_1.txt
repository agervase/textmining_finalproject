She was my best friend.

When I heard the news about the accident, I was devastated. [Kaori](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9g4dpb/wp_you_lived_your_life_hopelessly_in_love_with/e625pei/) was my oldest and dearest friend, and... I never had the opportunity to *tell* her how I felt about her. Sure, we've had dinner together quite a few times, but...

...I was never much of a religious person. Prayer was never something I did when I was growing up, but I couldn't help but do so that night. The ancestors, all of the kami, Buddha, anyone who was listening. I would do anything to see Kaori again, to tell her I loved her. I wanted to see her again.

I guess someone really *was* listening. I went to sleep in my apartment, but I woke up in a strange room. There were no walls, only a solid gray floor surrounded by a fog-shrouded black void. Nothing else was around; just myself and this strange room.

At least I could still walk, but where? I couldn't see anything past thirty feet or so, and all I had were my pajamas. I didn't go to sleep with anything in my pockets.

"Souji!"

I stopped. It was impossible. But that voice...

I turned around.

And I was face-to-face with stormy gray eyes I thought I would never see again. A messy black ponytail that bobbed back and forth as I felt a pair of strong arms wrap around me.

"Kaori, you're... you're alive?" I asked, surprised. I returned her hug, still not entirely sure if I was embracing a ghost.

"I... I don't know. I remember pushing that little girl out of the way," Kaori replied. "And the last thing I saw was the bus, almost on top of me... oh, God..."

"Kaori, how long have you been here?" I asked her. "I heard about what happened last night..."

"'Last night?' Souji, I just got here." Kaori looked up at me, and I could see some confusion in her eyes. "And you got here about a second after I did. ...This is my fault."

"No, it's nobody's fault--"

"Yeah. It is. Souji, look, I... I'm sorry. I'm *so* sorry. You should have had a full life..."

"'Full life?' You should have had a full life, too, Kaori."

Kaori was about to say something to me, but we were interrupted by a quiet, gentle voice clearing itself. Looking over Kaori's shoulder, [a black-haired woman in a dark gray hoodie was watching us, sadness in her sky-blue eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/55gme5/wp_while_walking_you_notice_everyone_recoiling/d8ajyca/).

"H-hello," I said. "Are you... did you...?"

"No," the woman replied. There was a timidness in her voice that seemed natural.

"Who are you?" Kaori asked. "Wait... never mind. I think I know."

"You're correct. Kaori Nakagaki, Souji Kumada, I... am Death." The  young woman took a tablet out of her hoodie's pocket, then looked it over, flicking the screen every so often. "Kaori Nakagaki, born June 22, 1997, passed away May 27, 2018. Left behind a grieving mother, an absent father, and a devastated best friend."

"So I really *am* dead..." Kaori said, her usually-calm voice downcast.

"As for you..." More flicking and movement on Death's screen. "Souji Kumada, born October 22, 1997. .....Strange. Your time has not yet come, yet you are here." Death looked at me, as if trying to figure out what had happened. If she was looking at me for answers, I was as clueless as she was.

"Yes. Now I recall. It is a right that humans, upon their passing, have to challenge me to a contest. Should they best me, they are granted a second chance at life," Death continued. "Most humans prefer chess, or a game of cards, but... Miss Nakagaki had a most unusual request."

That was definitely Kaori-- she would always surprise me with something unusual growing up. She looked sheepishly at me, apologizing again.

"I don't get it. If Kaori challenged you, then why bring me here?" I asked Death.

"....I'm sorry. I'm *so* sorry," Death told me. "Miss Nakagaki's choice of challenge was something called *Mille Bornes.* Specifically, the two-versus-two team rules."

"Souji, if I knew I was gonna drag you into this, I would have said something different!" Kaori said. "I don't know, something like Smash Bros. or mini-golf or a plain old honest-to-God iaijutsu duel!"

"...since when do you know how to use a katana?" I wondered.

"*I* ***don't!***"

"Nor do I. Now, the challenge has been issued by Miss Nakagaki. *Mille Bornes,* team play. The first team to five thousand points shall be the victor."

"Just curious, before we begin," I said. "Out of everyone on Earth, Kaori could have had anyone for her partner. Why me?"

"Because you're my best friend," Kaori replied. "That was kinda obvious, you dumbass."

"It's not just that. Miss Nakagaki deserves the best possible partner in her battle for her second chance. She deserves the second half of her soul. I believe the proper phrase is... 'soulmate.'"

I could feel myself blushing; Kaori, usually so confident in everything she did, glanced at me, before quickly averting her gaze. I could see red creeping up into her cheeks.

She and I were probably going to have to have a really long talk about this once this was over.

"Now then. Should your team be victorious, Miss Nakagaki's life will be restored to her. The bus will be too close for comfort, but she will live. Should my team be victorious..."

"What team? I don't care if it's against Death, two-on-one's still unfair," Kaori said.

"You are right. Allow me to introduce my play partner."

Death nodded; a pillar of flame erupted in the small room, and once it had cleared, [an impossibly-beautiful red-haired woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4io63l/wp_a_man_tries_to_sell_his_soul_satan_to_get_a/d32fwli/) stood in its place. She smiled at us, then turned to Death, red nails drumming against her hip.

"Death! Good to see you!" the redhead cried, smiling broadly. "How's the boyfriend?"

"Matthew is *not* my boyfriend. It's... it's more complicated than that," Death replied. I couldn't help but think her words were an apt description of my friendship with Kaori. "How is your husband, Lucille?"

"Just 'Lucy.' And he's really getting into the whole King of Hell thing! Just last week, he took a whole bunch of actual Nazis, and--"

"I'm sure our guests don't wish to hear about that," Death (tactfully) interrupted. "They're here for the game."

"Oh, yeah, that! You know the rules, kiddos!" Lucy said. "You two win, you lovebirds get to go back to Earth and deal with this whole awkward 'I want more from this friendship but I don't want to lose my best friend' thing you've got going on. Probably with lots of fucking. But if Death and I win..."

Lucy's grin suddenly seemed to resemble a hangman's as she leered at us. Her "...*your asses are* ***MINE.***" was practically a snarl befitting the Queen of Hell.

"Now then, the stakes are made," Death added. "Have we a deal?"

Next to me, Kaori nodded. I hadn't noticed, but sometime during our conversation, her hand found its way into mine. I wasn't sure who took whose hand, but I could feel her fingers lace around mine. It was her subtle way of telling me that she had my back.

I nodded; after all, she's always had my back, and I've always had hers. We've been through far worse in our short lives. One card game against Death and the Devil was practically nothing.
