*A Dungeon Master, A Ranger, A Warlock and a Barbarian sit at a kitchen table.*

**Dungeon Master**:  Alright, just so everybody's all caught up, could somebody describe what happened during our last campaign.

**Ranger:**  Well, we're just about to fight the British while they're busy fighting in World War One.  Therefore, we will make Ireland a free state. We're waiting for weapons to come in from Germany and we have successfully convinced MacNeill to join us thanks to a forged letter.

*Barbarian rises from his chair and plants his hands palm down on the table in anticipation*

**Barbarian:**  What are we waiting for? Let's get started!

**DM:**  You sure you don't want to wait for your weapons yet?

**Warlock:**  Yeah, that's probably best.  So, what's happening?

*Dungeon Master roles a D20.  \[8\]*

**DM:**  Oh no.  Unfortunately, British spies have gathered intelligence of the boat that was smuggling your weapons.  All weapons have been confiscated been confiscated.

**Ranger:**  Crap.  Did the crew make it?

*Dungeon Master roles a D20.  \[3\]*

*Dungeon Master shakes his head*

**Ranger:**  Well, there goes all my favourite NPCs.

**Warlock:**  We don't need weapons.  Once we have the reinforcements, we'll manage.

**DM:**  Um, yeah.  About that...  At the end of our last session, MacNeill caught wind of the forged letter and backed out of the rising.

**Barb:**  Oh come on!  This is completely unfair.

**DM:**  It's not my fault!  He get a natural twenty on perception!

**Barb:**  So what *do* we have to start the Rising?

**DM:**  Well, you can still go on with the battle, though I suggest you take a little more time to\-

**Warlock:**  We'll do it tomorrow.

**DM:**  What!?!

**Warlock:**  Let's go tomorrow.  They won't expect it.

**DM:**  But you guys are woefully unprepared!

**Barb:**  Well, we already committed to all this planning.

**DM**:  What planning?  This is our third session and so far everything you've planned has failed.

**Barb:**  Won't stop me.  Save nothing for the swim back, and all that.

**Ranger:**  Well, I suppose they already know about our weapon smuggling...

**DM:**  Alright, fine!  We'll start the next day.  But first you have to capture some headquarters.  You need a base during all this.

**Ranger:**  Okay, I'll take the GPO.

*Ranger roles a D20.  \[17\]*

**DM:**  Alright, that's a success. Anything else.

**Warlock:**  I want to take the Jacob's Factory.

**DM:**  The biscuit factory?

**Warlock:**  Yeah!  Seems reasonable.

*Dungeon Master ponders briefly.  His eyes dart back and forth as he juggles the allowance of this request*

**DM:**  I'll allow it.

*Warlock roles a D20.  \[19\]*

**Warlock:**  Get done!

**DM:**  I will allow one more building to be taken.  What's your pick, Barbarian?

**Barb:**  I want The Four Courts.

**DM:**  Um... Sure?

*Barbarian roles a D20.  \[12\]*

**DM:**  Okay.

**Barb:**  I also have plus five against courts.

**DM:**  Okay.  It's a win either way.

*Barbarian lies back in the chair, his hands cradling the back of his head in pride.*

**Barb:**  Like a champ.

**DM:**  You guys do realise you *only* picked buildings in the middle of the city.

**Warlock:**  So?

**DM:**  So you can easily be surrounded.

**Warlock:**  But we still have the numbers.

**DM:**  You're outnumbered twenty to one.

**Warlock:**  I never said they were *good* numbers.

*Dungeon Master drops his head in defeat*

**DM:**  I'm guessing none of you are backing out of this obviously uphill battle.

**Ranger, Warlock and Barb in unison:**  Nope!

**Barb:**  The freedom of Ireland depends on it!

*Dungeon Master exhales impatiently.*

**DM:**  Alright.  Prepare for the shortest campaign of your lives.

**Ranger:**  Ah, I'm sure we'll all be fine.  Once we're not up against a warship or anything.

*Dungeon Master thinks momentarily then displays a vindictive grin.  He roles a D20.  \[20\].*

**Barb:**  What was that?

**DM:**  Oh, nothing.
