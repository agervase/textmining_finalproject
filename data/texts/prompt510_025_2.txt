The rain came down in the thick kind of nearly sideways sheets that made people surrender to being wet. Flickering neon lights lit alleyways where recombiners offered to fix memories and petty hustlers tried to sell pretty, real flesh; their eyes glazed over from whatever new synthetic smuggled from the less law abiding edges of Laniakea, their quivering lips betraying their faces' porcelain smooth demeanor. 

As one opened their mouth, shadowed by a dark figure all silvered teeth and eyes, I ducked before an offer could be made, weaving through the press of bodies, the doldrum that had accepted the lazily flying palaces above were only for temporary respite from the weather, and that looking up was akin to imagining being in one of the dizzyingly tall ivory towers they scraped by. 

I knew better: as above, so below.

The Funded lived just as miserably in their habitats, disconnected from each other, the world, reality. Looking up at the Rings the way pedestrians looked at their towers and Vimanas. Calling a two-bit schmuck like me occasionally to clean up a mess of theirs, or find the source of mess (that invariably circled back to another Funded), or, rarely, create a mess at their behest. This world world was a mess, top to bottom, and no amount of glitz, gloss, or glam could polish this lump of shit enough to hide its stink. 

My muted tulpa broke so many protocols right then that half my mind had it in the recycling bin before I noticed her. It was as though the sea of destitute had parted and I was Moses, her my promised land â€”

"If you would stop monologuing for just one fucking second, there is something seriously not right-"

"What's not right is you overriding eight security layers." Maxximus was prone to paranoia, and overthinking, and overtalking.

"Nononononononononono," the son of a bitch overrode my mute, and went visual; a purple, muscled head of too many teeth and eyes far too slanted popping up in my periphery. "This is different, I can feel -"

"Her..." I finished his words as I stopped walking, locking eyes with an absolutely divine vision of a woman. She seemed untouched by the rain, as if it had just sizzled off of her aura before it had a chance to touch her perfect mocha skin. I was left speechless, even as Maxx's increasingly desperate and angry attempts to speak faded off into wherever tulpas went when not welcome.

She shocked me by reaching out. With her voice.

"You're funny." She said, her voice sounded of ash and lilacs; the kind of voice that would silence a man's heart and he would thank her for the pleasure.

"And you're beautiful," I said with a sincerity I thought I had lost in a previous century. It left a mild shock that brought me back, had me noticing the alleys with the silvered eyes, the hushed comms probing; I'm slipping not to have noticed so many gates simultaneously preparing for war. I glanced quickly to where the dame with the porcelain face had been, and saw nothing but silvered teeth.

"Don't worry about them. They see what they want to see; they see what I am." She said, walking towards me even as my own feet had become cement. Maxx popped out from some shop's projector array, but she waved him away so easily you would never believe he was a top dollar tulpa even the Funded envied.

I tried to reach out with my comms, as my lips had suddenly left me. There was nothing. And everything. I probed: *Who are you...?*


And she rellied, ***Not who, but what.*** Now she stood so close the rain couldn't wash out her fragrance.  She was standing no more than a foot away from me. ***I am the end, and the woman that will kill you.*** 

"But you can call me Death." The beautiful smell of ash and lilacs filled my nostrils even as Maxx howled in my subconscious. I didn't think I was eager to die, but I knew I'd thank her for the pleasure.
