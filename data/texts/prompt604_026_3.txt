I'd nearly managed to get away with it. Nearly. No one had suspected anything, besides maybe the usual holy hardiness. Right up until my head came off.

I sat there, introduced to the unforgettable taste of bloodied sand as I listened to the crowd roar their approval, waiting for my body to slump down into an ignoble heap with the others, so that Horus' champion could claim his victory.

While they started to wonder what was taking so long, I began fumbling through the arena sand, blindly groping for a familiar landmark to orient myself. By the time I found Bjorn's war hammer, the crowd had grown quiet enough that I could hear the murmurs, the spreading discontent. I followed along the blunt weapon, and from there it was just a bit of guess-work before I felt my own finger tips at the back of my hair. 

I hoisted myself up for a better view. Tarik was arguing with a judge, waving his still bloody khopesh about like that helped make his point. The God-Gallery looked pretty blatantly enraged too, arguing and bickering with one another about who would dare bend the spirit (if maybe not the letter) of the rules to this extent. 

The Gods up there weren't my issue though. I turned (Well, angled my dangling head) to the gaunt woman marching the edges of the arena, jotting down the names of the Departed in her neat little ledger. With wide eyes, I hoped for some salvation from my patron. 

Foolish of me, I know. She wasn't exactly famed for her rescues, was she? She shrugged at me, before returning to her work, consigning row after row of names into her book.

I paused for the briefest of moments, before swapping my head to my off-hand, and reaching down to take up my sword once again. Dying, surviving, all that could wait.

Right now, I still needed to win.
