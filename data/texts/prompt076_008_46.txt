A rebuttal of a rebuttal, with a continuance. 

What a long day.


Of course, funerals do that to you. The cold wet ground. Acting as if remorse is felt, when much of it left, long ago. Two and a half years. That's how long it had been. Barry wasn't the best husband but he had been one, as if that was enough. For years, he fooled our son into thinking the existence of Hogwarts was real. To be fair though, he had went to great lengths to make it seem true. At least he had done that much. I told him often how he needed to tell our son the truth. Some kids grow up believing in Santa, some grow up believing all manner of else. He just had to make our son feel special in that way though. An impossible way. 


What would have happened if he had lived? Would he grow up believing life was a lie? Failing to believe in anything, because the one thing he truly believed was torn away? Or would he have grown from it. I'm unsure, but sitting here, looking at his father's grave, right beside his, I feel nothing. No, that's not entirely true. I feel as if I am being watched. The hairs standing up on my neck, as if a cold hand had just brushed along it. But who would be watching now? The funeral was over hours ago. So I steel my heart, and turn around. Off in the distance, beyond the spiked fence then encased the cemetery, a lone figure darts quickly behind cover. But just for a moment, I felt I could clearly make out their features. They felt somehow familiar. As if I knew them. Did I know them?


Hours later, trying to sleep, yet fruitless in my endeavors, I sit up quickly, with a start.


"Barry!?"
