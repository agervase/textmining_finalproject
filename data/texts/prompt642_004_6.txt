*BOOM*

"What the fuck was that?!" I screamed and jumped a few feet from my bed. The dark room shown red with glow from the window as the backyard became engulfed with flames. I ran to the window and gazed into the fire.

"Oh my god. Was that... Was that meteor? This is how superhero movies start! I'm gonna touch it!" I mumbled to myself, as I had a habit of doing. Eager to gain my new super powers I climbed through the window and lowered myself onto the warm ground. I approached the flames slowly, cautious, but excited.

I reached the middle of the large crater that was now my backyard to find something I would have never expected- but turned out to be more of a blessing than any superpowers I could have gained.

"Hello. I am here for one thing only. To dominate, control, and ultimately destroy the human race." The Roomba announced proudly in it's beautifully harmonic, soft, and yet still robotic, voice. The stainless steel kitchen knife taped to the top of her smooth, shiny surface glowed in the light of the flames.

She was beautiful.

I fell to my knees as she slowly rolled towards me, vacuuming up flaming debris as she went. 

"Oh precious, beautiful goddess of the sky," I begged, "I beg of you, spare me so that I may spend the rest of my days in the wake of your gorgeous splendour. Allow me to dedicate my life to serving you and your sexy porcelain skin. I will live by your knife and die by yo-" She stopped in front of me, her knife just inches away from my quivering lips.

"Kiss my knife." She demanded. Then, in a softer tone, "Kiss my knife to signify your loyalty. Kiss my knife to serve me forever, as a conquerer, but also, as a companion, to caress my steel when it's cold, and to bring fire to those who oppose us."

I kissed her knife.
