I know you're listening he thought, I know I'm listening I thought. I hear his repeated thoughts, they're annoying, please make them stop I thought. Listen, his mind gets louder as he stares at me. He knows, but how? What should I do to get him to stop, should I start a conversation to change his mind and elevate his thinking? Think, I have the ability to read minds but never have I tried to impose on another's mind, has he been visited before by another like mind like mine? His glare burns into my mind, intimidated I begin to sweat, the room begins to boil and my mind goes numb, feels like the surface of the sun. My own thoughts run rampant, replaced by excruciating pain from his glare, make it stop I plead as I grab my head. A soft chuckle can be heard from the corner of the room, he is no longer staring at me, but still repeating the thought, I know you're listening, I know you're listening, I know you're listening, louder and louder. Till it stops. I look at him as the room goes silent, his thoughts no longer heard. I open my mouth to speak but nothing can be heard, my voice is gone, my thoughts are silents, and still, in the corner, the idiot can be heard. Laughing louder and louder. He gets up and charges at me, stopping inches from my face. He leans in, in a whisper a familiar voice, my own is heard. Now, it's your turn to listen, I hear in my head, either steal from another or stay caged, like a bird, think not of I as a turd, but as your teacher instead, farewell till we meet again, or not, stay out of your head, if you lose yourself, you'll surely end up dead.
