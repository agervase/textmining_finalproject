“Sarah.” That was the first thought in my head as I woke up. The name meant nothing.


I found myself sitting in a stiff chair, my body seemingly refused to move. After a bit of anxiety I heard a few cracks, more satisfying than worrying.


Slowly but surely I began to shift as I noticed my hands.


Thin, frail, and slightly transparent to the point where I could see my veins.


Wrinkly too now that I thought about it. Lifting up my hand I found that they were unsteady, shaking. I tried to steady myself through great effort but could not find the energy to do so.


Then I felt something on my finger, a small impact. Not painful, just noticeable. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust. There was something there, clear and white.

It was water I quickly realised, white due to the reflections from the florescent bulbs above me.
Another drop of water joined it. I was crying?

Wiping away my tears I felt a heavy build-up of crust. I must’ve been crying for quite some time to get to this point. Why was I crying?

I took another look at my surroundings.
The stiff chair, the florescent lights, white floors and pristine walls. I was in some sort of waiting room. Where was I? How did I get here?
I can’t seem to remember anything. 


My thoughts were interrupted by some noise, I hadn’t noticed it before but it was something that had been building up steadily.

Footsteps along with hushed but excited words.


A group of men and women in white uniforms appeared before me coming around the corner with measured haste.


“Sir!” One of them excitingly began speaking to me. “Your wife Sarah, she’s going to be okay! It’s a miracle!”


There was that name again… Sarah, what did it mean?
