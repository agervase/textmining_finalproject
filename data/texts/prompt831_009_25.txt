In the fire were the last remnants of my plan. The plans to finish what I had started. I dismissed my minions to finish my last orders to deliver the basilisk venom antidotes and cleared the traps on my way to the throne room. The only thing to do now is wait. 

The echo of metal foot steps in the distance reverberated in my ears. Against the wall in the corridor outside of my chamber, is the silhouette of the one I've been waiting to seek me out.

"Your deeds have brought my blade to your door, the spread of your darkness ends here!", called the silhouette from the door. 

Looking up I could see the fair knight with her radiant armor and flowing brown hair. She advanced towards my position at a slow pace, scanning the room for surprises. I'm sure it must be confusing to advance through the tower of the tyrant terrorizing the local towns to find it empty. No resistance, just open doors and passages.

"I'm ready for whatever trap you have ready. The families of those you have poisoned are recovering, and I will make sure you are not around to threaten them again.", taunted the lady knight continuing her advance.

I have waited years for her to take notice. Each deed required more and more threat until I was known far enough away that someone paid for my life to be snuffed out. I had to make sure that none other than her could take that call.

The steps stopped. A short metal clang later and the point of a sharp blade was leveled at me.

The darkness has faded from my mind as I stare at her shadow. 

"Any final words?", she asked, raising her sword into the air.

I looked up, directly into her eyes. A tear left my eye. The knight flinched, possibly unsettled by the sight. In a zealous fury her resolve rekindled and in the next instant a cold feeling pierced my chest. 

Falling to my knees, my gaze never leaving hers. This is it... this is my only chance.

"I love you."
