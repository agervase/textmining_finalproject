Everything was white. The first thing I noticed when I awoke was how bright the ceiling was. Then the pain set in. Gasping in shock, I jolted up. Only, my body didn’t move because I was in a full body cast. The reflexive response only served to cause a tsunami of pain roll through my body, emanating from the lower back area. If my toes could have curled, they would have.

After the sharp pain resolved into a dull throbbing ache, I realized my head felt like a leaden anvil that had just been hammered a thousand times. Except, anvils only got hammered from one direction while my head felt like it had been abused from every conceivable angle.

“What…happened?” I thought as I blearily blinked, trying to focus as I struggled to collect the debris of my scattered mind.

With my head completely wrapped and a neck brace restricting my head movement, not that I wanted to move my head, really, I could only stare up at the excessively pale ceiling. Strangely, I couldn’t hear any sound except for a dim ringing sound.

“Ok. So. Fully body cast and garish lighting. Obviously, I'm in a hospital.” My mind slowly pieced together the available information. Yea, you couldn’t mistake the harsh overbearing odor of aggressively applied disinfectants and cleaning solution attempting to mask the underlying mixed smell of blood, urine, and feces that belied the fragility of our human bodies.

I was in a hospital with serious injuries. How did that happen when I was supposed to be at my Aunt Mave’s house to drop off some fireworks for the holiday? Only, I couldn’t remember dropping off the fireworks off. My mind slowly concluded I must have been in a car accident.

Suddenly, a muffled sound broke through my damaged ears, a steady but muted whine. Deep in my mental reconstruction, I was brought back to reality. This sound wasn’t a sound of alarm. This sound wasn’t a sound of warning. My mind struggled to complete its thoughts but suddenly an icy vise-like grip clamped upon me at the sudden realization. This sound was a sound of finality.

I wasn’t alone.

Or I hadn’t been at least. I guess now I was alone.

In burst a rolling cart, batting aside the flimsy wooden door like a medieval ram. Flanking the cart was a squad of nurses that bustled around in a flurry of action. Straining and failing to turn my head to peer over, I could only stare at the blinding white ceiling as my handicapped ears strained to listen to the ordeal. The dull thud of chest compressions tickled my muffled ears before an ear-splitting whine charged.

Thud. Thud. Screech. Thud. Thud. Screech. The pattern went on for several minutes amidst a low babble that must have been the nurses shouting at each other before it suddenly went quiet. Deathly silent.

The silence stretched out for several minutes. Fearing I might have lost my hearing completely, I struggled to shift my position enough to see across the room, but my weakened body was betraying me. I couldn’t escape the wire contraption that held my cast body still.

Suddenly, among the angry aches that throbbed from my efforts, a blazing hot sensation burned into my hand. I let out a scream, or whatever sound my mangled throat could produce, in shock at the flaring pain when suddenly a flying punch of stimulation hit my sensory nerves. It took a moment to realize I could hear again. The next thing I realized was swath of aches that covered my body was gone along with the mental fog that clouded my mind since I had woken.

Curiously, I tested moving my fingers and then my neck. Looking across the room I realized I hadn’t been able to hear the nurses leaving.

Eager with the newfound strength and clarity my body possessed, I quickly broke free of the wires and eased off the bed, still looking like the Michelin man. Scratching at my left-hand to break the cast open, I looked to see what had caused the flare of pain that precluded the strange reinvigoration of my mummified body. Astounded, I looked down at the birthmark I had since birth, a curious rectangular shape my mother had once called a miracle, a sign I was blessed.

It looked different. I could have sworn the left side wall of the bar looked fuller than I remembered. Relieved I was whole, but still confusedly shaking my head as I took in my surroundings more fully, this time with a clear mind and full senses.

Upon seeing the white cot several meters to my right, I immediately recalled the events that had just transpired.

Apprehensively, I approached the only other bed in the room. What I saw there froze me in shock. Dread coiled in my gut until I collapsed, dry retching onto the stark white floor, grasping at the bedrail to keep me supported.

The patient was missing the entire bottom portion of his body. His mangled torso looked like it had been caved in at several points. The jaw was angled off from the rest of the man’s face.

It wasn’t the gore that devastated me. It was the terrible inescapable truth. The mangled corpse that somehow managed to survive until a couple minutes ago, was a car crashed victim.

“I killed him.” I whispered with a sick understanding. I was a killer.

Flashes of it came back to me. The drumming rhythm of rain, screeching breaks and a light.

An eerie crimson red light haunted my memories, refusing to let go.

Unable to bear reality, I let out a strangled cry before breaking down into tears, weeping. Warm wet tears trickled down my arms as I cradled my head and rocked. Without warning, a flash of light passed through my vision.

Abruptly I sat up. What just happened? My eyes were closed and covered by my ha-

“Target Eliminated. Congratulations, You have now earned enough experience to reach level 2. You have completed *Phase I* of *Project Tratsiya*.” a female voice interrupted my inner monologue, reverberating through my skull. I couldn’t place where the sound was coming from.

“What the fu-“

“Your health level has been replenished. Please access your H.U.D. menu to spend your additional attribute points. The Committee for State Security hereby authorizes the activation of Sleeper Agent 327’s capacity for lethal diplomacy. *Dlya Matushka Rossiya*!”

Internally, I screamed in horror as lights began to flicker in view and scrolls of foreign text entered my field of vision.

But my face only contorted into a sickening grin as I proclaimed,

 “смерть американским свиньям!”
