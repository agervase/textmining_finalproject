Deeply Rattled, Jeremy reasoned quickly that the voice must have came form some sort of alarm system; or perhaps even worse: someone was home. Spinning around quickly, Jeremy reached for the open window.

<Smack>
<Crack>
"Ooouuuufffuuuck!!" 
The window had slammed shut onto his right hand. Luckily, He was able to pull his hand free before the window made a muffled thump within the frame.

Cringing in throbbing pain, Jeremy began to survey the room for another quick exit. 
"This place is a dump." Jeremy said to himself.
"There's nothing even here worth taking. I need to get out of here before the cops come."

Running towards a hallway in hope for the front door, Jeremy let out another loud scream - this time much more agony followed as pain shot up from his left leg.

"AHHHHHHHHAHAHHHHH" He cried. Blood shot up and painted his cheek and nose. Jeremy looked down to see the source of his agony, only to find a bloodstained two foot spike protruding from his left kneecap.

His face began to distort in at the sight of his mangled leg. This was all too much. His head began to become filled with thoughts orbited around fear and regret. 

[this wasn't supposed to be this way]
[this is way too much blood]

Just as Jeremy began to consider pulling himself together a loud deafening shot rang out through the darkened house.

<BANG>

Jeremy tasted blood. He felt a fire in his chest. Reaching down to feel his body he found nothing but blood and mush. Another shot rang out this one striking a piece of the spike that was still lodged in his leg. 

<BANG> <TING>

As the ground began to come closer to Jeremy's face. A loud grand voice filled the room with the words:

"Players 3 and 4 have entered the game!"
"Player 2 has been eliminated."
