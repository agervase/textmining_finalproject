I was a god among men.  Benevolent. Just.  They flocked to me, traveling land and sea, seeking my touch.  There were skeptics, of course. Disbelievers.  Yet even they could not contest what they saw before them, as flesh knitted together, as clouded eyes cleared, as the once feeble leapt to their feet and danced.

A temple was built, a place of worship and reception, where supplicants could come before me.  Beside me sat the boy, my son: the harbinger of this great era.  Aged, now, but still full of vitality, for he most of all deserved my gift.  Everyone knew the story of the v-shaped cut, the result of tumbling from a backyard tree so many years ago, and how it foretold this great gift.

When the distinctive cut appeared, just above my left knee, I could not comprehend it.  I sent everyone from the temple, pointing towards the door with an arm that was slowly bruising.  Just as slowly, the horror spread through my body.  I wasn’t blessed- I was cursed.  As I had unburdened the people, I had so burdened myself. 

A horrible fate, to suffer a thousand ailments, to die so that they need not.  It seemed an echo of older, weaker religions.  Or so I had imagined them to be.

I called for the boy, and he came, white haired but straight backed, striding forward with confidence. The lord giveth, and the lord taketh away, I murmured, kneeling before my son.  He did not question me, utter trust in his eyes.  

I pressed my thumb into his leg, hard, just above the knee.  He gasped.  Blood began to well up in a distinctive V, just as the mark on my own leg faded away.  I understood now.  I was not these people’s god.  I was their devil.
