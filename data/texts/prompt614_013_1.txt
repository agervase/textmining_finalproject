“I’ve survived for many years before the conception of humanity even became a reality, but like all things I forgot. Until one day I woke up and that’s when everything changed, I realized I was around to witness key events in all my lives to my present looking back i noticed the undying nerve that most mortals had which was that they were better than one another, it sickened me so I did what anyone would do in my position used my centuries of experience to change there minds. So I began a large scale plan to create an idea which can over power governments, principles, morals, and life it self into question with one sentence... are we conscious of the life we’re living or are we settling for the reality we’ve created in the safe box that is society are you you? Or what everything else wants you to be? 
I might’ve said one sentence but I got carried away now with this simple questions put in place more questions will be asked and then maybe there’d be another awakening the second conscious ascension which will separate the matraerlism which engulfs everyone to thinking it has inherent value when I actuality it doesn’t we give it the value we believe it deserves, most 20th century minds would be in awe with such questions and will blow it off but then the few that will rise to the question would put everything into carful analysis later sharing there thoughts with the abstract yet conheirnt reality which is the modern age of privilege and over saturation of pleasures, eventually destroying the rat race mind set creating a whole new vision for all and perspective, now that plans been laid out the story begins..
It was a sunny day people everywhere in this joyful day like any other. However I had a carefully placed plan laid out with my usb and 50 years of planing I was ready to download the program of the century which was capable of going worldwide in seconds and all I needed to do is sneak into YouTube, why YouTube you ask, because I wanted to know what really happened to YouTube that got blacklisted so my side quest took me a detour but I digress, now entering the building I’m approached by many characters which make me sick with there who are you questions I quickly knockem out because I trained with Bruce lee to taught me the art of I’m water and water is me and with that I was able to achieve one punch form, single handly defeating all the guards making it to the mainframe where I injected the question of life time, within seconds all websites programs signals etc were infected and turned and erased converting into my carefully calculated plan, but then I realized it was my other usb and that I had just downloaded my recipe for immortality sauce. I fucked up
many years later everyones immortal and work towards humanity’s survival Except me realizing what I’ve created i needed to fix it so it was back to the drawing board, however unlike before I was now richer then any other man for my recipe but still hated for destroying the internet, which I think was a blessing in disguise I flew my stealth bomber toward cern now controlled by the Scientologist and other fanatics I ejected into the sky carefully parachuting my way down into the facility where i fought my way through endless waves of wide eyed freaks and the top guy Tom with engaged in combat exchanging blow after blow he was the only equal to me for he had MI6 training and had mastered the Norris round house kick we fought for hours and probably would’ve kept going until I stopped and challenged him to a foot race fastest one would win loser surrenders, I knew I was going to lose for he’s had many running scenes, while my endurance was shot so took of first one to shivas statue he past me quickly laughing maniacally, however I’d have the last laugh I locked the door behind him and rushed to start the particle accelerator pushing it into over drive within seconds a black hole was created and we were all sucked in. Unfortunately our spirits live trapped together all fused into a single being I’m a cell now lol wtf
