It was beautiful and surreal at the same time. As the space station traveled around the planet I saw out my window the enormous gas giant. Behind it, coming just over the curve of the planet was the faint light of the far away sun. The side of the planet the station was on lurched forward and started changing. The lines of clouds rotating with the winds became longer and gray. Wisps of hair-like filaments extended toward the station. A faint, darker outline of what I could only describe as fangs slashed their way through the violent permanent storm and an enormous black triangular spot consolidated and rose out of the clouds.

"Captain," one of the researchers said, "We're detecting a strange signal coming from within the planet. I'll put it up on screen."

We came here because the observatories from earth have noticed some strane features on the planet's surface recently. These changes were to be studied. Some of the scientists who first saw the anomalies theorized that they were optical illusions within the clouds much like the face on Mars. It wasn't until recently that these changes happen every time one of the many moons orbiting the planet went full. Much like the tides on Earth, this phenomenon seemed to cross the planet in bands wherever the full moons were directly over the surface. In an instant an oscilloscope appeared on the bottom of the enormous computer screen monitoring the gas giant. The green line twitched and moved violently in waves with the passing of the full moons.

"I'll try lowering the frequency a little."

The researcher turned the dial on his part of the console lowering the oscilloscope just enough to be audible. What I heard coming from the computer would haunt me for the rest of the mission. It seemed as if the planet was howling.
