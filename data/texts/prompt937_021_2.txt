:"I told him his wish would have consequences."
Lawyer:"objection!"
Judge:"Declined!"
Genie:"Where was I...yes, I can remember vividly the day Mr.Kaya rubbed my lamp and wished to be as hard as a rock. Something like Luke Cage, he said. 
I don't even know what a Luke Cage is. I mean do you guys really think we have Netflix in our lamps? Are you mad !?
Judge:"Mr.Genie please get to the point."
Genie:"I will, just a moment. So all I understood was, making him rock solid. So I granted him his wish and transformed him into a rock."
Lawyer:"Your highness, my client explicitly said:"hard like a rock" not "I want to be a rock". 
There is clearly a big difference between the wish and what was granted."
Judge:"Is it possible to hear what Mr.Kaya has to say about it?"
Mr.Kaya:"......."
Judge:"I thought so. Alright, I think there mustn't be any further discussion. Mr.Genie could you please transform him back into a human being?"
Genie:"I could, but that would mean that he will have only one wish left."
Lawyer:"objection! This was not the fault of my client!"
Genie:"Well I don't make the rules. A wish is a wish. I can transform him back but I can't just use my magic 4 times without going back to my lamp. Are you actually insane?"
Judge:"Let's wrap this up. Mr.Genie transform Mr.Kaya back please we do not have the time for futher discussions, there is a brutal Fairy Unicorn murder case waiting for us."
Genie:"As you wish."

Mr.Kaya:" where am I? Everything was just...dark. I mean is this life?......
How can it be that the greatest torcher in life, could be existence itself!?!? I can't bear existence anymore!!! Please make it all stop!!!"
Judge:"*exhales deeply* it is always the same...
Security take him out of the courtyard."
Mr.Kaya:"Just make me sleep again *cries franatcly*."
