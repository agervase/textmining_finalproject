"But... you're the Devil. *Everyone* wants to read about you! Readers love you because you're so mythical and powerful -- you're the **embodiment** of evil. Plus, you're pretty cool. Some people even think you're *kind of hot*," said the writer, tugging at his shirt collar. The Devil let out an exasperated sigh but subconsciously moved his hand down toward his rippling red abdominals. 

"Writers," the writer continued, "Can use you as a clever metaphor or uh... or as an *allegorical device*. Then maybe -- probably -- they'll try to subvert the meaning of your presence," said the writer. "It's so *easy* to tack on a last sentence twist, when writing about a fallen angel."

"But surely it's **boring**," said the Devil, rolling his eyes and snorting flames. "Every damned prompt. Me. Everything that can be done with me, has been done.Try something original, something based on reality maybe. A prompt with a little *soul*."

They'd already been arguing for hours, and had made little progress. The Devil, and the writer.

"People don't want reality. They want escapism. They want to imagine forces of Good and Evil duelling over control of existence."

"Then have God, or Jesus, in the prompt. I'm fed up of having my name cheapened."

"God? Hm, that wouldn't really work. This is Reddit - we have a lot of Atheist-Lite's around here. To them, God is a pretty disliked figure."

The Devil's mouth dropped open. "How disliked , exactly?" 

"Oh, *pretty* disliked," said the writer, with a little laugh.

The Devil's strawberry face grew pale. "More than me?" he asked, in no more than a whisper.

"Sure."

"Oh."

"Hey, don't feel bad, big guy. They like to blame *everything* on God. Well, everything **bad**. And to them, there's a whole lot of bad in the world."

"But... that's thanks to *me*."

"They don't think so."

"So they blame God."

"Look, it's nothing personal. It's just cool to blame God. It makes religion look stupid. It's edgy stuff. It makes them feel superior - don't worry about it. You don't want to develop a complex. This isn't even about God - it's about *you!* Let's forget about it, we're going off on a tangent."

"No, it's too late to forget about it. I'm going to teach them all a lesson they'll never forget."

"Oh?"

"I'm going to retire. No more bad. No more death. Soon, they'll have nothing to blame God for. Who will they throw their misplaced misery and project their self loathing at then? They will only have themselves!"

"Oh boy..."
