"You're a lucky girl, we both know that, but it is about time you give in to me now. Even Death has a need for you people" the hollow voice unnaturally boomed across the hall. Death played with the coin in its bony fingers.

Sheila just smiled for what felt like an eternity. "I am getting tired too you know, I have seen somethings I wish I hadn't."

"Even better, just skip this formality and call it quits."

The smile didn't leave her lips, but her eyes looked tired. "Death, you know its not just coincidence that I keep winning. There's got to be some greater purpose of me having to go back up there!"

The coin stopped between the middle and ring metatarsal. "You've been up there for well over 200 years and yet you keep coming down here. Clearly you aren't doing any good are you?"

"Its the circumstances. I, I was helpless this time." The smile abruptly gone.

"Oh yeah. Helpless." He flipped through a book with his other hand. "You were homeless at the age of 17, became a prostitute and died of a heroin overdose at 22. What sort of a purpose are you serving?" 

"I dont know!" She stood up. She looked at the ground as if that might give her an answer. "I, I wanna go back as a 4 year old this time. Try and go to a different school, maybe that will change it." Her voice trailed away. 

"What do you want this time?" He asked, cool as ice.

"Does it matter" came the delayed answer. Her positivity sucked out. "My life has been hell anyway".

He  flipped the coin. Sheila saw a hint of glowing red in the darkness of the hood where the eyes should've been. Thats when she realised, that it in fact, didnt matter.
