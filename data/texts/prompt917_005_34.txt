**"And this just in, we have reports of an ongoing low speed chase in the suburban town of Stuartsville. Let's throw it live to Action 7 reporter Jill Haisley for more information. Jill?"**

"Thanks, Scott. First reports started trickling in about a chase in progress almost twenty minutes ago, and we now have the Action 7 helicopter overhead to follow any developments. There's no official word out of the Stuartsville Police Department, whose patrol cars are currently following the suspect's vehicle at about 23 miles per hour down Constitution Avenue. A number of our Action 7 Citizen Reporters have tweeted us about what they saw, a few of which read:

*Elderly couple in buick refusing to move from left lane, left blinker is on. @action7news*

*Crowds gathering to watch chase on sidewalk. Old man driving w/2 hands on wheel, grandma throwing #werthersoriginal out window @action7news*

*#CalgonIn60Seconds couple blasting Tony Bennett's Greatest Hits, telling police to "skedaddle."*

Like I said, Scott, still no official word from the local authorities, so we're unable to confirm any of the rumors that are flying around..."

"I made my pot roast, Charlie! You know how much they used to love my pot roast!" 

"I know, Edith, I know! You try to raise a kid right, and the second they buy a mask and an armor-plated suit, they don't have any time to come over and look at pictures from our trip to Key West!" Charlie Adams, 82, struggled with the  manual window crank on Buick LeSabre. 

Retired receptionist Edith Adams, winner of the 1954 Ms. Lux Soap Flakes pageant in Bromfield County, threw another handful of Werther's Original out the window. She had six more bags after her trip to the supermarket this morning, having found a 25% off coupon in Wednesday's paper.

The Masked Shadow, protector of the innocent, scourge of those who wish to do evil, and first trumpet for the 1982 Bromfield High School marching band, sighed as he turned off the TV. A life of anonymous crime fighting has its fill of regrets, he thought, but none larger than the time he promised his mother that he enjoyed her overcooked pot roasts.
