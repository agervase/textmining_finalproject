  God looked at his ipad again. He removed slowly his reading glasses. Opened glasses cleaning tissue and cleaned his glasses thoroughly. He put his glasses back on and started reading the text on the ipad again. The spell and the ritual were correctly performed. Not a single mistake was there to justify refusing the wish. He sighted and granted the man his wish. I will exchange his life for his wife’s life. The romantic fool. 

The first part was routine work. Taking the soul of the man. God filled in request form xv1227. Filled in the name of the deceased to be. His place of birth, date of birth and age. This was done to double check this crucial piece of information. In the middle ages when the process was less developed, millions of children died because of similar names. With the new system it was almost guaranteed that the person that supposed to die is going to die.

The process was even more critical in the kids cancer department. Giving cancer to kids was taken very seriously. God supervised this department personally and the request had to be signed by god himself, a demon and three senior angels. All kind of factors were taken into account. Kids background, his parents, his grades, his religion …etc. God preferred to give cancer to poor kids. Rich kids had lot of possibilities to defy his decision. They had health care. Health care was developing fast despite gods attempts to slow down the progress. His favorite soldiers in his battle against health care were anti-vaccers.

The second step to grant the man’s wish was more difficult. Bringing the wife back to life was not routine work. It was done before once. More than 2000 years ago. With god’s own son. He had to do a lot of shady stuff back then to pull that one off. God scratched his balls, sighted deeply and murmured “It will be an all nighter.”
