The dark and heavy clouds raged in the distance with the setting sun.  She slowly rocked in her rocking chair, the one her eldest son had made for her many birthdays ago, listening to the sounds of her hearth and the approaching storm.  Her left leg ached as it always did before a big storm, the same leg she had broken nearly 70 years ago, an inconvenient reminder of the life she had almost lost.

&nbsp;

In her lap lay her father’s bible.  She found humor in her faith, in how before the bombs fell she was a devout atheist to the point of forcefully trying to disprove all theology.  But now she knew, knew that it didn’t matter if you were an atheist or a theist, because it was irreconcilable differences like these that brought on the Third Great War.  She opened the book to the words of Isaiah, one page in particular marked with a long black feather.  The tips of her fingers stroked the silken vane.

&nbsp;

A sudden jolt of light poured in through the westward window, casting long shadows throughout the cabin.  When the light faded so too did the shadows, all but one.  A dark silhouette stood by her front door.  Fear tried to grasp her, but her old age had prepared her for this moment.  She didn’t say anything, not at first, waiting for the figure to pass in hopes that it was her imagination.  Thunder softly vibrated the walls.  A few minutes went by, but the figure remained, a sentinel amongst the darkness.  Another flash of light filled the room, this time her attention completely focused.  It was only for a second but it was more than enough time to recognize the familiar face.  Again, thunder vibrated the walls, more violently this time as the storm drew nearer.

&nbsp;

“I didn’t think we’d ever meet again,” she whispered the lie, half expecting him to not hear her.  He stepped closer, away from the threshold and into the soft glow of light cast by the fireplace.  There he stood, the same man that had saved her life 72 years ago.  Although, unlike her the passing of time had been much kinder to him.  He was exactly as she remembered, a handsome man in his 30s, clean shaven and dark ruffled hair, but it was his eyes she remembered most.  Eyes that could pierce stone; eyes that knew the secrets of the world, eyes that had seen it all.  How those eyes had comforted and also haunted her.

&nbsp;

“I was seventeen when you first appeared, my leg broken.  You saved me then, and guided me here, where I would meet my husband,” she said, more to herself than to him.  “Tell me, do you remember me?”

&nbsp;

“I remember,” he said, the words soft and beautiful, but they also carried something more tenacious.

&nbsp;

“I’ve told that story many times, saying you were my guardian angel.  And when Andrew, my oldest, was bitten by that snake, he said a strange man had cared for the injury and carried him to the edge of the field, where we found him.”  She paused, looking into those old eyes.  “I knew it was you who had saved him, as you had saved me.  I told them all not to fear the shadow, for he was there to protect us.”  She paused, afraid to speak what was next, but she steadied herself and continue on.  “I’ve had a very long time to think, as it seems that is all old ladies are good for,” she smiled at her own humor, but it quickly faded.  “However, you only seem to appear when death is ready to make a claim.”  Again she paused, unsure of how to ask her question.  She licked her dry wrinkled lips.  “Tell me please, do I know your name?”

&nbsp;

“Yes.”

&nbsp;

“Then please, say it for me.”

&nbsp;

The storm once again sent out a great ray of light, filling the room.  In that brief moment she thought she saw two giant black feathered wings folded behind the man’s back.

&nbsp;

“Azrael,” the name rolled perfectly off his tongue.

&nbsp;

A deafening explosion sounded not far off from the house, startling her as she slightly jumped in her seat.  Everything within shook from the force and rattled briefly as the light cast from outside flickered back into darkness, once again leaving the room filled with only silence and the soft glow of the fireplace.

&nbsp;

“I see,” she rubbed her left leg in a futile attempt to massage the pain away.  “Then perhaps it was not only you who saved me, but also I who saved you?”  The question lingered in the air, unanswered by the man.  “For what is a farmer if he has no crops to reap.”  The man knelt in front of her and extended his hand out to her, palm up.  She placed her own small and fragile hand onto his.  He grasped it, strong but gentle.

&nbsp;

"Tell me what I must do,” she asked, tears beginning to roll down her cheeks.

&nbsp;

With his other hand he grasped her shoulder, the touch warm and oddly comforting.

&nbsp;

“Just breathe.”

&nbsp;

She took in a slow and shaky deep breathe, and then let it all out, her very last.  Her hand went limp in his, and her posture slumped heavily into the chair.

&nbsp;

The sky suddenly broke open and unleashed the torrent it had been holding back.  The rain beat down on the tin roof, deafening any further sounds.  From within his long dark garbs, he pulled a small book and flipped to a page near its beginning.  There he found her name amongst her many descendants.  The tips of his fingers stroked the name upon the page.  And in so doing her name was struck from it, leaving a now empty gap amongst the many names upon the page.  However, even in its absence he knew he would never forget it.  *Aliza Klein*, his small joy that brought hope back into his world.

&nbsp;

He put the book back into his inner pocket and in so doing saw on the floor another book.  This one slightly larger than his own, and near the middle of its pages stuck a long black feather.  He picked it up and flipped the book open, smiling at the familiar item held within.  And upon the page was a highlighted verse.

&nbsp;

*Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you.  I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.*

&nbsp;

*formatting and stuff
