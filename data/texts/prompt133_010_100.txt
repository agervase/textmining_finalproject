"This Death guy is sending you messages on Twitter"

"Oh what does he want this time?"

"Sorry Johnny, he's a grown up friend, and a stranger to you"

*Received 11:42*

>You can come too, Johnny.

"Grandpa, he knows my name, and said I can come!"

"No Johnny"

"Grandpa he said I could again"

"Dammit Johnny, give me my tablet, you're not playing games."

*Received 11:44*

>And bring me money my dry cleaning fee.

"And he also said to bring money for dry cleaning"

**Johnny walked over and gave his grandfather the tablet, and frowned.** 

"So why can't I meet him, he sounds like a nice pe-"

"Because I said so"

"Aww"

"Go To your Room"

**Johnny left the room and went to his room.**

>Are you paying attention still?

*Sent 11:54*

>No, leave me alone.

**Andy waited passed out with the tablet in his lap, till there was a knock at the door, and the grandfather clock dinged. Andy got out of the chair and opened the door to see death there in his robes and scythe**. 

"Hi Andy, how was your 267th birthday this year on earth?"

"Cut to the chase death, you just want your damn money"

"Yep, and let me guess, you still won't pay it."

"Nope"

"Someday once I get rights, I'm going to take you to court for it."

"The same day you decide to do your job."

"Hey it's not my fault, you decided to have muddy boots and not watch where you were walking when I was taking your wife to heaven."

"And its not my fault you wear all black, maybe you should of worn a green robe."

"Hmph."

"See you again next year, Deathy-darling!"

**Andy shut the door on death, and death yells from the outside.**

"Oh Come-on Andy, you only owe me about Tree-Fiddy!"
