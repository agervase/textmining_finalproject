"So you honestly had no idea at all?" Ramsey asked me, surprised. I have never followed news about celebrities and I've never asked my girlfriend "Are you THAT Ramsey?" I thought it would be silly. Probably have heard that a dozen of times, so I said nothing.

"No, I really had no idea." Awkward silence fell between us. He stood in the doorway of the kitchen for a while, looking at me.

"So..." I broke the silence and turned to the table. "What you think of the steak?" I asked.

"It was bought frozen, right?" he looked into my eyes.

"Yes."

"It is thawed. The steak is thawed." I'm not a man that can be intimidated easily, but something about this whole thing gave me the creeps. A strange man he is.

"I mean, not everyone can be a good cook." I stuttered.

"Oh no, that isn't a problem. Listen, not everyone can be a good cook and it would be absolutely moronic to expect anything different. I did not come here to eat great cuisine and you know that. I came here because this is my kitchen. But that, right now, is neither here nor there. Each has their own strengths and yours is not cooking."

I finally felt relieved. Turned out that his anger and rage is all for show. But, still, for some reason he did not look entirely happy.

"Well, that is right." I agreed. "But you still are frowning. I mean, I'm a great..." and there he interrupted me.

"A great scum is what you are! God damn, man! Matilda is just 16 years old! And how old are you? Like, thirty? What the fuck? What is your problem you absolute wanker? And I catch you in my kitchen at three am cooking steaks? Scraping my pans with a metal spatula? Using my spices? I give you three seconds to get out or there will be idiot-casserole for breakfast!"
