The police were as bewildered as Mick and I pretended to be, as I showed them my very alive husband, making dinner in the kitchen.

"We have a body at the morgue," one of the officers said to him. "The identification and photos said it was you. So did your mother."

"Oh," I answered, as if that explained things. "Mick's dad is from a big family, and his cousins all look similar. His mom never has gotten used to it and calls all the boys Mick. His dad might make a better ID, but that side of the family doesn't talk to me and changes their names and numbers a lot. Come to think of it, that might be why Nancy calls them all Mick—he's the only one who's kept the same name, since his dad divorced her."

The conversation didn't go much longer before the police left. Just in time, too, because they barely made it out the door and into their car before Mick burst out laughing his ass off.

I scowled. "It was strange enough to be true—more believable than telling them you were playing games with constructed bodies *again*. Are you trying to get the Multiplanetary Commission to kick you off *another* planet?"

Mick smiled, beauty and peace radiating from the core otherwise hidden by the body he wore, and I let my own glow with discontentment and annoyance. "I happen to like Earth."

"I don't," he answered simply.

I sighed and resigned myself to another round of weird corpses as Mick did everything short of actual breaking actual rules (no, just unwritten ones, considered common sense) until he was fired from this research position and we had to adapt to *another* planet.

At least my story meant the corpses would be assumed to be some kind of targeted killing in his family, which would culminate in ours being left behind. Much safer for the Earthlings that way. I'd just have to enjoy Earth while I had access to it.
