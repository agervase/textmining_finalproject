Un'beta-ed and written between helping patrons at work: 

**PART ONE**

I sighed as they placed the cuffs around my hands, holding their guns at me, fear in their eyes. They knew I could kill them all. Hell, normally I would, but for *her*...I'd hold off for today. I hadn't even planned on doing a heist on this gorgeous day but the bank had said I missed the mortgage on my cafe and...well...I needed the money. 

Hopefully I could break out quickly this time. Accel-a-heal, as the masses stupidly called *her*, always went to *The Daily Grind* after a fight with **The Reaper**...me. It was ironic that Accel-a-heal, or just Accel, or Becca’s (as it is her real name and not some stupid hero name) favorite coffee spot was also owned by her worst enemy, me...The Reaper...Gabrielle Vasquez. 

It hopefully wouldn’t take too long for the Villains Coalition to break me out of my holding cell, hours even, but I couldn’t just rely on them. Concrete-Crasher could just barrel in through the walls with his powers or DynoMighty could just blow a hole in the wall with her powers. Me? I could only kill. Which...is pretty useless when it comes to breaking out. 

My eyes met Accel’s...though mine were hidden behind a stupid skull mask because why not embrace the idiotic name they gave me...the Reaper. I could see that her wounds were healing quickly...good. I’d hate for her to actually be hurt. I purposely missed her Origin but I know one of my knife wounds got dangerously close. It was my way of trying to end the fight quickly. You destroy someone’s Origin, you destroy their powers. I could scare her into fighting wilder and more aggressively. It was fun, actually. Normally she was so reserved and cautious...but throw real danger at her and Becca was a secret spitfire. 

My weird way of flirting, I guess. That, and the actual flirting I did with her when she came into my shop. It was fun, try to kill her and then serve her coffee. She didn’t try and hide her identity so she’d come in and I’d have to congratulate her on defeating me or my allies. It’s how I fell in love with her, actually. Just having normal conversations. That, and she was the perfect nemesis. Accel-a-heal, like her name implied, had the power of accelerated healing...but not quite. I had killed several heroes with accelerated healing, Dr. Nurse, Healix, and Med-bae to name a few. Just have to do enough damage to their body, destroy their brain, or their Origin (which was usually hidden in their brain or heart). Her powers worked a little differently, instead of just healing a cut or wound (which she could do), her major organs just recreated themselves elsewhere in her body. So stabbing her in the head, she’d just regrow her brain in her stomach before it migrated back up. Same with her heart. And her Origin. I had never met someone whose Origin moved. So every time we fought, it was like a new puzzle every time. I guess in theory I could have killed her back in the day but that would have taken too much effort and it would be no fun if I no longer had her around to guess where her Origin moved.

“Move it, Reaper.” An officer growled, his gun pointed towards me. We were already at the holding cells. Hmm. Guess I got lost in thought again. I quietly walked the halls, going towards my designated cell. The walls were imbued with some sort of technology that was supposed neutralize Origins but I could still feel my power there, lurking under the surface, ready to be used if I wanted. I listened to some cop’s spiel how I was going to stay there for a long time and how I was the most wanted woman in the city, etc. It was boring and something I had heard many times before. 

“Turn on the tv.” I demanded as I laid on my cot. One cop quickly turned it to the cooking channel, he knew my favorite channel. His buddy, the one who had given the speech, rolled his eyes and changed it to the news before taking the remote with him. I glared at him behind my mask. No one was brave enough to confiscate anything from me, except my knives. He was really trying my patience. 

I zoned out watching the news, though, I did perk up when Accel popped on screen. She gave a short speech and then reporters were all over her for questions. She picked a journalist and someone asked, 

“What do you think the Reaper’s powers are?” She hesitated and gave the usual “I have no idea” answer. 

“Killing.” I answered, though, no one could hear me. That was my power. Killing. Accel explained on screen how there was no record of me ever going to any of the hero schools so she, like everyone else, had no idea what my power was. Of course there was no record of me. I never went to hero school. How does a child with the power to kill even exhibit their powers in the first place? They don’t. I grew up thinking I was ordinary. Hell, it wasn’t until an armed robber tried to take the money from my register did I figure out I had any sort of power. 

From there I tried it on various villains. Each one giving me the opportunity to learn more about how my power worked. All I had to do was fight someone long enough and I could find out to kill them...and then do it. Later I moved onto some heroes too, the not-so-good ones. Like the Fireman. He liked to talk big about how he was antibullying when he put a kid in a coma simply cause he looked at him “wrong” in the locker room. He was a true test of my skills. While most people’s Origins were located in their bodies, mouth, heart, stomach, etc, his was intangible. His ever-burning-fire *was* his Origin. After that, I became one of the most feared villains in Republic City. Arctica, Dr. Nurse, Symphonica, all heroes and hypocrites who fell before me. 

And then Accel came. And she was truly a good person. She wanted to change our world. She wanted people to change for the better. And she tried her damnedest, even when her only power was healing her own body. 

I could hear shouting in the halls and explosions elsewhere in the facility. DynoMighty, then. She was kind, for a villain. 

I looked at the tv and frowned behind my mask. Breaking news about a massacre at some local company. Maybe a disgruntled employee who had just discovered his or her powers and is taking it out on those who wronged them? The name “KniveHands” popped up and I had no idea what was worse. Someone calling themselves that, or the local populace naming someone that. Either way, they were responsible. 

Camera footage flickered from the scene of the company to a street not far as three heroes faced off against some villain I had never seen before. I assumed he was KniveHands...if only because the poor bastard at literal knives sticking out of his hands, like a bad Edward Scissorhands cosplay. Soundwave, Scream-o-rama, and Museic seemed like they were doing fairly well against KniveHands, they were all heroes I had faced off against and I knew they could be a hand-full. But then KniveHands stabbed Soundwave in the hands before tossing him to the side to stab Scream-o-rama in the mouth, and then with incredible speed, he ran and stabbed Museic in her right ear. The Musical Trio lay injured, dead, and dying. This...this was not good. I had faced off against the three before and knew exactly where their Origins were...they were in the exact places KniveHands had stabbed. If the knife hands were a secondary power...and his real power was the ability to see Origins...he was a very, very powerful villain. 

The camera switched from the scene in the street and back to Accel’s press conference and my heart leapt to my throat. She was gone and the words on screen said “Accel-a-heal Swears to Stop KniveHands”. If he can see Origins...then he could find hers. Even when it moved. I had to get out of here. I had to save her. 

An explosion opened a large hole in the wall of my cell and I rushed to give DynoMighty a hug. She tentatively returned it. 

“I have to save Accel.” I stated, my eyes darting back to the tv. I hope I wasn’t too late. DynoMighty looked confused but nodded as she handed me my weapons. 

“Tearo is outside, you could ask him for a ride.” DynoMighty said. I shouted a “thanks” as I ran down the hall. The half-man, half-pterodactyl was outside, as DynoMighty had promised. I quickly explained the situation and he picked me up and began flying towards the area we thought KniveHands and Accel might have ended up. 

It didn’t take too long, we followed the screams and shouts of fear. Accel was already bleeding heavily but was healing, slower than she usually did. Did he get close to her Origin? Or was many of her major organs injured because of our fight today? Tearo dropped me off and then flew off and away. There was no way he was getting involved in this and I don’t blame him. 

KniveHands roared like an idiot and charged at Accel. I couldn’t let him hurt her. I ran forward too, as fast as I could. Pain blossomed in my side and I knew I had reached her in time. I heard Accel gasp and I couldn’t help but laugh. Her surprised face was hilarious. I met KniveHands’s savage look with the angry one my skull mask gave. He growled like an animal and jumped back as far away from me as possible. My wound was bad but survivable.
