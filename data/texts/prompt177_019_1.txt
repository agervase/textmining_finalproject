My son is dead, and I'm chasing him. He is 6. He was six. I guess he will always be six. 

It's cold outside. There are dead leaves everywhere, crunching like rodent bones under my boots. The tag of my shirt tickles my neck. It's on backwards, maybe, but I don't stop running. I'm looking at the hoods of the cars in the parking lot. I'm looking for my son, who is dead. 

I look for scratches, and when I don't find them I make them. My nails break, i think, and my teeth grind, but the car hood is unscathed.

 Someone left a rake leaning against the peeling cedar planks of the building. I take it and twirl it over my head like a spear, then down. It rattles my the bones in my hand on impact, and it dents the hood. 
 I'm surprised I still have bones in my hand. But even the dead still have bones. 

Another car behind me gets the same treatment. Which one is the killer? The human got away, but these cars can pay. Someone sees me, they shout from above, but I move on to the next car, I crack the windshield this time. Spiderweb cracks spray out from the center, the safety glass holds. 

Someone takes my rake. I think I'm crying. I hear someone explain to someone else. Her son is dead. But they say it nicely. He passed away. 

Hit and run. Here in the parking lot. 

Oh shit, the say. They drop the rake and back away from me, as if they might catch a dead kid off of me. As if maybe the hitter and runner will be back to finish me off too. Don't stand too close. 

They say my name, and I stop chasing him. They walk me back to my apartment, but there's no little boy there, so it doesn't matter.
