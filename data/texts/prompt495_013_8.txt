I’ve known you for a long time. 

First as a neanderthal taking the first steps as man, then as a pauper born in a vast and crumbling city ruled by a circle of old men, as a doctor, as a merchant, and finally, a soldier.

Your soul is pure, which is why you’ve been renewed many times. The lives you lead were all meaningful and deep which matured your soul to a state where it no longer can grow. And so, you’ve been granted personification in my realm.

My name is irrelevant. I simply am and you are simply you. Time is of no importance for my role, but time is a ruler that even I, obey. 

You’ve stayed with me for far longer than you realize. And have known me far longer than you come to understand.

This all takes it’s toll, and souls, even mine, fall to the weight of the ones I take.

In my room there sits a wooden desk, a simple bed, and a single door. In the beginning I had none of these things for there was no need. But now my soul is weary and weak and needs to renew in the arms of Life. 

You will take my place. There is no need of me to ask because it’s something we both understand. 

All of this has happened for an eternity, for time is not important to us- it simply is. I have seen you die countless times as much as you’ve witnessed mine. 

How many times have we sat here in embrace only to part and fulfill the roles desired of us? As you can see, I am weary.

I yearn to breathe again in the warmth of light. This realm is for one being and one presence only. 

All of this is a necessity. All of this is for you. Let us fall in love again in the realm of man as merchant, doctor, and soldier.

Let us suffer, live, breathe, and fall into Life’s uncontrollable romance. 

Watch me as I have watched you.
