The darkness around the corner of the room darkened slightly before a blade seemed to appear from within and tear open reality. A cloaked figure glided out of the hole examining the room. There hanging from the fan was his goal, a corpse spinning slowly as the fan spun. The rest of the room was bare except a steel bad frame with a ragged mattress stripped of its sheets.    
The cloaked figure paused as this looked remarkably similar to a job done not a week ago.  After a moment of observation, it moved forward and using the blade of scythe carried to touch the body. As the body continued spinning away from the blade, a glowing orb of energy was pulled out of the body.   
Closer to the body the cloaked figure could tell that it looked identical to the one that had been dealt with only a week ago.  The orb flickered and glowed with a pale blue light. Then spoke as some did as the cloaked figure turned back towards the still open tear in reality. “So, it’s been a while.”  
The figure stopped moving and the shadowed opening turned to face the glowing orb attached to the scythe blade. Then in a gravelly voice responded, “not as long as most souls.”   
“Oh I know, but its nice seeing you again, well seeing but not, well you know what I mean.” The orb rushed out as the cloaked figure started moving again towards the tear. “Sooooo, what have you been up too?”  
“I have been guiding souls to the afterlife, as is my job.” The cloaked figure spoke as the tear in reality started to close behind the cloaked figure.  
“That’s cool, This life was shorter than the las…” the soul’s etherial voice being silenced as the tear sealed itself up.    
A short while later, the lights in the room came on and a group of people in white lab coats entered and examined the body, before carefully taking it down.
