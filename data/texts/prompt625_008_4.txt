A faint glow appeared on the monitor in the cockpit. It grew in intensity as the signal got stronger. An alarm began to sound in the ship. 

“Arthur!” Yelled Captain Donohue. 

Captain Donohue was a strong women, larger than most of the men on the crew, while still possessing a soft beauty about her. Much like a loving grandmother who could knock out the neighborhood bully with a single swing. Her eyes were a soft brown like nice autumn day. 

“Arthur, Get down here now the COMS alarm”, she shouted again.

Arthur scaled the latter’s of the spacecraft bouncing from wall to wall as he made his way to the cockpit. This specific craft was Contact 2, the second of its kind, designed spacecraft for making first contact with life outside our solar system. Contact 1 the sister ship had departed 5 years earlier and was on the same course we were until it disappeared. It will be the anniversary tomorrow.

Arthur busted into the cockpit. He spun around like he was unable to control himself in the weightless environment even after years of practice. 

“Get ahold of yourself” Donohue seemed to be fed up with Arthur’s antics. 

“Is it Contact 1? Did we find the lost sons of bitches?” Arthur said in a raspy worn voice. 

He began to turn knobs and punch different key combinations into the ships panel. Then the image stopped flickering and began to glow a steady green on the screen. A light so bright it Illuminated Arthur's worn and weathered face. 

“Holy Fuck” said Arthur, “Take a look what we have here Cap.”

Captain Donohue floated over to the consul and began to examine the glowing green image on the screen. The blood began to drain from her face as she drifted frozen.

“It can’t be” She muttered.
