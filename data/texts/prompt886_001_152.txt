â€‹Part 1

"did they pass?" The worried look said otherwise, "they failed?"

"Spectacularly."

"Damnit. Well, get the funeral march ready. Tonight we commemorate a species. How many died?"

"Over 100 million died as a result of the test."

"Bloody hell, im surprised there were that many to begin with."

"Over 7.5 billion still live."

".... 7... alive? What? How! If they failed how are any still alive? Surely this is a pass."

"No sir, but it was a rollercoaster. We engineered a war, WW1 they call it now. On 3 occasions the war nearly didn't happen. It was far larger than we anticipated so we tried to put a stop to it by convincing the tsar- the leader of one of their super powers- to hold back his troops. Unfortunately our actions only guaranteed his response.
They fought around the world for 4 years but made a peace treaty."

"What the hell is a peace treaty?"

"Well, it's where the leaders from both sides sit at a table together and agree to stop fighting. They choose a winner and make financial or territorial demands of the looser. It's a fascinating process that is unique to this species."

"So why didn't they pass the test? "

" they started fighting again. 10 years later the new leader of the losing side started a war of retaliation. The fighting lasted for 6 years and his country was crushed, then carved up."

"I see. That's why they failed."

"That's not all sir. Over the course of the wars they discovered nuclear weaponry."

"Weapons? Like bombs? They discovered them first. Not power generation. In a war. and they aren't all dead?"

"I am getting to that sir. Most of the old world powers exhausted themselves in the wars, they came to rely heavily on a new leader who has become their successor and a new super power.
After the end of the Second World War these two super powers started a Cold War-"

"Again, what's a Cold War?"

"Another thing unique to this planet. Both of the super powers have planetary nuclear weapons so when they found themselves at the edge of war they stopped-"

"Just like that? They stopped the war before it started? If it wasn't for the two previous wars then that would be a pass, no?"

"Not exactly sir. They didn't enter open warfare but they didn't back down. They discovered the concept of mutually assured destruction and for 50 years fought a series of small wars disguised as civil wars in which each side had support."

"Tell me this. What is the test meant to consist of?"

"We, um. We engineer a small but potentially devastating war between two powerful factions. If they avoid war they pass. If they do not then we engineer the combat to last only a brief time and leave the balance of power unaffected."

"And yet. You caused 3 major cultural events-

"There is a precedent sir! A well established one. Sometimes more warlike species do fall into a world wide conflict, in which case we step in and prevent it.
These humans showed none of the hallmarks of warlike, none of them. They have no natural defences or weapons, they build complex societies with rigid hierarchies. They have a concept of global currency and complex economic structures. They seemed even less warlike than us, sir. Also it was 4 major events."

the commander sighed heaviy, "Fine. What was the 4th one?"

"The second war combined with the Cold War seem to have caused great and lasting instability in the ancient centre of their culture. The result is that a series of nationless factions motivated by superstitions have repeatedly detonated bombs or caused other tragedies in other population centres. They call it terrorism, and it is one of the major factors shaping human societies today."

"Damnit!"

"It gets worse sir."

"How? How could it get worse?"

"Well, as a side effect of discovering nuclear weapons they have discovered space travel. They have already visited their own moon and are intentionally hurling boxes of electronics into space, both as a scientific endeavour and to try and contact us. In addition they are poisoning their own planet and are developing plans to abandon it and colonise the 4th planet."

"Dear gods. What have we done..."

"Accidentally given rudimentary space travel to the most adaptable, fastest developing and most destructive race in the galaxy, sir. But we can still fix this."

"How? Their planet is dying, they know this. But many of them still deny it. It would not be difficult for us to manipulate their governments to defund space exploration. Smother them in the crib."

"Do it, do it now."

"I Will handle it personally sir."

Part 1.5

Some time later

"Sir, I regret to inform you that I have failed. Wealthy individuals have replaced the funding taken away by governments. Furthermore our covert actions have drawn attention.

"How so?"

"An organisation called the conspiracy theorists. Their stated purpose is to find connections and uncover the truths hidden by governments or other organisations. They have grown suspicious of us and begun to draw the connections. If we keep going they will find us."

"Damnit!" he visibly controlled himself and sighed softly, "What do you recommend?"

"First contact. It's the only thing left. Maybe we can make allies of them?"
