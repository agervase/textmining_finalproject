*The sky is an expanse of grey -- liquid water falls in heavy drops from the heavens, striking streets of black and grey stone stained green by age and weather. Carriages of steel and iron blur past, scattering water droplets upon the commoners walking to-and-fro, huddled beneath hoods and canvas sheets.*

*The rain rolls down panes of invisible crystal that protect you from the elements. The three of you sit within the warmth of a coffee shop that serves hot drinks and sweet confections. Would you like to describe your characters?*

"I'll go first. I'm a six-foot tall human man with tanned skin and lots of muscle. I'm bare-chested with a pair of cargo shorts and flip-flops. My eyes are protected by sunshades--"

"Why are you wearing sunshades in the rain?"

"There are lights inside, aren't there? I get advantage on Perception check relying on sight while I'm in direct light."

*What's your character's name?*

"Chad."

*Okay, Chad, the bonus from Sunglasses only works in direct sunlight.*

"Is it still an action to put them on in combat?" 

*Yeah.*

"Chad will continue to wear the sunshades inside."

"Me next, I'm playing Sharon. She's a middle-aged woman with false-colored hair. She's also wearing sunglasses, but hers turn into regular glasses when not in sunlight."

"Wait, can I get those?"

*No, Chad, you don't have enough starting gold since you took the age 10-20 background.*

"Sharon has a large, leather purse that is packed full of all sorts of things. She's sipping on a... large frappuccino, so I get advantage on initiative for an hour."

"Chad's drinking one too."

*Both of you mark off 3 gold from your starting money.*

"Why is everything so expensive? Can I take out a soul loan to get more starting money?"

"This is the 21st, Chad, soul loans don't exist yet."

*Let's just get through introducing all the characters.*

"I'm playing L̸̨̘͕̝̮̗̝̰̪̙̙̰͓͚̼̲̏͂ͮ̂ͮ̇̃́̂͂̐̍͗͡͞ͅ'͗ͦ̄̒͗ͤͪ͐̓̈́̓҉̵̩̬̦̣̬͍̗̱͙̩̫͙̺̜̝͉̳͟͡ͅa̡̛̖̭̝̪͖̲̯ͧ̑̉̍̀̚͟x̸̶̶̢̺͕͚͚͂̌͐̒ͣͩͣ̽͘i̵̷̧̢͓͖̩̮͙͐͌ͦ͛ͫͩ͋̀̿̂ͯ̍̅--"

"That's not a 21st century name!"

"My character's a, uh, time traveler from the future, so he's got a modern name."

*Did you forget to read the rulebook again?*

"No! I read it, I just didn't like any of the names there. They all sound dopey."

*Fine. Tell us about your character.*

"He's a time traveler from modern times, but nobody believes him, so he has the homeless penalty."

*He wouldn't be allowed inside the cafe with that penalty.*

"Sharon is buying him a drink, so he can be inside with us."

*Okay, Sharon, mark off another 3 starting gold. Anything else? Good.*

*As you settle into the comfortable, synthetic cushions, sipping at your beverages, the door suddenly opens, a gust of wayward flowing air bringing droplets in--*

"I rolled a 15."

*Chad, you didn't need to roll anything.*

"But you said the water got inside. I rolled Dexterity to avoid taking acid damage."

*Water isn't acidic until the 22nd century setting.*

"Oh, sorry."

*It's okay...*

*-- water droplets blow inside, carried behind the light-blockage of a thin man in a tailored suit. He steps inside, his feet squeaking on the tile floor. He approaches your table and stares at you, a thin face regards each of you.*

*The man speaks, "I'm glad I finally found you. My name is Jeff Bezos, and I need your help."*
