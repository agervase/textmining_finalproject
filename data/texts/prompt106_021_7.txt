*"IT'S TIME THIS STOPPED."*

Hands covered in blood, she turned to it and smiled. There was nothing but a dark cloak, but she knew. Death itself stood there. It was unmoving and expressionless, stiller then stone. Her experience with it when she was five led her to seek it out. At first, she squashed bugs, a flash of his presence electrified her, but she needed more. So she turned to animals. Got a job at a pest control agency. Then, killing strays. A brief glimpse, but still it moved like lightning. 

Humans would be next. It would last for moments, it discussing in an irritatingly hushed tone with the dearly departed. Then gone, gone with the wind. Still, she lived, and killed for those moments. But this was different. Finally, it acknowledged her toll and tributes. IT WAS HERE FOR HER. Oh sure, start with a scolding tone, it would end with their eternal matrimony-

*"IT ASTOUNDS ME, THAT YOU ARE THIS BRAZENLY STUPID. TO THINK YOU COULD COURT ME. ESPECIALLY IN THIS MANNER. HONESTLY, THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING."* 

Her fantasy waned. 

*"I KINDLY ASK YOU STOP. MANY OF YOUR KIND HAVE PAID ME PATRONAGE IN THE PAST. WHEN IT'S CIGARS, BOOZE OR PRAYER, I SHRUG AND SAY 'YOU KNOW WHAT? SURE, MEET ME A FEW YEARS LATER WITH LOVING FAMILY AS OPPOSED TO AN ERRANT TRUCK. WHY NOT?'"* 

*"BUT THIS KIND OF NONSENSE IS JUST SILLY. I MEAN OKAY, WHOOPDEE-DOO, YOU DID WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY. CONGRATS, YOU HAVE THIS POWER AND USED IT TO TRY TO APPEASE ME OR TRY TO DO MY JOB, OR BRING ME FORWARD BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A BIG FAN."*

Her fantasy gasped for air. It was drowning.

*"DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE FOR YOU TO DO? BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. LIVE, BE HAPPY, MAKE OTHERS HAPPY. I AM AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE END OF ALL THINGS, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. YOU SEE ME, BUT THAT'S NOT THAT SPECIAL. YOU ARE ROUGHLY THE 4000TH PERSON TO BE ABLE TO. OR WAS IT 5000? DON'T REMEMBER, CAN'T SAY I EVER BOTHERED TO SERIOUSLY COUNT. I'M GUESS-TIMATING."*

*"POINT IS, YOU KNOW THAT OLD SAYING 'IT'S ABOUT THE JOURNEY, NOT THE DESTINATION'? THAT'S KIND OF THE THING. I LOVE ALL THE JOURNEYS YOU ALL TAKE. WATCHING EVERYTHING AT ONCE IS THE KIND OF POPCORN FODDER ALL OF YOU COULD ONLY EVER DREAM OF. I LAUGH, I CRY, I FEEL IT ALL. BUT I MOSTLY PREFER THE STORIES WHERE I AM INCIDENTAL TO IT ALL. WHERE I JUST TAKE A BACKSEAT AND LET YOU ALL DECIDE WHAT'S NEXT. I DON'T HATE MY ROLE IN ALL THIS, BUT I'M NOT THAT EXCITING. ENDINGS AREN'T THAT EXCITING TO ME, CAUSE I'M A PART OF EACH AND EVERYONE."*

Finally, she spoke, tears in her eyes. "But why are you here then? Is this not my end?" 

Death shrugged. *"SORRY TO DISAPPOINT, BUT THIS IS A NEW BEGINNING FOR YOU. A GENRE SHIFT. FOR THE BEST REALLY, THIS WHOLE STORY WAS BORING AND I AM ENDING IT. THIS IS THE END OF YOUR ATTEMPT AT A ROMANCE WITH ME. THIS IS THE END OF YOUR FANTASY."*
