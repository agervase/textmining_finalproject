I remember dying, though it’s weird and I would rather I didn’t.

It was a cold day, not too unexpected for late January - snow always on the horizon for central London. I’d left work, as usual, popped into a pub with a colleague, perhaps too usual an occasion then, for the Monday habit was starting to wear hard on both liver and wallet. I’d caught a train heading north, switched at Wembley Park, nipped off for a pee at Kingsbury and got to the end of the line without incident. I walked through the barriers, shaking my head as a young boy forced his way through without paying. Sprinted up the too many steps and out onto the street, through wafts and then clouds of marijuana smoke. A quick turn left took me to the bus stop. A cold seat soothed my sore legs though took its toll on my butt. I looked up at the roar of a car as it passed, smelled stale alcohol, softly, then stronger. Glanced up to my side then, to see him, his words not quite registering. “Wallet or die, cunt”. He repeated them, my hands flying up, his hand thrusting out. The glint of metal. The pain and the fear. The blood, so much blood. The cold, not just from the seat now. The pain, redoubled. The cold. Then like falling asleep, mixed with sharp terror and sadness.

And again I stood, remembering. As I had done a half dozen times. Waiting, though unsure what for. A light in-front was blinding, though I could not remember its source. A word, then two appeared.

I felt fear in waves, crashing against me like a weathered shore. Nostalgia too, mixed with deja vu. I reached out, pressed the words with soft fingertips.

The pain came again, but different, the time with pressure. I felt my body twist, contort, threaten to break. I burst forth, eyes unseeing, screaming for air. I smelled blood and waste, brought back to the moment of my death. Then I smelled iodine and plastic. The doctors and midwives milling around. I new that I was reborn. Though what the fresh incarnation would bring, I would have to wait to find out.
