What?

I logged onto reddit a few hours ago, as the addiction continued, but had exhausted /all through fifty pages. The site gets old when you sprint through it, unfortunately. So, I tried my luck at the ‘random’ button. Something to spice up my meme knowledge perhaps. Or I’ll stubble into one of *those* subreddits again.

My mouse zoomed and hovered over the button.

*click*

The page I was redirected to was the last thing I’d have imagined.

It had custom CSS. My face was plastered everywhere. I was shocked but in disbelief. I knew of the few subreddits for celebrities or certain humorous notoriety, *KyleSleeping* if I remember right- but this was different. This was me. And then I parsed the post titles as my eyes fixated on their titling.

##Weekly Megathread Discussion 87

##Woke up late [picture]

##Peed on the seat and didn’t close the lid, lol

##More weird videos again [link in comments]

##He’s Just so intriguing! Theory about newest girl

And on and on. What in the actual f- and then I noticed something even more disturbing. A link in the sidebar, written ‘Nightly Livestream Thread’

What The Fuck!

I jumped off my chair and stood in my room, still, scanning tentatively at the walls, corners, furniture. Are there cameras in here? I went to the window and pulled the curtain just enough. No one was outside. Good.

I went back to the computer. I clicked /new

##Discovered! Hi cwearly1 big fan! How’s life?

##Oh hello hope you see this! You’re so weird I can’t stop following!

##Compromised? Do we abort?

##Hey, you know there’s your Christmas gift in the linen closet? Can we see what it is?

I panicked. I called my friend. I needed to figure out if I’m being pranked hardcore, going insane, or- I just need someone to ground me.

He didn’t answer.

And then the cherry on top. I refreshed /new and saw the username of the most recent submission.

##Guys help I can’t tell him do I? [serious]
