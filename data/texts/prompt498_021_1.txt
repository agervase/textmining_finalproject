Jim laid back in his leather recliner and closed his eyes. A million thoughts swirled around his head. As the warm glow of the fire, crackling away in the stone fireplace, warmed his face.  
&nbsp;   
A million thoughts swirled around his mind as the familiar fog set in. He took a slow, deep breath.  
&nbsp;  
One...  
Two...  
Three...  
&nbsp;  
He exhaled, opening his eyes slowly to gaze into the honey colored liquid he slowly swirled around his glass. With a look of cautious determination, he raised the glass to his lips and finished what remained of his favorite whiskey.  
&nbsp;  
Jim had never been the biggest fan of drinking - always having either too much or not enough - yet his friends always insisted he join them for a night out on the town.   
&nbsp;  
His phone buzzed obnoxiously from the small coffee table in front of him - an antique gift left to him from his late grandfather, a distinguished navy captain.  
He begrudgingly reached for it.   
&nbsp;  

It was none other than Blackout Barry the menace. Not that Barry was ever really menacing... Jim had simply taken to calling him that due to his best friend's constant inclination to drink past his meager limit. Barry had always been a lightweight... yet that never stopped him from trying to increase his limit by drinking too much, too quickly.   
It was this fact, coupled with Jim always being the one to babysit his drunk friend, that resulted in Jim's ever-present reluctance to join his crew for a night of drinking and dancing. 
&nbsp;  
Jim answered the phone.  
&nbsp;  
"Hey Barry"  
&nbsp;  
"Bro! Are you ready to go yet?? We're almost to the front of the line! Hurry your ass up!" Barry yelled encouragingly.   
He always was the high energy sort.   
&nbsp;  
"Yeah, yeah. I hear ya bear. I'm just finishing my last drink then I'll be right there."  
&nbsp;  
"Great! Back that shit and reach already! We'll be in there by the time you get here, I'll save you a spot!"  
&nbsp;  
"Sure, sure. See you shortly."   
&nbsp;  
*beep*  
&nbsp;  
Jim hung up the phone with a sigh.   
Rising from his chair, he walked over and carefully closed the doors of the fireplace. His father had drilled the dangers of leaving an open fire, among many other "dangerous" activities, into him from a young age, so he always took his precautions.   
Once the doors were secured and the chance of the fire escaping its prison was reduced to zero, he picked up his glass and finished the last mouthful.  
&nbsp;  
But... something felt different.  
&nbsp;  
Jim could feel it immediately. It was as if... as if the haze had lifted - but not entirely. He felt.. energized. Alive.
