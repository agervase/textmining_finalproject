They say everything gets better with practice I guess I just didn't learn quick enough. What a shame it had to end like this though it could have been worse. I could have offed myself after Maggie died leaving our little girl to live in foster homes until she was eighteen. Course what kind of man would I be giving up when I had someone important depending on me. Now all I'm left with is my body cramping up and a god awful taste of sweet wine in my mouth, Maggie always hated sweet wines.

A few weeks ago the guys started getting on me about moving on from Maggie. She was dead and I had a little girl without a mama; every little girl needs a mama even if they ain't theirs. To throw them off my back I signed up on an one of those apps you always hear the older gents looking down on. Maybe they was just jealous that they didn't have that kinda thing when they was young, 'course Maggie always looked down on people who used it too, said it wasn't safe. Boy I wish she could see me now, she'd call me a damn fool.

All this started a few days ago when a pretty redhead named Shannon, who was visiting from outta town, matched with me. We got to talking and she seemed alright. She liked trucks, hunting, and classic rock same as me. So I got to talking a little more and we set a date to meet at the fancy bar downtown with the officer's discount. I got dressed in my Sunday best, pat the kid on the head, and grabbed my keys after searching for them for a whole thirty minutes. It was the first time since Maggie died that I lost my keys. She would always get on me about how I'm too forgetful and that one I'm gonna lose em' for good! The last Christmas she was around she got me a small gps keychain that I could find my keys with, it was a small piece of rubber that was barely noticeable, and I ain't lost since until today. Maybe that was a sign that I should have stayed home and called the whole thing off, boy I wish that I'd listen.

I met Shannon and she was the finest thing I've seen in a long long time. Her blue eyes popped from her snow white skin that made her look like she was made outta porcelain. Lucky me her personality was the opposite she was gruff, crude but not too crude, and she could take anybody in a fight. Kinda made me nervous but I shook it off, usually women like her are on the more delicate side but hey these times are different. We spent a few hours and a few dollars drinking til we were silly as all hell! The bar tender was about to kick us out when she suggested we go back to her place. Now I missed Maggie and all but I also missed the warmth of a woman. So I did what any other stupid guy does and said yes without any hesitation; after a quick phone call to the babysitter we were off to her place. Boy was I a damn fool.

&#x200B;

We got to her hotel room and the damn place looked like it hadn't even been slept in yet, she hadn't even taken the pamphlet off the bed. Course I shook the small red flag off and thought nothing of it, maybe she just liked it that way. Shannon set her purse on the table and took out a big bottle of wine, sweet wine. Instead of getting right at it she poured a glass for the two of us as a toast to our wonderful date. She went from laughing and carrying on to dead serious as soon as I put my empty wine glass down. Didn't take me too long before I could feel my body cramping up and my heart palpitating. Also didn't take her long to notice either.

&#x200B;

She got right in front of my face and smiled a smile that only the devil could have. "I'm going to freshen up, don't you go anywhere." Shannon disappeared behind the bathroom door with a sinister giggle.

I was dead as could be sitting there. All I could think about was my daughter and how Maggie would say that I was a goddamn fool for what I got myself into. Boy I wish she was hear right now, she always knew what to do. Hell she even got me a gps just because I was losing my damn keys all the time... the gps tracker. If there was no way outta this I was gonna damn well make that bitch pay for what she did to me and maybe many others. If I was gonna die I wasn't gonna let her get away with it. 

The cramps became worse as I fumbled with the key ring trying to get enough room to take the gps tracker off. I almost got it a few times but the damn thing slipped back, all the while I heard Shannon giggling behind the cheap hotel door. There wasn't much time but I finally freed the small black square and dropped it in her purse. That about took any strength I had left from my body and I felt my mind starting to go next. Thankfully the poison started getting to me before the painful part started. I remember her walking out of that bathroom but all I could see was Maggie, this time she wasn't calling me a damn fool.
