"Look at 'em, Randy."  The rag-shod throng trudged through the gates, shivering in the unforgiving Canadian winter. 

"Who are they, Mr. Lahey?" Randy took another bite of the cheeseburger from his pocket.

"Refugees, Randy. Refugees from ever-swirling shitnado that is this world." Lahey took a deep swig of hooch.

"Why are they in Sunnyvale, Mr. Lahey?"

"Well Randy, the government is paying us a shit-ton of money to house these people while they're processed for citizenship."

"That sounds great, Mr. Lahey! What will Berb do with the money?"

"I dunno.  Frankly, I don't give a shit.  Ordinarily, I'd feel sympathy for these people, but I don't."

"Why's that, Mr. Lahey?"

Jim Lahey took another deep swig, placing a mangled cigarette in his mouth.

"Because, Randy, it's like the old saying goes: *don't stand near shit-tracks if you hear the shit-whistle*.  These people, these *Americans*, chose to pollute their only home and go to war with every other goddamn country on earth.  They saw a shit-train barreling down the tracks, blowing its shit-whistle, and they fuckin stood right in front of it.  In this life, Randy, *urp* shit will find you no matter what you do.  I have nothing but sympathy for a man covered in shit.  Lord knows, I too am a man of shit.  I've spent my entire life wading through waves of shit.  **But goddammit, Randy, when the shit-balls fly, I don't let them hit me! I get my shit-bat and I take a swing!** These shit-brains piled their own shit up so high that they couldn't escape when the dam broke and a shit-flood overwhelmed them."

Lahey's drunken echoes bounced off the trees into the frosty air.  Off in the distance, he could hear a howling wind building in the mountains to the north, carrying one single word with it as a simple refrain of suffering - 

***SHIT***
