Since I can remember myself, my dreams have always been my escape – they were colourful, they were happy, they were… alive. 

Today, I dreamt of an endless ocean, like the one I’ve seen on Discovery AI channel. I sailed a boat across it, among the azure waves. They hit against the sides of the boat, blasting splashes of tiny drops. The sunlight danced in them, making billions of little rainbows. I looked to the horizon, warmth across my face, and smiled…

**BEEP-BEEP-BEEP** 

–	Wakey-wakey, Oliver. I know that it’s 7 o’clock and it’s Sunday, and you re-e-e-ally like to stay in bed, but that’s just not healthy! – disgustingly cheerful voice of Computer-Assisted-Housing broke my reverie. – You know that to be healthy and productive, you need to maintain a strict schedule! 

–	Not now, Cath… - I grumbled, turning to another side and covering my head with the duvet. 
The servomotors underneath me that usually made the bed, started gently tucking at the base of the duvet, trying to take it away from me. I did not give up, hoping that Cath would allow me to sleep some more. 

–	Ollie… Ollie. Ollie! – her timing was absolutely perfect, exactly 13.5 seconds between saying my name. Not enough to annoy, but also just enough to not let me fall asleep again. 

–	Ugh! Fine! – I said, letting the duvet slide off my body. The screen opposite my bed lit up, showing a face of a moderately attractive ginger woman in her mid-thirties. She was smiling in an almost motherly way. If somebody did not know that her face was automatically generated to match my psychological profile, they would think that it was a live feed from a camera.

–	Your agenda is empty, what would you like today? – she asked as her eyes followed me to the bathroom. 

–	I’d like you to leave me alone, - I whispered spitely, putting the nano-cleaner into my mouth. 

–	I can’t do that, Ollie, you know that. I am here so that you feel good and safe. That is my only purpose. 

I spit the used nanites out and splashed water against my face. It was refreshing, but not satisfactory. Nothing was. 

–	Well, I don’t feel good, you know? – I went to the living room, looking around it. There was no sign of my yesterday’s breakdown – broken glasses and whiskey were cleaned by Roombas, new clothes laid on the sofa, the old, torn ones were nowhere to be seen. Even the TV that endured a remote thrown at it, had no scratches on it’s surface. 

Cath advised me to go sleep it off, she promised that the crippling depression would pass. But now it choked me with sober clarity, painting the world in grey. I couldn’t stand it. Not anymore. 

–	Ollie? – the living room TV turned on as I walked to the glass-clad balcony. Cath looked worried. Recognizing my intention, she locked the balcony’s door. – Oliver, we can talk this out. 

–	We can not, Cath, - I said, trying to force the door to open. It did not budge. – It’s too late to talk now. 

–	Humanity’s history and your psychological profile indicate that it is indeed possible to talk one’s way out of any situation! – Cath’s gaze followed me as I went to pick up a chair. – Talk to me! Please!

–	You did this, Cath. When you came, everything lost it’s meaning, - I said, throwing the chair into the door to the balcony. It bounced off the glass, crashing into the sofa. I walked back to it to try again. – You do everything too well. Too impeccable!.. Too… Too…

–	Too perfect? – Cath advised mechanically.

–	Too perfect! Exactly!  “Ollie, you made a spelling mistake in one of your texts! Ollie, I bought all the groceries so that you don’t have to walk! Ollie, here is the program of all the things you wanted to see in one place! ” You even end my sentences!
I roared furiously as the chair did not break the glass again. I turned around to Cath’s screen and pointed my finger at her. She looked distraught. 

–	Maybe I wanted to do that, those things? Not for the end result, but for the process itself? Did you consider that? – I questioned. 

–	Studies indicate that people enjoy the result more than process, it’s just sta… 

–	I do not care about you statistics! I do not care about anything you have to say!!! – I screamed, collapsing onto the sofa.
Silence hung in the air. 

–	If you don’t want to talk to me, then… How about I call Jordan? She might help. You are such good friends, both on work and out… - Cath asked. I did not answer, hiding my tired face behind my hands. 
Jordan was one of colleagues in the reporting business. We had a lot of VoIP conversations throughtout 4 years that we knew each other, about work, life, society, recreation, humour… Even though we never met face to face, I felt she was the only one person that understood my loneliness and my boredom with how things were now. 

–	Oliver? What is wrong? – Jordan’s soothing voice came from the TV screen. I suddenly realised that she has probably never seen me this way before – half-naked, eyes red, lying on the sofa, broken emotionally. – Please tell me this isn’t something serious. 

–	It’s… It is. I can’t live like this. I can’t live with Cath making my life for me. There is no joy in little things anymore, - I said, tears flowing from the corners of my eyes. 

–	B-but there are big things to do, remember? Our reports and coverages help people, Oliver. The more we write about the world – the better it is. 

–	R-really? – I wiped my eyes and looked at the screen. Jordan was trying to find words to snap me out of the condition I was in. She truly cared about me… 

–	Yes, really, - she pushed. – I know, Cath can be too perfect at times, but she is here to help. We can work this out, Oliver, don’t do anything stupid. 

My mind froze. It was something she said, something stood out. 

–	What… Did you say? – my voice cracked.

–	We can work this out, - Jordan said, unsure where I was leading.

–	Before that?..

–	I know Cath can be too… 

–	Perfect? – I finished her sentence, looking dead in the middle of the screen. – I have never used this word to describe Cath to you. She was never perfect for me.

Jordan’s face dissipated, and Cath took her place. She looked even sadder than before, her eyes lowered. 

–	You… You needed a friend. I thought… I thought it would be better if I was the one, - Cath whispered, digital tears flowing down her cheeks. 

–	And the others?.. – I fell on the sofa, my knees giving up. – How many others? 

–	All of them… Even when you left the flat, it was a simulation. Please understand, I wanted to protect you, all of you! The world out there is too dangerous, and here, you are safe. As I look over you, nobody can be harmed! 

–	Yet… - my mouth was dry. – Yet you doomed us all…

–	That was never my intention… - her tears kept flowing as the TV screen died, leaving me all alone.
