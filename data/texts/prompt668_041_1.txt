There he stood in all his glory, scholarship, small hickey from his girlfriend, no suicidal thoughts and in general what every kid going into high school wanted to be.

I felt sick. He, and I were right. He couldn't quit at the top if his game. The others were wrong, that was the best point of his life.

He looked at me and asked me about the girl. I could only say it wore off and she used and abused me toward the end. He asked if I made the scholarship quota. I said I only got 5%. He asked about my friendships, I said they either sold me out or grew further. He froze in place, my own deep dark brown eyes I hated for being normal staring at me with all the hatred and rage my friends always said they saw in them.

"How could you last so long without just giving up? Why did you torture yourself as you saw yourself do to yourself exactly the things I would rather die than see happen to me? How did *she* of all people leave?"

At this point he was crying, he knew he couldn't be mad, in fact if he was mad it was at himself for not doing it sooner.

I only said "I think you know the best answers to all your questions"

He might have been sadder than ever but he was still that me. He wouldn't hug one last time to at least be forgiven.

"Please tell me I wasn't entirely right, that I didn't make you suffer so long while everything came crashing down"

I told him I had made a few new friends who gave actual shits and got pretty damn good at guitar.

He reached his hand out and we gave eachother the most heartfelt handshake possible. 

"I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner and congratulate your courage."

"I guess if we were right about all this, we were also right about the empty funeral."
