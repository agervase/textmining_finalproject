Tuesday was the day Marian went to the Hair salon. It was the first time in a long time that she had left her dorm, and I was stuck monitoring an empty room. Despite the implications of being without her for a few hours, I was proud of her for finally deciding to leave the room after that nasty breakup. Marian is dependable, and honest, one of the best people I’ve ever actually never met before. Being an NSA agent, it was standard custom nowadays to monitor the public. They knew about it, we knew about it. Everyone knows the government is not so secretly spying on everyone. And Marian had a slight suspicion that there was someone watching her. I could hear her voicing her complaints to her mother through the keurig \(She didn’t trust her computer, or her phone. It was very hard having to track her all the way to Kokoma, Nebraska just to listen in on that little conversation she decided to have.\) 

It was all worth it though. Marian was my whole livelihood now. I don’t hate my job as much as I used to, not when I can listen to her voice, and laugh at all of her silly texts. She really is a wonderful girl. And if circumstances were different, I have no doubt we’d be amazing friends. Maybe lovers, if I was bolder. 

Wednesday was the day she returned to the dorm. Midterms were coming it seemed. I remembered midterms when I was in college. I’ve recently made it out, but Marian is close behind. I don’t know what she wants to do afterward, and I’m more than sure that she isn’t sure either. Personally, given her kindness and empathy towards others, veterinarian or nurse seems to be a perfect match for her. Despite her nice personality, I’ve seen a side to her that I can only describe as “Problematic”. She’s very shy, for one thing. Her shyness played a big part in her behaviour on tuesday. And she can be short tempered when it comes to plain ignorance. 

Those discrepancies are not enough to blind me though.
