I bore this burden my entire life and so did my mother and her mother before her... souls roamed these empty street and homes, once living humans with feelings and memories and probably a family that loved them. The roaming spirits I usually see beg and plead for me to say their final good-byes or to act revenge apon their killer. One has even asked me to join them.              I was a child, I could not do what they asked of me. After death they never seemed to realize I still had a life of my own that still had time to live in. So I ignored their pleads. I rarely went outside, but of course when I had to go for my job or groceries I wore dark sun glasses and made sure to never make eye contact. Even a single pause could give you away. But I had years of learning and soon they ignored me too. I could be apart of the living again.                                                             __________________________________________________ I didn’t plan for this morning. Nobody could have know what would happen. I hadn’t seen one in almost a year. So when I saw the stranger that had just died moments ago appear as a spirit I was... didn’t expect this to happen. I stared in shocked as the mass of people began to surround the body in curiosity and worry. His body was slumped in his car. It was Nick. I knew him. He was the guy who made everyone try to laugh at my accounting job. He had a fiancé and was getting his masters degree in the spring. Even dead he still look the same, his skin was still warm and colored. Without the bullet wound to the head you would have never know that he was dead. But they were too late. As was I. Those few seconds of me staring at him had more than showed him I saw him.                                                                                  “I’m so, so sorry... I-I just... wasn’t looking.”                                                                                   He seemed to be calm. His shoulders were relaxed and even as he stared at his corpse he didn’t react in anyway. No screaming? No pleading? No denial?                All he did was stare blankly at his own corpse.                        I didn’t know if he was plainly crazy or knew this would happen, but I wanted no part in when he had questions.                                                                                           Without looking back I grabbed my purse and walked home in my bloodied shirt. No one had dared to talk to me. Maybe it was because they knew I had been through enough or maybe I just didn’t seem as interesting as the dead man. The walk home I didn’t dare turn around almost as if I was still at the scene. With a shaky hand I reached in my pocket to pull out my phone. But it wouldn’t run on. Weird.                                   I bumped into a woman and looked up to apologize but realized she was frozen in place. As I slowly looked around I realized everybody was.                                               “Janice.”, said a calm voice behind me.                                   There was Nick, he was on the verge of tears it looked like.                                                                                                 “Ah, two? The more the merrier I suppose.”, said a new voice.                                                                                                   I looked to see a man in a dark purple cloak holding a golden sythe above my head. With my reflexes I dodged just as the golden weapon lodged itself into the concrete besides me.                                                              “Stop it! She isn’t dead!”, said the spirit with a sudden new force in his voice.                                                                      The purple cloaked crazy man looked back at me with furrowed eyebrows and with ease pulled his weapon back to his side.                                                                               “She dodged my weapon. I know that she can see us. Uh, right?”                                                                                       “You seem pretty unsure of that. Can you maybe, I don’t know, HAVE A CONVERSATION INSTEAD!”                                                                                  The crazy man looks at me in surprise at this.                       “Usually I never get such sassy responses. With being death and all.”                                                                                   The crazy man looks at me in curiosity now and takes a step towards me.                                                                             I stiffen with the sudden realization that he called himself death. As much as I would love to be in denial, my mother told me stories of death. He played by his rules and had been known to strike a deal when tempted. He was a terrible being to not be messed with. He was a man who hides in the shadows that springs onto his prey, then ‘helps’ lost souls to the afterlife. Not to mention the years I spent tormented by the burden of poor souls who were ripped of life so early was all his fault. Now he was here to reap this man’s soul...                                                                          “What business does a low life like your’s have doing trying to kill an innocent person. You never mess with Fate.”                                                                                                     “Oh my... This is quite amusing. So you didn’t notice?”    The spirit begins to burst into tears, never making eye contact with me.                                                                       “I’m so sorry. I-It’s my fault.”                                                         I look up in confusion at death. How was this spirit’s death my business at all?                                                                               “Your dead, sweetie. And from my guess you’re friend here had one too many before he hit you.”
