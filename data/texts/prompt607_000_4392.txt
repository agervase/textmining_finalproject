Some are lesser.

Some are greater.

I am above.

Long did I wander before I finally settled. A simple world, filled with the sort of promise that is so rare within creation. I came to it when it was still fresh. From the promise of this world I forged a paradise. A single spark of life became a broad creation, filled with majesty and diversity. With great care I guided this life along the myriad paths.

There were mistakes. I am a God, but I'm not perfect.

The dinosaurs were real dicks. I had to hit a hard reset on that one.

Mammals were a bit more promising. A few nudges along the evolutionary path combined with eternal patience finally produced something worthy of my efforts. I admired their tenacity, their capacity for overcoming the hardships of that the world naturally set in their path. Their discovery of fire, writing and higher order technology all brought cheer to my heart.

The time to reveal myself had finally come. After hundreds of millions of years, my creation would know me. Know that they were not alone in the world. In the universe.

I chose my moment carefully.

I descended from the heavens, largely because that is what their religious texts all expected me to do, and announced myself. I sat on a mighty golden throne, a brilliant halo about my head, feeling appropriately godly.

My introduction did not go as a planned. At first I was mocked. Laughed at. They thought me an imposter. An insane piece of detritus that had decided to put on a performance for their amusement.

I recognize now that placing my golden throne in New York City's Time Square on New Year's Eve was a tactical error. I just figured everyone was there, the cameras were rolling and people were already in a celebratory mood so it'd be one of those win/win setups. Alas, it was not meant to be.

The miscalculation put me into the position of either accepting their insolence or demonstrating my power. My effort to build goodwill with my creation was somewhat set back by my decision to smite all of those who mocked me. Again, I am enlightened enough to recognize this as a strategic miscalculation in hindsight. Living is about learning and I learned a lot.

Of course, all of the smiting led to something of an escalation on their part. Guns. Tanks. At one point a nuke detonated right in the middle of Manhattan. Such trivial devices had little effect on me, though it substantially reduced the quality of life within the city itself. All of that valuable real estate. Poof. Gone.

Now, I wish I could say that I turned the other cheek, but I had been covertly building a real estate portfolio in the city so the nuke rubbed me the wrong way. That and the fact that I was just nuked. Bad form, that. Completely unnecessary. I was angered.

You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

So there was more smiting. A lot of smiting. Before I really got back to my senses, I'd managed to smite the a fair bit of the human population. Something like half of them. Maybe seventy five percent. A lot. It doesn't matter. What matters is that I've realized that that was operational oversight.

Godly. Not perfect.

At this point, things had soured rather severely between me and humanity. Mistakes were made on both sides, I think we're all mature enough to recognize this now, but all of that smiting had set civilization back a fair bit. It might have something to do with me releasing a global electro\-magnetic pulse after a particularly annoying hit piece on 60 minutes, but I really couldn't say. Point is that they're back in the Bronze Age. Possibly Stone Age.

The point is that pretty much all the humans are dead and they ones that remain have been acquired some rather odd superstitious beliefs. I can understand how the appearance of a god and the subsequent eradication of eighty five percent of the population could cause some radical shifts in policy, but I'm a bit disappointed at the regression.

By far the most annoying development has been the 'Chosen Ones.'

Somehow the rumor got started that I could be defeated by a child of the purest heart. It might have been the one time I joked early on that only a child of the purest heart could defeat me. But that was clearly in jest. Humans have a terrible sense of humor, particularly when ninety percent of them have been slaughtered by a vengeful god. Maybe if they'd lighten up, we wouldn't be in this mess.

A little more communication, a little less annihilation.

So now, every year, some teenager get dumped off on the border of my domain \-\- I rebuilt Manhattan after the nuke, there's a lot of money in redevelopment \-\- and instructed to defeat me.

I've tried explaining to them that I've grown from my mistakes. That despite creating them, I'm really not good with people. That it's been as difficult for me as it has been for them. That this is a teachable moment. Sadly, the humans are quite short on empathy. It may be because I smote ninety five percent of the population, but they should really move on. All of that destruction was so 2000 and late.

Now I got some brat tromping about my backyard, messing up my garden, and waving around a sword. It always goes the same way:

"Hello my child," I say, all warm and benevolent like.

"I am the Chosen One! Sent from \[completely interchangeable human tribe here\], come to end your vile reign."

"Listen, friend, that's all behind us."

"You killed ninety seven percent of humanity\-\-"

"\-\-a logistical snafu, I've grown since then," I reply, with the eternal patience that I have worked so very hard to re\-acquire after all of these misunderstandings.

Then there's a great deal of yelling and whooping as the kid charges me. I cannot tell you what a downer it is to disintegrate a child every year. Other than providing excellent fertilizer for my lilies, there's no upside in it. There's just an emotional toll that it takes to be so chronically misperceived. You try to build bridges, and people just come along and burn them down.

I suppose that's all you can expect when you've destroyed ninety nine percent of humanity.
