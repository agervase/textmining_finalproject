At first, we figured the 'Skycean' was Armageddon.  Hippies called it Mother Nature's Cleansing.  Eventually, physicists calculated a possible 4 dimensional solution.  Apparently, some sort of fourth dimensional rift made it *appear* as if water was disobeying the laws of physics, but it was just a one in a quintillion spacetime rift. 

But, you'd be surprised how quickly humans and nature itself adapt.  

As this bizarre reality finally settled into people's minds, drastic change occurred all at once.  To avoid planet-wide unrest, many nations used the UN to share research and data.  Meteorologists, environmental experts, and physicists gathered the myriad of data points pitched in from an inexhaustibly long list of sources: military navies from practically every country, trade ships, submarines, weather stations from practically every land mass on Earth, weather balloons, etcetera.  And with it, they used deep learning to develop a very accurate model with some terrifying predictions.  As news spread, more research only further confirmed the absurd fact that rain was slowing and would eventually stop entirely.  

I'd like to digress a bit to discuss how religious figures reacted.  The Pope surprisingly was rather cautious.  I remember dropping my spoon when I heard on the news that the Pope said that this was likely, not Rapture.  He simply asked for increased prayers.  Many disagreed.  Christians, Jews, Muslims, weirdos from every belief, including Atheists began suddenly revising their reading of their 'holy' texts to proclaim that this was in fact rapture.  

"After reading Revelation chapter seven, we see that the number of syllables in the chapter coincides with the ASCII binary translation to water...."  

"Actually, Noah's Ark was a precursory tale to..."

And so on.  

But where people saw catastrophe, I saw an opportunity to get ridiculously rich.  I quit my investor job and liquidated every asset I had to do several things at once.  First, I made bogus, 'Skycean', Apocalyptic, religious, mumbo-jumbo crap: Umbrellas with crosses,  Water from my sink which I repackaged into 'holy rain', and whatever crap I could cheaply make and sell to these idiots.  Let me tell you: I made a killing.  People handed me the deeds to their homes and blessed me for it too.  I often struggled not to laugh.  

Second, I purchased certain things that were going for much lower market value.  I purchased farming equipment from those abandoning the places in the Midwest like Montana.  I actually liked the folks there, so I insisted on marking up the prices and insisted they give me their contact information.  I looked at the findings of open weather model that NASA released and suspected I would need them later.  

Third, I tracked down people and information.  I paid premiums on meteorology textbooks, architecture, and naval design.  Anything involved with the weather, the ocean, and the navy I wanted.  I stole books from the public library once regretfully.  I called and tried to get a hold of as many architects, scientists, and researchers that I could get a hold of.  


--Part Two--

After the first few months, things settled down.  Many of my customers from my religious paraphernalia business came back embarrassed or angry to hide their embarrassment.  I closed shop and hired a few good lawyers to defend my case.  With no money to pay their own lawyers, my customers either eventually gave up or did something brash which got them shot by my guards.  

And as more and more rain hovered in the air, the oceans shrank.  Years of sea level rising backpedaled and then some.  Rapidly, what was once covered by the ocean became crossable.  Naval industries tanked further making my cautious purchases cheaper and cheaper.  However, farming equipment demands that once tanked went back up.  I, unfortunately, did not suspect how popular rice would be in these saltwater paddies.  Chinese scientists had recently developed rice that could grow in saltwater. With few modifications, it became the go-to produce across the world in these new shoreline farms.  I still rolled in further wealth by selling back my farm equipment and hiring back farmers I kept in touch with.  But, all I could think of was the profit I **could** have made if I just thought of what produce would have been used in these lands.  Behind stealing books from the library and not charging more for my religious trinkets, it was my third largest regret in my life.  

Luckily, as months became years my third action would come into fruition.  Scientists with their models predicted that the ocean below and the ocean above would occasionally connect during storms to form these  several-stadium-long pillars.  Instead of raining, water would fall back down through these "pillars."  What's really going on is effectively one massive raindrop from what I could understand from my readings. If you put flat plates close to each other and pour water on the top one,  the water "pillars" instead of dripping if the plates are sufficiently close enough.  For a lot of chemical and physical reasons, this is the way it "rains" now.  

I won't deny that this whole 'Skycean' falling back down to Earth doesn't scare me.  All life even aquatic would perish.  Despite my religious exploits, a rain cult formed and still attracts followers to this day.  Nevertheless, I refused to let fear dictate my actions.  Instead of fearing the unknown, why not go forth and see?  

Teams of explorers were sent to the 'Skycean.'  Many religious and environmental terrorists were shot and killed during this period.

"You'll break the bubble!  You'll shred the equilibrium."

"Don't breach, Mother Bubble! Please! You'll doom us all with the Great Collapse!"  

But, neither of those things happened.  Instead, what we found was a whole new biome.  Fish and other aquatic wild-life migrated during those "pillars" I mentioned earlier.  Not only that, these animals were evolving far more rapidly than ever imagined.  The wildlife were exposed to more astronomical rays which spurred faster genetic mutation.  Naval exploration of the Skycean grew rapidly.  Again, I was there to happily sell them back old equipment for much higher prices.  Even better, I managed to build the first skyport in the world.  By building a large enough tower, I could send submarines and ships up into the Skycean from this tower and it could drop supplies **anywhere** in the world.  Soon, the Air Force was renamed the 'Aery'.

Afterword:

So, I thought I'd give a little explanation to my prompt.  I've been reading The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham and was amazed: here was a person who trusted his numbers despite the insane economic rollercoaster that happened in his time.  I was really sick of prompts that were all flowery prose and shock value.  I felt like each prompt was a world and its interesting implications were being wasted instead of being delved in, so I thought having a calm, cool, merchant character would really put an interesting spin.  This character doesn't ask, "How can I survive?" but rather "How can I thrive?"  I hope you enjoyed my post and sorry for the lengthy afterword.
