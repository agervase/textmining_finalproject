"Where am I?" It is dark. It is dark and I'm all alone. Where am I? Where's my best friend? Weren't we ...?  
"You are in the time after." The voice is like smooth velvet in the black. "You know: *Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.* You have passed away and it is time to move on or go back."  
I look around, but can't discern anything, but now I remember. An axe. My best friend next to me. His head. My head. Oh god ... "I'm dead?"  
"You are," the deep, soothing voice whispers back. It's next to my ear a thousand miles away. ""I am afraid it's curtains for you."  
"Take a last bow ..." I can't hear my own voice. "What now? Do I become a ghost to plague my children? Go to heaven?"  
The voice is all around. "There is an after, but what it is ... You must find out for yourself. If you call the coin toss wrong."  
"Coin toss?" Something tugs at my memory. There was something about coins. "What coin toss?"  
"Everyone plays this game." Death - for that's what the voice is, that much is clear - makes a light appear in front of me, showing nothing but a silver coin suspended in the air. "Heads - or tails. Call it right, I send you back." He, or it, groans. "You have done this many times, and always you forget."  
"Coins ..." Coins, there was something ... I think back, but it's tough to remember anything. I think of my friend. Didn't we gamble for coins? We should have never gone to England. Then, a flash of memory. "Heads."  
The voice is sharper now. "You always play heads. Why? Why do you always play heads?"  
"Heads," I say, more confidently. "Heads." An axe. My best friend. A letter. Beheaded.  
"As you wish," the voice says, aggravated. The coin spins. And spins. Settles. "Heads," the voice concedes. "You go back."  
And suddenly, in a flash, I remember. How many times have we done this? Not a single time was different, like another rehearsal of the same scene ... We always end up with the executioner's axe cutting through our necks. "No, make it tails," I want to call out, but I'm already sucked back. I never had a choice. It'll repeat forever.  
And in the end, the same end will come and an ambassador will announce in Denmark ... That the king's supposed command is fulfilled, that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
