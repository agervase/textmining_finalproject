Petrov looked about him as the dust of the newly formed crater fell around him. It had worked, Yuri's tracktor and Gurri's rope and given him enough velocity to git to mars. Petrov had nothing but a track suit and pack of cigurrets. Petrov whiped out his pole and planted his flag. mars belonged to him now. Teim for celeration. Petrov pulled out the vodka to take a jolly swing.

Much to his dismay the vodak began to fully evaporate in the absence of an atmosphere. The bottle was DEAD.

Petrov squated is second to last squat, and took the power of his legs and rocketed up. Even in the lower gravity of space this would not get him home. But in his mind he had a single thought. If he could not live in mars then no one would. His jump had put him into a near perfect orbit, but it was decaying. As petrov soared over the red mountains and valleys mars. As he skimmed the thin atmophere he had stollen just enough particles to light his last cig.

Petrov only chuckled, the core had gone nuclear.
