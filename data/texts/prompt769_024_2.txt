The Devil grinned as he opened the door to a seemingly normal house.The door opens without so much as a sound. he hold the door open for me and I walk in hesitantly, not knowing what to expect. The interior was as plain as the exterior.

I look back at the Devil, still smiling, he gestured for me to look around. He hadn't explained anything since I arrived. No matter how pleadingly I asked him to explain what was going on and why was I reverted to being a toddler, he only smiled his pleasant smile. I walk further into the house. The hallway had pictures of my favorite memories that were never captured on any camera. One shows when my boyfriend had asked me to be his girlfriend, another shows my 21st birthday celebration with my friends, all of us messes but happy. I turn away as tears well up in my eyes and I feel a pain in my chest as I remember the moment I died.

*"Call an ambulance please!" I can hear the gasps of women and the quiet of men. "Why won't any of you move? Please help me!" My brother shouts in despair, I hear his voice crack. I force my eyes open. I see my brother, tears running down his cheeks, he's still pleading and suddenly I'm conscious of his hands holding my body up and close to his own. I notice my blood soaking his shirt. I try to tell him that it's okay, that I'm okay, that it has been done and I need to go. I'm unable to speak, let alone move. A dull pain throbs and throbs throughout my body. My brother has his eyes locked on mine, he repeats my name again and again. His tears warm my cheeks and I realize how cold I feel. I close my eyes and think, this is the first and last time I will ever feel my brother this close to me. I sigh.*

The Devil comes up behind me. He looks huge from a toddler's perspective and I instinctively flinch. He puts a hand on my shoulder and guides me further into the house. More pictures of memorable moments in my life. Pleasant little house, cozy, and I realize it has the same layout as my parent's house. We go into the main living space. It has a sofa and two recliners, a glass coffee table and a flat screen TV. I look up at the Devil once again. Confused, again. He looks down and smiles yet again. He sits me down on the sofa and turns on the TV.

As soon as it is switched on, I see a mother in labor, her face is scrunched in pain and I hear a man's voice excitedly commentating. I see a man by the mother's bed, holding her hand, which I assume is the father. "Oh and I think she is coming out very soon! I think you can see just the top of her head coming on out! And... and, she's here! She's finally here!" I see the baby being pushed out and the doctor is gently coaxing it out. I see everyone's faces break into smiles as the baby appears fully healthy out of the mother. The parents are ecstatic and it shows on their faces. The man's voice returned with such gusto and said, "And her mother already has a name for her: Courtney. And so, this is how Courtney Johnson was born." My head snaps to look at the Devil. "What is the deal with this? Why is there footage of this? Why am I watching this? And why the hell are **you** commentating on it?" I freak out for a moment and my voice returns to its normal nonchalant tone. "Explain it now, why don't you? Please?"

He smiles again, it looks more sinister than before and I resist an urge to flinch. He looks into my eyes --I swear he sees my fear, my flaws, every disturbing detail of me. "This, is your life's documentary. And I, am your commentator. During your time here, you'll be watching your life play out and I'll be right there to comment on all your mistakes and praise your good actions. And since you weren't due for death yet, you'll be seeing how your life was supposed to play out after that recent point in your life. Once you've finished watching this, you'll be able to be sorted out to go to Heaven or stay here in eternal damnation, with me! Our reception here is pretty busy and we need a couple more decades to get to you... oh, of course, actual damnation isn't so comfortable. It's really a lot more screaming and pain for... well, forever. You got that?" He smiles as he moves closer to me on the sofa. "You look so cute with your eyes so full of fear and tears," he commented. I became aware of my breathing turn shallow, my heart beat climb, my hands gripping the fabric of the sofa. Suddenly, everything felt more real than just now. He broke out laughing --childlike, bright and clear. "Relax, sweetie. I can't do anything to you yet. After a little more time, and if you get sorted into my dominion, **then**, you'll be able to understand true pain." A phone rings and he looks embarrassed, "Sorry, I need to take this." He takes a phone out of his back pocket and puts the phone to his ear. The Devil grimaces for the first time since I arrived. 

He stands up, once again towering over me. "Well, guess I have to go. It's been fun seeing a little preview of your face of fear, darling. See you, a little later than I expected." His face breaks into a smile again and blew me a kiss. He disappeared, as if he was never there in the first place. A moment of confusion takes over my head, my thoughts filled with his last sentence. I turn back to the TV and see myself as a baby in my mother's arms. I get up from the sofa and sit right in front of the television. I whisper longingly, "Mom. Dad." I put a hand on the screen as I feel tears drip down my chin. 

I sit there with my hand on the screen. The commentating drones on and on. Monotonous, rising in volume at some points, getting excited at others, sad at other points. I sit and sit, staring at the screen, listening to the commentating. I reminisce and remember my childhood memories which were lost to me as I grew. Suddenly, I realize my hands have grown a little bigger. I look down and see my body has grown as well. I look back to the screen, which shows me as a three-year-old kindergartner running around with my friends. I rush to find a mirror. I find one in the bathroom and look at my reflection. I recognize my face as a three-year-old, exactly like on the screen. An overwhelming nausea floods me, my sight blurs and I taste acidic vomit in my mouth. I close my eyes as I vomit into the sink. When I open my eyes again, I see my boyfriend's worried face staring at me. He called out for a nurse, his face resembled my brother when I was lying on the road right before meeting the Devil, pained and despairing. **Wait. What?** 

I was attended to by nurses and a doctor and my boyfriend was sent outside. There was such a commotion happening, I was still trying to understand what was happening. *Why did I wake up at a hospital? How am I still alive?* A smiling doctor sits next to my bed as the nurses leave. He patiently explained my situation to me. "You've been in a coma for three years, Ms Johnson." At that, I tuned out from everything else he said. Everything made more sense. I was *brain* dead, not truly dead. *That's* why the Devil said that, *"See you, a little later than I expected."* As soon as the doctor opened my room's door, my boyfriend, family and friends rushed in, enveloping me in their arms and crying with relief. I smile. I feel warmth, happiness, relief. I cry with them. 

*I'm home.*
