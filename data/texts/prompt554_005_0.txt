Clarence pointed his rifle at the two Canucks with one hand, and waved a miniature American flag with the other.  
"Stay back!" he roared, "Ya may have got alla everybody else fooled but ya ain't foolin' old Clarence, oh no, nosiree!"  
Jacque stepped forward, hands up, docile as the loon on a loonie. "I do not know what you're talking about, Monsieur, I promise you are mistaken. I am clearly just an innocent Quebecois who ever-so-happened to stumble across you here, I definitely was not, how did you say, *hunting* you, oh no, not *moi*, not Jacque!"  
Clarence fired a warning shot that was a bit too enthusiastic, opening a small hole in Jacque's tuxedo. Canadian Tuxedo, that is.  
The other Canadian, Dave, because of course his name was Dave, stepped away from Jacque's side, attempting to circle the enraged American. "Hey, hey, *hey* now there buddy, why don't you put down the old widow-maker and let's talk this through like the caring neighbours we are? We don't mean you any harm, and I know you really don't want to hurt us, eh?"  
Clarence scratched furiously at his forehead, looking back and forth at the two as they circled him. Was he overreacting? Could it honestly be a misunderstanding? They seemed like nice enough fellows, and-  
*Whack*  
He hit the ground with a thud. He saw stars, the trees above him, then Jacque's grinning face entered his vision, wielding a canoe paddle.  
From what seemed like kilometres away, he heard Dave yell, "Sorry, Clarence, Pardon my FRENCH!"  
His vision blurring, Clarence saw Jacque's grin turn into an angry snarl, and he spit to the side.  
"Oh, c'mon," he heard Dave say, "I couldn't resist. C'mon. Jacque, come back. Come back, Jacque! Hey! C'mon man you got the only damn paddle!"  
Clarence closed his eyes. *Goddamit*, he thought, *I goddamn knew it*.
