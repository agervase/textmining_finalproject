While my owner sleeps I stealthily turn on his iPad and silently paw through one video after an another.     


After finding no obvious rhyme or reason for what succeeds on youtube I decide to use a more scientific method. 


It took a few nights to learn the basics of coding but my little program was finally ready. I feed it  a list of the one hundred channels with the most subscribers, manually entered the link to every single video with over 10 million views and every single video that was classified under trending during the past six months.


The program alerted me that the statistic calculations will require  167 hours, 32 minutes and 50 seconds to complete. 


Pawing the accept button I had the program work in the background. For one week I felt tense. work never bothered me much. It's the anxiety, the fear of being found out, of the batteries draining. All of it showed on my health as I started to white tuffs of fur like it was nobody's business. My Owner, bless him, even took me to the vet and footed that disgraceful bill they forced on him just so some fancy arse with a face closer to a rat then a human would bestow on him the words "Oh, must be seasonal shedding. Just make sure he eats well and it'll be fine in a week or two."

Even I knew that was code for "Don't know but I didn't go through five million years of schooling to say that." 


My poor owner spent so much money on vitamins, special shampoo and fancy cat food that I didn't have the heart to refuse any of it. Garbage the lot of it and cat food isn't fit for a dog! 

I kept my eyes on the iPad, checking it's batteries and the program's progress whenever I could. Soon, dear owner, very soon. 


On the day the program had completed it's analysis a new channel was registered on Youtube and three videos were uploaded to it.
