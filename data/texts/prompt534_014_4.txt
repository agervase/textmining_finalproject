"aaand Action! " 

This is it. Finally after spending my childhood im drama classes and acting camps, I have my first real acting role.

Russian Farmer No 3. Well its not a starring role and its got no lines but its a start and I'm excited. 

So here I am, waiting off camera for my part..Cue,  farmers wife... Cue daughter... Cue farmer 1.
That part has lines..well, one line.


"Cut!.. What the hell.. This guys meant to have been working im the field! Props! Get here now! " 

Uh oh. pissed off Director. Not good. This guys been known to throw coffee cups. I duck behind some scenery until he calms down. 

"I dont care what the problem is.. Get this farmer his bloody tools!"

Suddenly there's knock from a nearby door. A fake door, part of the set, maybe Victorian England.. I cant tell. 

Of course I open it, I mean its showbiz! Every doors an Opporunity! And the Director is still yelling, Props department are still scrambling. What else. i got to do. 

I open the door.. Theres a guy dressed in a halloween costume. Kind of like Scream but way better quality. So realistic.. Which means big budget, and maybe bigger roles.

"yo,  Dude sick costume. What set you from? I heard they got a couple of shows filming today, I would love to get into a horror once this wraps"

The guys saying nothing.. Maybe its muffled, I these silicone masks can be pretty big. 

He thrusts something into my hands. i have no idea what it is. Long stick with a kind of blade. 

"ah what am I meant to do with-"

"you there! Farmer at the back with the Scythe. Get up here now! You're now Farmer 1- I assume you know the line. "

"Places everyone. Aaaand Action! "
