The bush sitting before you literally calls to you. 

"HEY, HEYYY, HELLLL-OOOOO! Fuck, if this one walks away too, I'll.. I-I'll..."

*the little shrub breaks down sobbing, and you feel as if you can see leaves shake with every barking moan* 

"Whoa, uh.. c-calm down?" you say, albeit a bit questioningly. You've never told a bush to calm down before aside from that one inanimate one which attacked you, drunk, outside that Shondiz in Phuket. 

The shaking and cries stop abruptly. 

In an instant you feel your insides squirm outwards, in a metaphorical sense. Your brain turns all of its sensors on high alert, your heart rate quickens, and the hairs on the back on your neck salute in the most vividly Kampf'ish way you've ever felt. Like a sprite (recently discovered) had fletched miniature arrows and left them sticking perfectly perpindicular from the nape of your neck for easy access. 

Something is looking directly at you, sifting through the haze and murk of the inner parts of your soul. You can feel a tart yet warm presence leaving tendrils of consciousness writhing through your body. 

"y-YOU'RE HERE!" - the voice echoes through your mind, more crimson and sheen than before. The voice's volume sounded nearly as loud as a jet engine in your psyche, yet there was no pain. Only warmth, and comfort. 

"W-Who are you?! Show yourself!" you scream at the top of your lungs. You give the bush a sidelong look as you glance around the grand hall. 

"I think you know, fool. You're looking right at me, trying to pass it off like I don't know you've made the connectio- Don't. Don't point at the shiny greatsword, you'll just embarrass yourself trying to wield it. " 

"I'm... not.. a fool... You.. you don't know. I could.. be a warrior..."
You lie feebly. 

"Mmhm, believe *that* when I see it," the bush shook with a rather assumptive mutter. 

"Did you fart on the way in here? Did you perhaps fart and savor a bit yourself? Stop to give the old pipes a good whiff?" 
The shrubs booming voice had taken on a bit of a pratty tone, like that boy who ratted you out in 5th grade for hiding the hamster in your backpack. Naff twat. 

You snap at the bush, "I DON'T DO WELL WITH CHEESE!" *How does he know me so well?!* you think to yourself. 

"If you're wondering how I know you so well, I dont. I heard you fart and sniff your product briefly after entering the hall. I am a talking bush, and you are my counterpart. The one who would wield me!" 
The voice of the bush was twice as long and half as calm, you can feel the energy rising in the room. 

Suddenly, a flash of light and a loud crackle split the cold, still air of the Grand Hall. 

The bush flares to life in a burst of flames and noise. 

**"NOW, COME AND BRANDISH ME. PICK ME UP AT MY BASE AND OUR WORK SHALL BEGIN."** 

Without hesitation your body responds, ignoring the warning cries from your brain. 

You grab the bush by the base of its stem and pull gently, undamaged by the healthy branches of fire and ash that lick at your skin. The parched roots that wound and dipped their way through the cobblestone below buckled at the foreign pressure and gave way, crackling and crunching like tendrils seeking prey. 

The roots of the bush wrapped themselves comfortably around your arm up to elbow, and drove their tips into the crook of your arm. You could feel the painful entry wound created by the bush only momentarily. 

A serene, matter-of-factness settled over your consciousness, like you had finally had a veil lifted from your gaze. 

You ask of the bush, somewhat dreamily, "What work?"

The bush's flames turns a deep crimson and begin to consume everything nearby. 

The last thing you hear before you lose consciousness is the bush. 

**"WHY, YOU ARE THE HERALD OF THE APOCALYPSE."**
