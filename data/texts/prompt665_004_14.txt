I wasn't aware that people had such a fascination with me, until I discovered r/gettinghisenergyback

This surprises me for a number of reasons: I've only been posting for a little over one year, I don't consider myself to be particularly fascinating in that I'm on the reserved end, yet these people seem to treat my activity like some bizarre Truman Show.

The contents of this subreddit largely seem to be mixed with NoFap, spirituality, ADHD, and a vast array of different memes, many of which appear to be poking fun at me. Other users appear to love banter and finding ways to tick each other off yet also craft long, detailed posts about their lives and what they desire to change about it.

The banner above reads: "HOME OF EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION," followed by different, randomly placed text, including "SEMEN RETENTION," "CAFFEINE" with one of those red "off limits" symbols covering it, "WIM HOF."

The top post is "u/gettingmyenergyback after two sips of coffee," showing what looks to be a man tweaking out and having an anxiety attack. The top comment reads "DERAILED AGAIN." Below that is an image post of L-Theanine, titled "Don't forget."

They appear to know precisely what's going on in my life. The newest image post, "When you drink tea while the dexedrine is still active," shows a man freaking out at his desk. One user commented "DERAILED AGAIN," and after seeing it a second time, it appears to be a running joke in that subreddit about my tendency to engage in things that I know I shouldn't, such as mixing caffeine and amphetamine medication.

All in all, it's a highly chaotic board and it intrigues me with just how accurate their assessment of me is, so I'll be keeping a close eye over the course of the next few days.
