I felt the drop of poison on my face, carving its way through my skin, my bones and my brain. 

Eternal pain. My punishment for my many crimes....

The scream died in my throat, my strengh had left me a long time ago, my name was long forgotten, my trickeries had all been exposed. But then, out of nowhere, it came. A tiny whisper carried by the cold wind that had been  battering my body for ages. "Loki". Not referring to a fictionnal character, nor coming from the lips of Odin's followers... A whisper calling for me, invoking my name as a godfather. Someone finally, although only partly, acknowledging me as a god. An anchor for me to leave this place, to leave this world. I left my old body behind, and flew through the planes of reality, rushing out of my eternal torment. 

There it was, the place where my name was spoken. I had to fly as a pigeon through the cold weather, but I felt, for the first time for ages, alive. I could see it inside : the small feeble mortal that was given to me to protect. The one feeble mortal that shall undone what Odin had done to me. For hours I watched, and finally it was alone. I land in front of the window, looking at him, waiting for this baby to just see me. Slowly he turns, and looks at the window.

The moutain of eternal pain trumbles, and a final laugh comes out of my mouth. The valkyries arrives too late, only to contemplate a cadaver, with a grin on its face.

Somewhere, in a small house, a wife asks her husband : "Honey, did the color of his eyes change ? I never noticed they were green.."

The baby laughed and Fenrir inhaled for the first time in a thousand years, blowing the snow of the Himalayas, the Midgard Serpent opened an eye and the great barrier reef shook, while the old gods looked away.

This time, Ragnarok wouldn't be stopped. 

Edit : added a clearer ending for those who aren't familiar to norse mythology :)

Edit 2 : some small grammar mistakes
