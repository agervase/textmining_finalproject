  Do we dream when we go into hibernation? 

As a depressed young man whose only hobby was sleeping, I kept asking myself this question while making my way to the hibernation pod. Everyone else had wondered, fought even, over the question if a government could force humanity to sleep. But I only hoped that Shutdown Day would allow me to dream for years. Dreams where I would live an exciting life and create my own reality. 

"Please make your way to your Hibernation Pod. The number is located on your My Government application." 

I slowly walked through what was once a shopping mall. The government had rebuilt large indoor areas such as this mall into Hibernation Pod Facilities. I hated areas such as shopping malls as they were usually crowded, noisy and dirty. In fact, almost every part of the world was full of people, and I hated that too. 

"Please make your way to your Hibernation Pod. The number is located on your My Government application." 

I started walking faster. After passing dozens of other pods, some still empty and some already taken, I eventually reached mine. It looked simple but comfortable. Would I dream in hibernation? Curiosity had been unknown to me for a while, but now it came back to me with a rush. Time to step into the pod. Time to sleep. 

Shutdown Day would begin in a couple of hours, when the whole population would be in pods. I closed my eyes and slowly dozed off.

"Good morning, Mr. Crane."

"Huh?" I murmured, as if I responded to my mother who woke me up for school.

"Thank you for participating in the Government Hibernation Programme. You can find your belongings in the locker next to your hibernation pod. The keycode is located on your My Government application."

Slowly opening my eyes, I got out of my pod. It did not feel as if I had hibernated for a hundred years. I opened my locker and looked at my belongings. Unwillingly taking my bag, not looking forward to continuing life, something odd struck me. My mobile phone was switched on. Technology had made many things possible, but these batteries only lasted for a month or so. 

*5 December 2085*, the screen noted. It was one day after I had entered my Hibernation Pod. How was this possible? 

I looked around the former shopping mall. All other pods were filled with people, but nobody was awake. I knocked on one of the pods.

"Hello? Can you hear me?" 

No response. I got nervous and looked for ways to force the pod open. It was a futile attempt. The government had designed the pods so that they would open automatically on 4 December 2185, a hundred years after Shutdown Day. They were locked electronically and operated by a central command centre somewhere in Europe. 

I ran through the facility. Nobody was awake. I went outside, only to be met with complete silence. Was I alone on this world? My car was still here. I did not know what to do but to drive home. All the traffic lights were out, because the world's electricity was shut off shortly before the shutdown except for the bit which controlled the Hibernations Pods. I turned on the radio. Nothing. 

Upon driving home, I began feeling more joyful. The truth was that I always hated this world. Not because of the people itself, but the sheer number of people. Everything had become overpopulated. My parents, who passed away long ago, told me that there once existed areas where there was nothing. Places where you could walk for hours without seeing anybody. 'Nature', they called it. They said that nature turned into villages, villages became suburbs, and suburbs became cities. I had only known cities. Now I was alone in the world. A world of cities without people living in them.

Suddenly, I heard the radio cracking. I turned the volume a little higher.

"Krrrrr....... He......"

Was I hearing voices? 

"Ca...... ear.... e?"

I turned the volume even higher.

"Hey, can you hear me?" a voice from the radio said.

"Ye... yes" I responded, shocked for a while and not knowing what was going on.

"Yes, I can hear you", I said slightly louder. 

"You did not think you were the only one awake, did you?" The voice said plainly.

I did not know how to respond.

"Instruct your car to drive to the location that appears on your phone. I will explain the rest later. Do not speak to anyone else on your way here", the voice said.

Still confused, I typed in the address on my car's navigation interface.

*Humanity First Office - DRIVE HERE?* 

Humanity First. I remembered the group from the news. They had kidnapped and murdered politicians who supported the hibernation programme. Why was a strange voice leading me to the headquarters of a radical group? And why did I not go into hibernation? There was only one way to find out. 

"OK", I said, confirming the location.
