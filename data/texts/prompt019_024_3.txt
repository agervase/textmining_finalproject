I couldn’t believe it at first. I mean, I guess that’s what anybody would say if the just discovered they were the world’s most powerful super villain .  I know right? A freaking super villain!  
It started while doing research for a school project.  Just me, going to the library, ditching the shelves of carefully written and fact checked books for the lawless internet of un checked information, when I came across a website.  Forgottenvillansofseattle.com 
(Don’t ask how my research led me there)
I was amused at first, obviously it was a joke.  Then I saw a picture of myself.  Had I discovered my doppelgänger?  My interest piqued. I started reading.  Apparently I had once been the most powerful villain in Seattle, with the power to convince people of things using only my words.
Oh, and I could move objects using my mind.  Basically I was a Jedi. An evil Jedi.  So a sith I guess?
Anyway, about 3 years ago I had risen to power to the amazement of many in my small city outside Seattle.  A nine year old accomplishing amazing things.
I wanted control, and fish.  So I set my sights to Seattle, the jewel of the Pacific Northwest (screw you Portland).
 But Seattle was protected.  Erica wentz put a stop to me. 
Our local superhero.  She’s great.  Well, I used to think she was... now I’m not so sure.
I had power, prestige and at age 9!
Now I’m a socially awkward, anxious 13 going on 14 year old who can hardly talk to a crowd, let alone control a city.

That’s part of the reason I wrote this.  To see if my powers are still there.  To see if reading my words is enough to convince you of what I once was.  
Maybe it’s time for Eileen vs Erica vol. 2. 
Watch out Seattle.  
Your favorite evil Jedi is back.
