Karl sighed. It had been six days since his last break, the excavator pod was beginning to smell a bit ripe, and now the laser array was flashing "Out of Alignment" warnings all throughout the cabin. Leaning back in his chair, Karl ran a frustrated hand through his hair. He'd have to get out of the pod to fix the damn thing, *again.* Grabbing one more bite of his protein bar, Karl begrudgingly hauled himself out of the chair and down towards the access hatch.

The EVA suit was such a pain; to make it safe for a single person to put on safely, it was a maze of redundant checks and failsafes. Beginning the forty-five minute process, Karl grumbled to nobody as he struggled to put the oversized pants on. When he had been headhunted for the Nova Mars Project, he'd assumed that his geology expertise would have ensured him a cushy job in Logistics or Mineral Analysis. This "hands-on" garbage was beneath him, and Karl had just about had it.

But what other option was there? Technically, Karl could quit and go back to Earth on the next shuttle. He wouldn't be the first, and certainly wouldn't be the last. But what would be the point? Holding the EVA helmet in his hands, Karl wondered if they'd let him take one of these suits home. You needed something almost as protective just to go outside these days, especially for an profession like Karl's. And it's not like anyone was digging up any new &amp; interesting core samples... any nonessential industrial equipment had been deemed "Illegal to Activate" by the Beijing Accords, to minimize pollutant growth. Unfortunately, there was no real future left on Earth. And so Karl stayed, choking continuously on his pride.

After enduring the constant needling and nagging of the onboard computer for twice as long as his patience allowed for, Karl slowly waddled out of the pod's airlock. Slowly moving to the front of the pod, he swore loudly to himself at what he saw. Technically, yes, the laser array *would* be considered out of alignment if it was *completely fucking missing.* Karl banged his helmet against the pod, despair welling up inside him. He was too deep beneath the bedrock for communications to function, and there was no way he'd be able to make it back to the surface without the tunnelling laser. Karl's only hope was to manually scour the surrounding area and pray that he could find the damn array before he ran out of supplies.

**Day 4**

Karl pulled off his remaining boot, flopping back onto the floor. Another wasted day, with nothing to show for it. How could the array be so hard to find? It couldn't have fallen off long ago, and the damn thing was two feet wide! He'd expected to find it tucked under the pod, but it was becoming increasingly possible that the array was somehow completely gone. It was becoming harder and harder to justify the effort of cramming himself into that smelly EVA suit, just to wander around uselessly in the dark for hours.

Rolling onto his side, Karl reached over to the discarded torso of the EVA suit, pulling rocks out of the storage pouches. If he was going to be going on so many of these stupid "field trips", Karl wanted there to be *some* purpose. He'd begun to gather samples of the surrounding rock, samples the likes of which he'd never seen before: never on Earth had anyone dug this deeply, because the technology to do so hadn't existed until nobody had the reason to.

Karl meandered over to the sample lab, an addition to his pod that he'd had to finance personally. Technically, his job was just to dig out heat vents; there was no sample collection on his agenda. But since he may die down here, Karl at least wanted to leave behind some potentially useful data for whoever came to find his body... or salvage the pod. Whatever.

Nibbling on a corner of a protein bar, Karl ran his latest rocks through the analyzer. He'd been doing a pretty good job stretching out his food supplies; their heinous flavour was finally a positive trait. He estimated he had a good three weeks before running out of food, more than enough time to look around for a while before finally finding that damned array and heading back up to a communication-friendly depth.

A soft beep; the analysis was complete. Grabbing a cup of water from the reclaimator, Karl sat down with his ounce of dinner to look over the results. Sipping carefully, a single eyebrow began to arch on his brow. "That's... strange." Karl hadn't spoken a word aloud to anyone for weeks, and the sound of his own voice almost distracted him from the screen. But amidst spectrograph charts and radion decay estimates, Karl saw the beginning of a story he hadn't expected.

Perhaps the array could wait a few more days.

**Day 18**

The pod was half filled with rocks, the other half filled with exposed cords. Karl had slaved the pod's processor to the tiny one installed in his sample lab; technically a breach of operating protocol, but he was far beyond that now. The only reason Karl donned the EVA suit now was to retrieve more samples; he hadn't even thought of the array in weeks. The cockpit screens no longer showed operation meters and warnings, but instead various sections of the full Mars terraforming plan and comparative analyses of Earth.

Karl had slept in the cockpit chair again last night, and had forgotten to eat; that's one more day the supplies might stretch to, so Karl didn't really mind the faint haze that had grown over his vision. Waking blearily, Karl's first action was to swing the nearest screen back into the centre of his slowly failing vision. The more he looked, the more it all seemed to come together. If Karl was right (and it was looking like he might be), this would justify everything about this entire shit assignment on this ball of dead rock.

"Need... more samples." It seemed to take more and more effort to peel himself out of that chair day by day, but Karl paid it no mind. Just another form of equipment failure, and he couldn't let it stop him. Not when there was another issue at hand: the samples that Karl needed? He couldn't get them at this depth. He'd need to go *deeper.*

Karl may not have been actively looking for the array in the past few weeks, but he was sure he'd have seen it if it was anywhere near the pod. How he'd lost it so completely was beyond him, but that hardly mattered now. What mattered was drilling deeper, somehow, *without* the array.

And what was the array, really? It focused energy, sure, but it didn't *supply* the energy. Technically, the pod could still fire the beam... it would just diffract wildly, likely damaging the pod and *certainly* blowing out the emitter. But so what? It was already looking like Karl would die down here, and a single burst wasn't going to get him anywhere near the surface. But there *was* a hollow void beneath this chamber: a solid explosion would blow out the bottom and send the pod into freefall. But of all the stupid things to do to the pod, freefall was one of the things it was specifically designed to withstand; to accelerate the drilling process, pods were dropped from orbit to spike them as deep into Mars' crust as possible. It wouldn't be the most comfortable ride, but it would get Karl where he needed to be.

And so, Karl began to slowly slap the EVA suit together. The process was quicker, now that he'd overridden most of the safeguards. Given all the other lethally dangerous things he'd been doing, disabling that nagging computer voice demanding he double check his seals was the smartest move he'd made.

Today, he'd rig up the exposed emitter to fire one last time. By this time tomorrow, Karl would have the last samples he needed.

**Day 19**

Karl had unknowing damaged the pod's inertial compensators when he tinkered around hooking up his sample lab, meaning the pod was no more capable of freefalling than any other giant hunk of metal. Karl screamed for three minutes as the pod bounced down the shaft, until the shriek of metal crashing into stone drowned him out. Darkness.

**Day 23**

Karl awoke, only to find himself still strapped to the cockpit chair. Said chair *was* on the other side of the pod from the cockpit, but given the impacted state of the former cockpit it seemed to be a bit of blessing. Karl didn't feel blessed, though: he could feel multiple fractures and bruises all over. Going into freefall in a pod filled with loose rocks may have been the stupidest decision of Karl's life, and his shattered leg was testament to that; one of his samples had crushed his knee at some point. Gritting his teeth, Karl unbuckled the chair. It dumped him unceremoniously to the ground, flashing his entire body with the most incredible pain. Darkness.

**Day 24**

Blinking awake, Karl vaguely wondered how long he'd been out. Surely no more than a few minutes since the fall, though his stomach said otherwise. Crawling slowly and painfully to the small storage bunker, Karl had never been so happy to see the remaining protein bars and emergency water. Rationing made little sense at this point, so he ate his fill. Despite the pain coursing through him, eating helped Karl felt sharper than he had in long time... sharp enough to curse himself for this short-sighted plan. The damage to the pod was so extreme, it was a miracle he still had atmosphere. What would be the chances that he could still analyze samples?

Taking inventory was a slow and unpleasant process,  but it was more positive than expected. The pod's processor was shot, but the sample lab's portable computer still operated, as did the hand scanner. A few auxiliary systems still worked... including communications of all things, but more importantly life support. The power cells were damaged, but not ruptured. If Karl could drag himself into the EVA suit one last time, he could still get his last sample. This hadn't been for nothing.

Lying awkwardly on the flooring, Karl closed his eyes. He knew he didn't have much more left in him, but he only needed one more day.
