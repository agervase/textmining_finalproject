"So... uh. What now?"

The reaper fumed.

"Do I... Do I go now? Or?" I trailed off as his fury seemed to rise ever further. 

"This is not how the game works!" he shouted angrily.

I flinched away, "Sorry."

"Don't be sorry! Stop cheating!"

"I'm sorry," I repeated again. "It's not my fault, it's the only strategy I know."

"I can't let you off the hook AGAIN! MY SUPERIORS ARE BREATHING DOWN MY NECK, AND THIS IS THE FIFTH FUCKING TIME!" he screamed. "YOU CAN'T KEEP USING THIS FOUR MOVE BULLSHIT EVERY TIME YOU'RE DUMB ENOUGH TO DIE! EVEN THE CHESS GRAND MASTERS AREN'T FOOLISH ENOUGH TO USE THAT STRATEGY!"

I kept trying to lean farther away, because he kept getting louder and louder.

After a few minutes of huffing and puffing, he finally seemed to calm down enough for me to ask the question.

"So... Do I get the key?"

He gave me a dirty look, as much of a dirty look as skull can give, I suppose. Slowly, he reached into his dangling black cloak, and pulled forth a small golden key. The bones of his hand grasped it so hard I was worried his fingers might crack. He shoved his hand out. I gingerly took the key, stood, and walked over to the door.

His voice stopped me from inserting the key, "Listen here, you little shit. If you die from something stupid again, I am going to be pissed. You're only eighteen, and it keeps getting harder and harder to come up with a believable way to save you life. Next time, I'm going to find a way to make sure you stay dead, regardless of what the rules say."

I paused. "I promise, you won't see me for a very long time, Mr. Reaper. See you later!" I jammed the key into the keyhole and turned the lock, vanishing back to my life.

*One week later*

"So... Do I get the key?"
