"What are you going on about?" I exclaim while being cornered into the ally next to me.

Hearing that wasn't quite how you'd expect your day to start. But he was right I did.

&#x200B;

"What Robert, do I need to remind you?" He sneered.

He didn't. I'd given him the scar. Which was from a musket I fired point blank into him after stabbing him.

&#x200B;

"Now let's not get hostile here I'm just trying to get to work. You must have the wrong person."

&#x200B;

"No, you're definitely the guy. I'd know that face after what you did to me." He pulls up his shirt to show the wound. While also unholstering a small pistol.

&#x200B;

The wound itself indented in two areas. One a more triangular tear though I'd screwed up stabbing him and it lurched up a bit making it sowable. In the other a spoons scoop out of him right on top of it. All the while with the protrusions of where stitches were and the veins now bulbous from needing to form differently from such an egregious wound.

&#x200B;

While he's distracted by the whole ordeal I slam him with my knee right up into the wound. Causing him to double over and drop the gun.

&#x200B;

After which dash out of the alley and down the street. Not before I hear a scraping of metal and a staggered step.

My ears ring from the shots but they miss their mark luckily. Now sprinting for my life I head across the street only to here honking and my body being thrown onto the pavement. I get behind the car while he gets out.

Another shot rings out and I hear a body hit the hood and slap the pavement.

&#x200B;

"Robert! I've got more lead for you! Come on don't make this harder than...

A siren rings out, and a voice is heard on a loudspeaker.
