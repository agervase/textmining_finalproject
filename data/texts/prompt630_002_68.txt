Sorry for format on phone

"Next." I call out into the tube on my desk."Roger that,we'll have one coming down in just a second,the extraction team just got back.These ones are fresh as a flower".

Their always delayed,not that I'm complaining.It gives me some time to prepare for the next one."Ok ones coming your way now" a voice from the tube echoes.Ahead of me,2 shiny chrome doors open with a hiss of smoke,revealing "it".A zombie in other terms.

The stench hits me first.Rotting cabbage and sewer water.Not the worst I've experienced but not the best either."It" slowly shuffles out,flesh falling of the bones,muscles exposed,eyes staring ahead, unresponsive.Putting on the mouth guard,I stroll over and sink my teeth it's arm.Its mushy and soft,like a squished banana.
I quickly stop biting "It" and dispose of the mouth guard lest I catch anything.I quickly turn my eyes back to "It".The transformation's always a pleasure to watch.

At first there's nothing.Then a small patch of rotting flesh falls of,revealing pinkish skin below.Soon,more and more patches start falling off.Mere minutes later, all of the rotting flesh on the body has fallen off,revealing a human below.Its a middle aged female,approximately 30 to 40 years old."Where am I?What is this place?Who are yo-".She stops,tears welling in her eyes.
She's started the flashforward.

See,when a human is turned into a zombie,the only lose control of their motor functions and their consciousmind.But not their subconscious.That remembers everything.All the killing and eating of other humans.The faces of their loved ones as she butchered them.The taste of human flesh.All these memories are stored in their subconscious and the moment she's turned back into a human, these memories come flooding back.All at once.

Slowly,I drag her towards a lift in my office.She's in shock,jaw slack,barely resisting.Setting her down onto the floor of the elevator,I send her to processing before I go back  and acknowledge the successful transformation to my superiors and repeat the process.
