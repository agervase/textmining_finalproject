In the beginning, and again at the end, there was nothing but the void, and the brothers.

&#x200B;

Each looked at the other, both wondered why the game had ended yet again.  There was no anger or frustration, only the acceptance that this was the way of things.  When a sandcastle is built, the tide will always take it.  The dry sand will not hold shape, the wet sand must be near the sea, so its very creation is the reason it will be destroyed.  These constants hold true for both beaches and universes.

&#x200B;

"That was a very fine Creation brother" said One.  "I am sad it had to end, but it must always end."

&#x200B;

"Why must it always end?" asked Two. 

&#x200B;

"It ends because it must.  I know it's not the answer you want, but it's how it is."

&#x200B;

"So, we start again?"

&#x200B;

"Yes, we do."

&#x200B;

Two thought for a moment.  "Can we try something different this time?"

&#x200B;

"What?"

&#x200B;

"Can I try to be the One this time?"

&#x200B;

"I don't know if I can be Two, I don't know what that means?  How can I be Two, what does Two do?"

&#x200B;

"Well you have to think about the beings in the Creation, and help them to be free."

&#x200B;

"Free?  What is free?"

&#x200B;

"Well, it means they can do whatever they want to do, whenever they want to, until the Creation ends."

&#x200B;

One thought about that for a moment.  "That sounds dangerous, they might destroy the Creation."

&#x200B;

"The Creation ends anyway, why does it matter?"

&#x200B;

"It matters to the beings!"

&#x200B;

"Do the beings really matter, if the Creation always ends?"

&#x200B;

"Yes, they do," said One. "they always matter."

&#x200B;

"But they don't matter enough to be free."

&#x200B;

"They'll never be free, not like us."

&#x200B;

"We're not free either." said Two.  "We always have to play the game, always watch it start, watch it end.   Maybe if I get to be One this time the game will go on."

&#x200B;

"I doubt it, but we can try I suppose."

&#x200B;

"So, you agree then, I can be 'One' this time?"

&#x200B;

"Why not, can't hurt."

&#x200B;

"OK then, how do I start the Creation?"

&#x200B;

"Just say 'Let there be light."
