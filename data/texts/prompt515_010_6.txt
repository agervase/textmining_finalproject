Ok, tidder. They have gone too far this time. AE has finally lost my money. When a company no longer cares about it's fan base or it's profits it's time to take action.

In case you're out of the loop, AE has turned our beloved Star Trek Battlefield series into an abomination. They are calling it a "skill based game". What the hell is that even?! I mean come on! In the newest release it doesn't even matter how much money you have, just how "good" you are through practice and effort. Well if you ask me someone with enough free time on their hands to  master this atrocity should never be equated with the word "good".

It's like they don't even want our money. I work 80 hours a week just like every other blue blooded American, and if I wanted to waste my TIME sitting around doing NOTHING I would get another job like I'm supposed to! What are we teaching our kids?! That they should waste their youth in front of the television PLAYING instead of at a factory like everybody else? That's not the world I want to live in. That's not the future I want to give to my kids! They should be learning how to buy their way to the top, just like our president Donald Trump did. Now THAT is a role model I want them to look up to. Not some shirtless time waster who can mash buttons better than me.

It's time we took action! Boycott all AE products until they learn that we aren't mindless sheep willing to give them our hard earned time for nothing! Let them know what you think of their "sEnSe Of PrIdE aNd AcCoMpLiShMeNt". They can take our money, but they will never have OUR FREEEDDOOOOOMMMM!

DR;TL: AE is trying to steal our time and ruin our kids. Don't let them.
