There's something about a fern in the morning rain. They're old plants. Hundreds of millions of years old. I've seen a score of things I detest, a plethora of nasty, unconscionable images. There's nothing that evokes an opposite image of the brutality of the world more readily than a fern in the morning rain, for me, at least.  This one I'd seen a dozen or so times. It was on the walk to the river, where I got water. Where I did my job. Where, for the first time since everything happened, the world felt right and real and I had some hope.

I didn't have hope now. If you cut the legs off a zombie put a fucking stick in the ground and mark it, so some asshole looking for water doesn't get bit. 

A disgusting waste of my life.

It would probably be better to deal with it sooner, rather than later. There had been hope when you'd gotten back. People had mentioned things, said words, like cure, vaccine.

Hope.

For those who hadn't been bitten. 

The morning rain had collected upon one of the leaves and was weighing the fern down insistently. That's what he felt like.

Insistently weighed down.

There was no particular love held for the gun in his pocket, and as he leveled it, it almost seemed incorrect that his last act was basically making out with a cold steel arbiter of poor decisions. 

Iron tastes funny.

He retracted the weapon. A groan in the woods. Past the fern, movement. As the light revealed to him some purpose, he thought to himself, maybe I won't end me. Maybe I'll prevent someone from having my future.

Maybe I'll go kill that zombie over there, before I kill myself.

As he passed the fern, he let his hand brush it. The water, insistent, that had gathered on the leaf, rushed towards the ground, its surface tension broken.

Edit: The only WP I've ever felt compelled to answer. I want to answer most but don't believe in my own ability to properly catch the situation. This one felt right.
