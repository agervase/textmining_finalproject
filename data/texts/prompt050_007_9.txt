You've heard somewhere tha' war is hell, have yeh? Well, there ain't no hell even a *mite* closer to finding out you've survived one on the losing side... Aye, you'd rather endure a thousand hells before waking up under an oppressive, open sky.

Oh, we had warning alright. Not a soul passes above or below The Prominence without our knowin'. Yet we laughed, we drank, we buggered, and we laughed some more. It had been near o'er a thousand generations since we'd been at war, and we went on happily forgotten by the surface-dwelling fools who slake their thirst on upon the blood of decimated species weaker than them.

But we are Dwarves! Civilized, cultured, and long-lived! We have nary a care in the world so long as we leave the surface-wilds to it's primitive savages. The same savages that thought their sticks and leathers were brilliant inventions, and tools of power. The same savages who delight and die under the unrelenting gaze of Sul above them.

The same savages that opened our mountain, and allowed the Eye of Sul to see our home for the first time in all its history.

The Kingdom of Man came. 

They were different, in a fashion. Their lust for destruction still present, but more dangerous than we'd ever dreamed. They wore strange finery, and held even stranger devices. They brought forth their massive engines and iron claws attached. They brought their giant metal beasts that roared louder than ten Tir-Tolan Deepstalkers and rode them from the inside, soaring 'round and 'round.

The savages drilled straight into The Pillar of Strength, and in the blink of an eye, Ãœmsterholm had collapsed under its own weight.

We were at war for less than one hundred steady breaths before it was over. Somehow, I survived.

Somehow, I *remembered.*

Edit: Never tried one of these before. Sorry if it's shit:x
