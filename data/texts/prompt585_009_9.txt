*''Can you see anything?''*

''Alright guys, this is the last thing we heard since the radio silence. We know that they reported it was out there so it should be some technical issue that will resolve in a few hours or so...''

**3 hours later** 

''They have more than enough backup battaries it doesn’t make sense. Do you have any idea, Junior?''

''No, sir. I think we have no better option other than wait and see.''


''We just got this. It came from Henry’s radio. His voice wasn’t clear for a second then we heard a high pitch sound after that everythin he said was crystal clear quality.''

''Planet is inhabited?’ What the hell? We have to do something. This can’t be real. Activate the emergency E55’s''

''But sir, they are not designed for surface mision. They are meant for orbital rescue.''

''We are not gonna use E55’s. They carry DARPA’s new units. They can do the surface mission.''

''I wasn’t aware of that. So did China actually went with a deal?''

''I don’t give a single fuck about  China. If these guys under a threat by another species that means we have a bigger problems than China. Just do what I just said.''

''Alright, sir.''

**15 minutes since the surface search robots landed.**

''Image is clear. We can see the ship.''

''Send two of them and send other one to gather information about the surroundings.''

‘Yes, sir. sending them right now.''

''What is that?''

''It loosk like a some sort of sharp object sticked to the ship.''

''Can we get a closer look?''

''It’s emitting some sort of...''

''Did we just lose the visiual?''

''I’m trying to get it back, sir.''

''We have a visiual on the recon mission robot.''

''Hold his position. Can you read any kind of signal from the surface?''

''Nothing that matters.''

''What you mean, Junior?''

''Isn’t it obvious? Just look at the screen don’t you see the beauty?''

''Alright, you need take a break...''

''Ah. You are in denial. You can’t stop the time, therefore you can’t stop us.''


**45 minutes since the surface search robots landed**


''Hey? It’s me Henry. Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me? There is two robots right next to ship they look like shit. Like something stomped them. Hey? ANYBODY?''
