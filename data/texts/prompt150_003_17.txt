“Hey guys this is my friend Nicholas from Poly-Sci, he is going to join us today ” - *Kaski says while motioning for Nicholas to sit at a large wooden table* 



“Oh of course, we are going to need more bright minds to pull this off, I’m Diego by the way” *Diego backed up a bit leaving enough room for Nicholas to squeeze into a chair* 




Kaski: *looking at Nicholas* “Okay let me introduce you to everyone.” *points to a short dark skinned Hispanic fellow wearing a Astros baseball cap* “this right here is Pedro” 




Pedro: “Hola, I’m Diego’s brother”





Kaski: *pointing at a short asian girl* “That’s Kani, she’s an exchange student from Myanmar”



*Kani smiles and slightly waves towards Nicholas* 



Kaski: *leaning back whispering to Nicholas* “she can understand English perfectly she just has a hard time speaking it so she doesn’t talk much” 




Kaski: *pointing to a ginger wearing a derby hat* “This is Carter, he’s Irish...... I think?” 



Carter: *visibly furious* “I’m Welsh you back handed cuntish asshat” 




Kaski: *Turning his attention towards Carter* “Eh I’m not going to pretend like I can tell the difference” 




Kaski: *points to a dark skinned girl in a hoodie near the back of the table but before he can introduce her a large voice is heard from the top of a staircase* 



“HEY KASKI I GOT THE SUPPLIES YOU WANTED WHERE SH....... oh hey who’s the new guy?” *a energetic suited man says while placing a heavy wooden box on the ground* 



Kaski: “Oh that’s Nicholas, I met him in Poly-Sci.... really knows his stuff. I figured he could help with our little project” *Kaski looks back at Nicholas* “oh and Nicholas this is Ben,” 




Diego: “well now that everyone is here we can get started” *Diego draws attention to several large continental maps before focusing on a extremely detailed Map of Libya* 




Pedro: *mildly surprised* “Bro, we’re still going with Libya?”



Carter: *heavy Irish accent* “ye remember we ruled out Honduras last meeting due to the recent media presence and we sure as shit can’t try Albania again” Carter looked around the table as everyone but Nicholas nodded in agreement. 



Kaski: “okay so Libya it is” *Kaski looked closely at the enlarged Libyan map before noticing Nicholas’s warranted confusion* 




Kaski: “Oh my apologies, see Nicholas what we do is we pick countries with um let’s just say a certain type of.............” *Kaski is interrupted by Carter* 




“corrupt war torn poverty-stricken shitholes” Carter shouts out to the dismay of the table. 




Kaski: “in a sense yes..... then we attempt to build them up and expand them” 




Nicholas: “Oh I see so like Risk? Or any Paradox game?” 




Kaski: “yes exactly” 



Pedro: *looking at Nicholas* “But we have a problem with Libya, we can fix the economy by lifting sanctions, purge the jihadist with the help of warlords, even stable the country to an extant but we can’t find a way to beat Egypt in a conventional war. Not to mention raising a army in Libya is difficult due to the civil war..... no one wants to fight anymore.” 




Nicholas: “So we can stabilize Libya but we’re stuck after that?” 





Diego: “essentially yes, we need resources from Egypt to really expand but they outnumber, outgun and are just overall more prepared for any future war against Libya, Sisi has the military on high alert.” 





Nicholas: “okay I think I get it now, but tell me.... why do we need Egypt?” 




Diego: *looking back at Nicholas with mild confusion* “I’m sorry what do you mean?”




Nicholas: “Well Libya borders other countries as well, countries a little less stable......tell me what is the national military of Libya armed with?” 




Pedro: “some old Soviet tanks, a few flying rusty Russian gunships, and a abundance of AKs. All in all not a lot, definitely not enough to invade Egypt” 




Nicholas: “Right, not enough to invade Egypt.......... but perhaps enough to win a border scrimmage with Chad. All their military supplies are remnants left from the French in the 50s. Even our Military could win a few conventional battles at the border. Plus Chad is more obscure, no one will notice if we go to war against Chad, but if we take in Egypt a coalition with the Arab would could form against us” 




*The entire table looked at Nicholas astonished* 




Kaski: “He has a point, start a war in Chad, win boost popularity and the media avoids it because it’s Africa. But Egypt might not..... if they mobilize while we’re in Chad that could be a issue” 




Pedro: “No we could that, Like Nicholas said if Egypt is involved the world might take notice, so if Egypt is seen as an aggressor it will benefit us.” 




Diego: okay here’s the plan, we take over Libya like originally planned, but we take on Chad first. The Egyptians will mobilize and we will let them think we’re loosing in Chad. Sisi will take this ‘opportunity’ to rally his country against the new Libyan state. We can appeal to the international community and when Egypt is isolated we make peace with Chad and rearm their outdated military to help us fight against Sisi.”





Kaski: *places Ben’s large wooden box on the table* “ladies and gentlemen, tonight we will be entering Libya disguised as their new revolutionary leadership.”




Nicholas: *visually confused* “Wait What?”




*Kaski opens the box and starts handing out handguns and fake passports* 




Nicholas: “Holy shit guys” 




*a large crack is heard up stairs followed by loud ringing explosion* 



Pedro: *points his gun towards the door* “ITS THE POLICE” 



*the black girl from the back table pulls her hoodie off to reveal a bullet from vest* 




Diego: *Looks back at the black girl* “wait you’re not Amita” *aims gun at her*



“CIA, You’re all under arrest for the shit you pulled in Albania” *The girl said while showing her badge and pointing a revolver at Diego* 



Carter: *heavy Irish accent* “Wow wow wow, let’s just calm down”




*Kani jumped at the CIA women with a knife catching her off guard, she gets a shot off hitting Kani in the chest as she falls to the the floor* 



Within seconds both Kani and the CIA informant are dead. 




Kaski: *visibly furious* “WE NEED TO GO NOW” *opens up a back door that leads into a underground cavern* 






Everyone begins rushing through as bullets ricochet around the room they were just in


“THESE ARE WAR CRIMINALS IN OVER 80 COUNTRIES, DON’T TAKE ANY OF THEM ALIVE” a voice is heard as SWAT breaks down the door and floods the room the gang just escaped from. 





Carter: *stops and pulls out pistol and locks the door behind him separating himself from Kaski, Diego, Pedro, Ben, and a very scared Nicholas* 



Kaski: “What are you doing?”




Carter: *talking trough a locked door* “someone has to stay and cover the escape, you......get these men to Libya. No time to argue”


Carter: *drawing his gun and turning away from the door* 



*Everyone continues to run through the caves hearing gun shots from behind. 



*Nicholas is presumably killed by a stray bullet fired from Carters last stand against the Police.* 


Kaski: *looking back at Nicholas* “NO, WE LOST NICHOLAS” 




Diego: *jumping past his body* “we can weep for the dead later but now WE NEED TO GO”



*the remaining gang members escape* 




[13 hours later]
*Nicholas wakes up on a hospital bed surrounded by FBI and CIA* 

“Oh good it was just a through and through, get some rest you’re going to Libya in the morning” a large suited gentlemen states. 




Nicholas: “please I don’t know those guys” 



CIA guy: “then you could have no problem killing them for us”
