I was sore from the probing, my mind weak from endless hours of testing, but nothing could have prepared me for the company of Jack Black. Trapped together in a bright white cell, his presence onboard the alien spacecraft was more torture than I could ever have previously imagined. Worse still, there was no reason for his existence, except seemingly to torture me further. He sat slumped in a chair, leering at me through greasy black locks, smirking while I desperately felt the walls for fractures. His faded plaid shirt left open, revealing a tired, hair-covered gut which was peppered with crumbs. Now and then, I would flinch in pain from where the aliens had examined me, and he would snort and cough on leftover, half-chewed crisps. I wished he would choke to death. 

A hole suddenly opened in the wall and one of them glided in. Jack suddenly sat bolt upright, like an obedient mutt, eyes steadily following the alien as it made its way towards him. It was then that I knew. A deafening sound screeched and I clasped my hands over my ears, watching through tear-filled eyes as Jack Black's skin retreated from his skull down to his feet, revealing a hideous creature so repulsive that I began to vomit. He was one of them. The alien slowly crept onto him, merging their bodies into one. I knew that I had to kill it, even if it meant killing myself in the process. I leapt at the beast, digging my nails into what I thought were eye sockets, and did my best to drill my hands into its brain. Suddenly I felt as though I was being sucked in. My hands fell forward and I grasped at nothingness until I could see nothing but darkness. It had consumed me.
