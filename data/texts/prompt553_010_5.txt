I usually write poetry, not stories, so sorry if my wording seems odd.



I remember it clearly. The last time I kissed your lips, and you kissed me back. A warm summer evening, just like your blush, your smile, your hand.

And your blood.

My heart had been mutilated. The last time I saw life in your eyes, because the pictures feel distant and the gleam going, now gone.

I miss you.

Even though you lie in my arms each night, it feels like a lie to not have you here with me, whispering sweet truths into my ear until I fall asleep. Our daughter cries for you. Does she know my pain, my loss of reason and  common sense? In her heart does she too feel your absence?

It hurt so much.

That pain. That agonizing pain I lived through just to die. All to save you. She didn't cry for me that night. She screamed. But I would do it so you could see her too.

So I do.

You saved me back, and I wrote angry letters to you the first few nights at a feverish pace. I just couldn't accept that you'd take your life again, to save someone as lifeless as me. She needs you more than I do.

But you did.

I woke up again, this to a reply. A request for repetition. Even in death, your puppy dog eyes compelled me to do it again. And again. And again.

It got easier.

We kept going. We found a way around it, began writing to letters to each other in a notebook, decorated with stickers our daughter picked out. She said she loves dark blue butterflies, did you know? I don't know what she'll say when she gets older, when she find out that we will never get to watch a movie as a family, she will only have her mother to see her at graduation, her father to walk her down the aisle. But we'll figure that out one day, because not even death will do us part.

I love you.
