*knock* *knock* *knock* 

- did you hear that?

*knock* *knock* *knock* 

- there it is again. There's someone outside what should we do. 

+ woof woof woof 

- ok calm down girl don't say anything. 

*knock* *knock* *knock* 

- *shit* who is it? who's out there? 

# I bring presents and food and medicine for all of you in there, I brought a little doll for Lauren, and a firetruck for Kevin, and a brand new tennis ball for cinnamon, please open up it's freezing and there is no longer any fireplace were I can come in. 

-who are you? What do want we have nothing here. We are almost starved and had no power we have nothing please just go and don't hurt us. 

# I do not wish to harm you in any way, you have no power I can fix that. There the lights should be on now. 

- yes they turned on thank you how did you that? 

# Can you just open I don't want to ruin the surprise for the kids. 

- the kids are sleeping so is my wife I have to keep watch tonight. 

# Yes I know, I also know they are wearing earplugs, things have gone really crazy around here haven't they. 

- Yes they have, I haven't been outside in about a week and half there were people killing and eating each other, I just wanted to go check the traps and pick up something so we can eat but I am to afraid to go out now I been listening and they are getting closer to find us and I don't know what they will do to us when they do I'm sca.... 

# Worry not anymore for I have came to you and finally brought peace and love this piece of land. You don't have to open you can probably watch me on the cameras by now the system should be fully working. 

- I'll go check. 

# So who is outside Bryan? 

- I see someone dressed like Santa. 

# well I am Santa here to my right is my sack full of presents, to my back the bright red light is Rudolphs nose. So please open up I am on schedule you know I have a couple more minutes to spare there's not that much people left on earth and the little left are not all good but still I have a lot to do tonight. 

- I will open I will trust and if you're planning on doing something horrible to us just please don't make the children suffer, I..... I........ I do prefer them to go quickly and not to starve and die a slow and painful death. 

*Clank* *Clank* 

# Put down the shotgun Bryan I am not coming in until you do please just put it down. 

- How did you know? 

# Iknow when you are sleeping I know when you are awake I just know. I also know you are in my naughty list Bryan but all in all you have been a good husband and good father or the best you can be on times like this. 

I took courage and put down the shotgun the door opened slowly he entered first dragging the bag behind him he sat infront of me looked me in the eye and told me. 

# You cannot keep lying to them outside is safe now all the bad people are gone, I took care of everything the only bad person left is you I know you did it all to protect your family but still. 

- I was just trying to provide for my family, the first time was really hard and I almost didn't do it but I don't regret and has become easier with time but I will carry it forever with me they will never know what I did for them I was just...... 


# I know that's why I didn't force myself in as I said it is bad, but not as bad as what has been going on around here. People eating and killing and raping each other these are sick times but you have managed to keep your family together and have been able to keep your little ones safe and innocent, have managed to keep them out of what you have seen on the outside. So here it is a firetruck, the doll some candy for them, here's the food and medicine I promised and this should last them until I come back next year they will forever remember you as a loving and caring father and husband but I cannot allow you to stay with them......... So you will come outside with me and deal with the consequences of your actions. 

- Who's going to care for them and protect them if I leave, I am the on....... 

# They will manage and I already took care of all the bad people they will be fine and will come next year and make sure they stay fine. 

- Ok I will go but can I leave a card or something so they know I am no abandoning them? 

# It's already there I already leave everything you wanted to say in letters to be opened in their time. 

- So we're are we going? 

# Bryan you are going to die I will kill you and take care of your body. As I did with all the craziness going around here and believe this is not the worst happening around the world but you are going to be the hardest. I want you admit to what you did and that will make it easier. 

- I have killed a lot of people and stole their food and clothes and tried my best to do it in the less painful way possible I have only killed the bad people and never someone innocent. 

# Killing is killing no matter how you rationalize it. See it was easy if you admit it first, so let's go it is time. 

As soon as I walked out I saw the reindeer the gigantic chariot they are tied too and it was full of dead bodies. 

# yours will be painless I promise just like going to sleep. 

- when is it going to happ......
