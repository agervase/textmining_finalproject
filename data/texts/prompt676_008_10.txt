I looked out my window, and suddenly the row of house across from me were gone, erased from existence. Sweat dripped from my forehead and I wiped it away with a trembling hand. I suddenly became very aware of my accelerating heart beat.

Was it a hallucination? If so, there's no harm in it.

Skyscrapers simply ceased to exist. I knew not what the bystanders witnessed, how they reacted, but I could only imagine. But the view of the mountains was back, and suddenly the city felt a lot more peaceful.

It was as if a ray had opened up and created a void directly behind my monitor, a square rectangle void where the trees were. There was a strange sound to it, like a loud clap, as the air rushed in to fill the new vacuum of nothingness.

I look into the hole directly and lined up my vision with its path. It cut through the mountains and I could see sky through them. It seemed to be a perfect rectangle chopping through them.

How much wildlife did I just end? Was there a mountain lion at the edge of the rectangle, suddenly chopped in half? What sort of destruction had I wrought? My neighbors across the street were surely gone. It was a strange feeling, an ecstasy of power. There was a lack of another feeling as well, empathy. And that void had been growing.

The nothing extended from my house to the horizon. I felt a burst of energy hit me. It was a shockwave of energy, air rushing in to fill the negative pressure area I had created. It stunned me for a second, left me shaking on the floor of my office. But I sat up in pain, looked out beyond where my wall used to be, and I gasped. It was as if a rectangle had cut through the Earth, exposing stone and the innards of our planet. I heard rumbling, saw a strange red liquid flow out of where the mountain used to be. It was as if the blood of the planet had been spilt, and I looked down and saw the knife in my hands.

I tried to sit up but it was much too painful. It felt like the shockwave had knocked the breath out of me, even broken a rib or two. I heard screaming, heard cars starting, peeling out. I found myself not caring what they felt, not caring about their fear or their sense of emergency, and found it very easy to tune their fears out and the sudden feeling of emptiness overwhelmed me with a sense of nirvana. I felt a lack of want, a lack of need, a lack of existence. It was the most peace I had ever felt, more so than that island vacation, more so than the first time I had tried heroin, more so even than the time I had almost overdosed. As the empathy left me, so did the fear. The trembling in my hand and body stopped, and I sat up.

Should I? Yes. Yes, I should.

*Control-A.*

I look around, took in that last image of the entirety of existence, a light hue of blue.

Goodbye.
