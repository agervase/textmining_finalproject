"Bye."

"Have a good one!"

The chorus of the families and friends echoed around the dubious metal structure as their eyes shut and their bodies went limp. In this area were encased 236 citizens of Degalsfield for *Shutdown Day*.

I saw as Mrs Popinto carefully rearranged her hair and waved merrily to her three children located above her at bizarre perpendicular angles. Suspended by what looked like dark bungey jump thread.

"See you soon 2108." said Mrs Popinto with her last words before the hibernation process took hold of her.

I had no one to say goodbye too. All those I had known or had been close to had been wiped by the early attempts of the Royal nation of Islandic alliances to stop the population growth by any means possible. I was a survivor. I had made it and I would be preserved and part of the future of humanity. All I could think about was. Why me? I had no skills they wanted in the *New Society*. When I had said to the recruiter, my situation. He smiled and said, "You will fit in perfectly with Degalsfield A43 deployment."

It was silent. Everyone was still. What would it feel like to have to be in hibernation? The government guaranteed that the technology was safe.

1 minute passed and then two minutes. I opened my eyes. It was still daylight. It was the same strange scene of capsules and different angles, expressionless faces. They did not move.

A claxon sounded.

"Clean up Degalsfield A43"

"Clean up Degalsfield A43"

Dark suited figures appeared out of nowhere and started spraying liquid onto the hibernating people. In a matter of seconds where Mrs Popinto and her 3 children had been, there was now only a pale green sludge.

"Time I was getting out of this!" I thought to myself.

I leapt to my feet and rushed to the nearest exit. As I reached daylight, I knew I was free. A narrow escape to a horrific end. What to do for the next 90 years? Not sure survive somehow. At least I was alive. The only thing was that I felt a distinct burning sensation in my left leg.
