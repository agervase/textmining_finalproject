The medication doesn't work.

There have been countless amounts of exams with the neurologist, all of them inconclusive. It's no matter, I stopped calling, stopped taking the dose altogether. With a condition like mine, you got to accept that *you* are the side effect. Or furthermore, what you create.

I was told I had a gift, a gift I ought to acknowledge. I was placed on headlines and plaudits were spun into a million threads and then, stitched to me. At first I didn't understand it. *Couldn't* understand it. Thought it was a joke, a prank. I'd been talent-less my whole life, the perfect definition of grey. And for the first time in my life, I could create something other than average, more than standard. Did I know what the paintings meant half of the time? Of course not, but I learned to embrace it.

But of course, there came a time when I wished to abandon it. I awoke to harsher, darker colors. And even more macabre, violent images. The paintings were *angry* and unruly, not palsy and elated like before. Now they were splashes of hot anger, unspoken and bloodlust thoughts, bleeding on the canvas. Now, they had razor edges.

I tried to cover it up, tried to paint masterpieces like the others on my own, but my fingers wouldn't cooperate. None of it could earn attention, and if it did then the wrong kind, as I had feared the paintings would that I began to depict when I blacked out. I didn't know what my mind was trying to tell me. So I ignored it, or simply painted over with brighter, happier colors. It usually didn't work. The luridness screamed back in response, **"You can paint over me but I will still be here."**

I've thrown away all of my art supplies, trashed all of the art, save for one. The latest creation... No this one, I *have* to submit. But I do understand that it will be the last thing I do before a bail. 

The police are on their way to identify the body, if they can, from what's left of it.
