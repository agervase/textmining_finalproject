It was a whisper. It may have been a joke. I didn't mind and keep going. Buenos aires, the birth place of Tango. I was planning to go to "El Caminito" on the afternoon, but first I needed to get my luggage on the Hotel.

It was a rough week, On Monday I went from Nigeria to India, then on Tuesday to Melbourne, on Tuesday to France, and then immediatly to the Antarctica. A rough week for a climate scientist. It was a short stay on Antarctica, and I was ready to rest a little bit on Buenos Aires, before going back to my place in Arizona.

Also, let me tell you, the jet lag can be horrible when you travel so much, specially if you consider the time changes, the noise of the plane and the eternal summer in Antarctica. Of course it was an allucination.

I inadvertelly slept in my hotel room and woke up. A quick shower and ready to go to "El Caminito", while taking a shower, an earthquake!. I couldn't get out, but no alarms. I tried to open the window, but it was completely dark.

I felt completly dissorientated, as if I was in an airplane again. I took some pills and said, better to sleep some more.

On the morning a bright light came from the window that was still open. But the landscape was different than the previous day. It feel strange. There were not people walking on the street, and the previously loud city felt abandoned. I went to the reception and asked for a map of the city. Attlantis was the tittle.

I was perplexed when I went outside the hotel. A giant dome, so big that you couldn't see the end and taller than the highest skyscrappers I can imagine. Outside the dome, on the top I could see the sea, but it was partially underground. I decided to go to the town hall.
