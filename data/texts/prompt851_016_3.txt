“Gol-darn, sure is a buncha folks gathered round here. I wonder what they’s about?” Billy said as he gawked at the crowded stands. 

He had never seen so many people in one place. In fact, the county fair was the largest crowd he’d ever seen – until now. There appeared to be millions of spectators all seated above him looking down. It was almost as though they were all looking at him.

“Gee, I must’ve come in the wrong door. They’s all starin’ at me,” remarked Billy. “I’ll just go ahead and vacate myself out the back way,” he said as he slowly backed away. 

“BILLY, YOU STAND BEFORE THE FIELDS OF DESTINY. HERE YOU WILL FACE ALL OF THE LIVES YOU’VE STOLEN IN YOUR TIME ON EARTH!” Boomed a voice from the sky.

Billy stopped mid-step and turned about with a puzzled look on his face and said, “Is you talkin’ to me?”

“BILLY, HERE YOU ARE TO BE JUDGED FOR YOUR SINS IN LIFE. FACE YOUR DESTINY,” said the voice in the sky. 

“Oh, he must be talking ‘bout some other Billy,” said Billy as he continued to try and find the Exit.

“NO, BILLY. I AM TALKING TO YOU,” cried the voice in the sky – sounding slightly annoyed.

“How do you reckon? We goes to Church every Sunday like good folks,” said Billy.

“BILLY YOU HAVE SLAIN COUNTLESS INSECTS AND SMALL ANIMALS. YOU ARE TO BE JUDGED,” said the voice.

“Aw yea, there’s nobody better in the whole town at gettin’ rid of critters than me!” Exclaimed Billy.

“BILLY, NO OTHER HUMAN HAS SLAIN AS MUCH OF MY SMALL CREATURES AS YOU!” The voice yelled.

“You mean I’m number one? Do I win something?” questioned Billy.

“NO. YOU ARE TO STAND TRIAL BY COMBAT FOR ALL OF THE LIFE TAKEN. BEFORE YOU STANDS EVERY LIFE YOU HAVE TAKEN. IF YOU FAIL TO DEFEAT THEM YOU FACE ETERNAL PUNISHMENT.” Said the voice.

Billy finally noticed the vast swarm of creatures standing in front of him.
“Hey, did you know you have a real bad infestation? Prolly the worst I’ve seen – and I’ve seen some bad ones,” asked Billy.

“NO. I BROUGHT THEM HERE FOR YOU TO...” said the voice.

“I sees your problem. You done let all these critters loose and now you can’t get rid of them. I remember this one time, Sue-May – she’s the town mayors daughter,”

“BILLY…”

“why she brought home this cute lil’ mouse that she had caught. It escaped, and you know how them mice be,” said Billy as he slyly winked. “Next thing you know, her whole house is full of them. Good thing they knew ol’Billy. I took care of them mice right quick.”

“BIL…”

“Hey that must be why you brought me here I reckon. I am number one right?”
Billy looked over the army standing in front of him. “It’s gonna be a tough job, it ain’t gonna be cheap!”

“NO. BIl…”

“It’s a good thing you got me here, I’ll get that sorted out for you!”

“BI..”

“Quiet now and let a man be about his work. I gots an infestation to kill.”
