Everywhere I go, there are cameras flashing and microphones to my mouth. Everybody loves me, even the heroes below me always show admiration and respect towards me. Truth is, all of my accomplishments, all of them, have nothing to do with me. That one giant robot that's been terrorizing the city? Malfunction in his new piece of armor. The genocidal lizard that killed his family and an entire elementary school? He tripped on his own foot and landed with his sword in his heart. However, there have been a few monsters recently that have just seemed to get torn apart out of nowhere. There was this one blur of a silhouette that I saw, in the midst of all the guts falling out. But when I tried to see it better, it had disappeared. At first I decided to ignore it but I kept on noticing it and it just became too much. The next day, in order to try and capture this mysterious character, I confronted a famous villain and tried talking to him/her as if (s)he was hiding in the bushes, waiting for the right time to strike. When the monster had been obliterated, I once again saw this silhouette, except it didn't disappear. It seemed as though it was getting closer. Finally a person arrived. It was a very bland looking guy that had on this yellow suit. I asked him if he saw the guy who beat this villain, and replied with, "That would be me!" I laughed a bit, thinking that it couldn't possibly be him, but when I saw his expression, he looked dead serious. He said "It seems that you finally found me out. I'm a lower class hero that has been looking for villains to beat, but every time I find one, some higher class hero that was at the scene gets all the credit, especially you!" I replied with, " how come you disappear so fast after every monster you beat though?" "I go around looking for more, killing monsters is my hobby and the only thing I enjoy," He said.
