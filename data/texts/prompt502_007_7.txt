We watched in silence as the white ships took wing.

Their passengers, envoys from distant lands, disembarked on our shores with wonder in their eyes and sweetness in their words. It was their first visit to the City of our Fathers and yet they spoke to us, from the very first greeting to the very last goodbye, in our own tongue. As fluent and articulate as any of our Brothers.

We noticed how light they suddenly became. Made weightless by some unknown spell, lifting off the altar pads like bladders full of air. Their immaculate surfaces gleaming red in the twilight. Thin jets of vapor hissed from their bellies and the vessels willed themselves up towards the clouds.

It had been many generations since the Fathers of our Fathers' Fathers built those altars. Made of ash and bone and stone, a tribute to the Visitors, landing pads for the thundering beasts they rode from the heavens.

We watched the white ships float gracefully into the skies. It was a rare privilege to witness a Visit. We who stood on that altar were at the end of our second. So we squinted at the clouds, savoring every moment, knowing we would not live to see a third.

Each Visit was different. Each vessel of a different banner, each crew of a different heart. Some brought color to our minds. Some took soil from our land. Some, we barely dared to remember, took sons from their Fathers. Still, we knew, they were all brothers. All one kind. All their monsters roared the same.

We saw a blinding flash from behind the clouds. We felt the thunder and we heard the roar, and we shook to our core as a streak of fire cleaved the skies. And we knew that they were gone.

There would soon be a new set of carvings on the temple wall. The tale of another Visit, for our Sons to remember. There were many stories now, and we knew more would be etched on the wall before the Last Father was born.

We looked up. And we wondered if one day the stone of another world might bear the likeness of our Children.
