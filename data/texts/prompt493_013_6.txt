How many years ago had that promise been?  A hundred?  Two?  Time took on a different meaning when you couldn't die.

Dave wiped the dirt off his face as he peered down the sights of his rifle, breathing steadily and trying to ignore his own dry, chapped lips.  It seemed like a blessing at first.  Somehow, when his daughter had made him promise not to die, it was like magic - arrows would fall just short of him.  Spears would miss their mark.

A ricochet, the metallic ping like tinnitus in Dave's ear as the return fire from the rebels erupted around him.  Order quickly dissolved into chaos as ten rifles rose as one, firing and firing and firing until the clatter of guns finally fell silent.  Dave dared to look around him, almost afraid of what he would find.

Nine soldiers dead.  Good boys, boys he'd gotten to know over the last few weeks.  There was Garry.  He was from Pennsylvania, good kid, bit of an ass.  Now he hung off the humvee, blood streaming from seven bullet wounds to the chest, and one to the head.  And Billy over there, Texas raised and born.  Boasted a lot about things being bigger in Texas - apparently that included egos.  His joking voice was silent now, a sniper's shot having torn through his throat.

Good kids.  With parents and girlfriends and sons and daughters.  David screamed into the sky, impotent rage surging through his body for the millionth time.  How many more times would someone else have to die in order for him to live?

Because after two hundred years, he'd learned the price of his daughter's request.

Everyone owed a death.  And when Death found it could not take Dave, it took those around him instead.

The desert did not answer his wail.  And after a moment, Dave's shoulders slumped.  He bent down, picked up his rifle, and trudged back to base.  Back to life.

Back to hell.
