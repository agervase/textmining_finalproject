The whispy haired cloak toting fuck ran out of my front door with a large potato sack, stuffed to the brim with my presents. My goddam presents and I don't give a fuck if that sweaty middle parting hobo's father heard that. I knew exactly why he would steal them, it all started last Christmas..

I'd heard a bump around midnight and ran down stairs with my double barrel shotgun, to find a large shadow emerging from the fire place. Without thought I shrieked and yanked the trigger, blasting a humongous hole into the red coated being in front of me. As I turned on the light I'd realised what I'd done, I'd fucking killed Father Christmas for the second year running, they only got a new one this year!! They should know that I, the Devil, do not tolerate intruders and have an excessive and evaporative memory when it comes to holding back my anger if someone enters my love dungeon, sorry, home. I knew that this guy was going to be clumsy, all night I'd tried staying awake so I didn't forget Santa's replacement was going to deliver the presents, he'd probably be a bit clumsy or loud.. I must of dozed off somehow, by accident though you have to understand! Anyway, I got a phone call the next morning from the big man upstairs saying "YOU'VE RUINED CHRISTMAS, AGAIN, GO FUCK YOURSELF NEXT YEAR IMMA FUCK YOURS UP. KNOW HOW LONG I WAITED FOR THAT VR HEADSET YOU LITTLE RED BITCH?!" He whaled on me for a good few minutes but to be honest, I was way too busy sharpening my trident to pay attention.  

I knew he'd get that crack head Jesus to do something, here's the thing though, I'd prepared for this. I had a friend waiting in my front garden with my double barrel shotgun, oh Jesus, did he make a mess of Jesus. God bless you and merry Christmas, Judas and I hope you enjoy that VR headset I got you in return. 

At least I won't have to buy God a Christmas card this year, the bloated gigantic fuck.
