*Artificial Entertainment: Where money cannot buy progress*

I stared at that screen for a few minutes. *Can't buy progress? Who the hell do they think they are kidding?* The last game I played, *The Endless Dungeon*, getting ahead meant one thing and one thing only: Swipe your card. Bothered by some player constantly outperforming you in tournaments? *Swipe your card*. Wanted to make it into the top lists? *Swipe your card*. It wasn't unheard of for new members of the top 20 (per server) to have taken out a second mortgage, just for the sake of an edge. Recurring Monthly Packages, "Special of the Month", One Time Flash Sales, and of course: the Buy Till You Are Broke options. Each were utilized in full force if a player wanted to go from being mundane to extraordinary.

This game, however....was vastly different. *Skill Frontier* operates on a system where you are actually penalized for spending money. Instead, the creators expect players to develop an intimate relationship with the game. To...*learn* the game, whatever the hell that means. There have been brief mentions of spreadsheets and "optimizers" (whatever the hell those are) on the budding subreddit to increase your chances of progressing and eventually taking a coveted position within the game's top 100 players. What units are best? How does one progress from "early" game to mid and late game? How does joining an active clan influence your potential progress? What the heck is Discord? Frankly I see the whole project dying off within a few months, as the notion of not being able to "pay to play" is ridiculous. 

At the same time though, what would the gaming world look like if we actually took things seriously as opposed to the whole *swipe your card* mantra? (Surely I can't be the worst player ever...) Hell with it. User name? T-I-L-L-M-O-R-N.
