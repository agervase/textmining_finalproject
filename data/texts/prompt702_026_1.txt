However, that doesn't mean you're still alive, so to speak. Every hour or so, you suddenly lose memory of everything that happened before. Your skin gets very pale and your pupils tend to disappear. After the first day of not taking your daily dose, you become delusional and begin seeing others as something you'd want to sink your teeth into. Your hair starts falling out and you begin feeling sick. You still regain most functions, although they are much slower than normal. 
As one of the CDC's newest recruits, you will be dropped into various locations worldwide and be put in the place of a normal citizen. You must monitor your site for anyone with any of the symptoms described. If any are spotted, notify command of such behaviour and where you saw it, and we will make sure to send reinforcements your way, ready to quarantine any subjects of the virus. 
You will have a normal pair of civilian clothes with you, as well as a uniform for your site. You will have a briefcase with a PDW inside, as well as 6 magazines, a silencer and 3 different sights, in case of an attack. If you don't have your briefcase with you, you will have a concealed handgun at your side and an extendable baton. If you are near or at your residence, your suitcase will contain a compact rifle, a siege shotgun, many magazines for both guns, attachments for tactical use and a machete for close quarters. 
If you have need of using any of your weapons, make sure to contact HQ so that backup can come help clear things up. 
One more thing before you go to be deployed at your sites, recruits, is that although no one will admit it, this is the zombie apocalypse. 
Good luck, and may the gods have mercy on us all.
