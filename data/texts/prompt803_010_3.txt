**Goose shit.**

I think I actually smiled. I know I broke one of the rules and looked up at a camera. I won't tell you the tale of bouncing through foster homes. Learning along side social studies how to avoid the eyes and hands of your new father. I won't talk about the dark days, give you the whole story - because honestly I don't really recall what is really real any more or what been colored over so much for different cons that my memory is truly fucked. I mean there are bad moments that can't change, but you shade a story so many times from so many angles and you loose sight of the paper truth.

I thought the two in the van had set me up. I didn't believe it, I didn't take it into my cold con man's heart, but I thought it. Hell I couldn't even check the backpack now. Had they somehow pulled a Hangman's Switch on me? Did I even have the money.

I trusted them, sure, but you don't live the life without that being your first thought. As i slowly raised my left arm, the comforting weight of eight hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars hanging in the backpack in my right.

If it was a Hangman, a mean a true Hangman I'd be dead in moments.

But my crew didn't kill. Mostly. There was the Lucky Carl we pulled in phoenix that went bad, but there's only so much you can do when the Rope falls in love the the Mark's bodyguard. No one was killed, but between the seven of us we caught three bullets and a piece of ceramic clown.

As they screamed at us I was again truly amazed by human nature.

"That's the biggest Con boy." Old-man Murphy used to say, who by the way is an elderly Chinese lady. But back in the days of her youth you didn't get to pick your own names. You wore what the others called you and tried to make it better. She used to say, "We get good boy, to a point where we can read the person, then the table, then the room. At some point, like understanding your parents weren't perfect we begin to realize almost everyone else is nothing more than a wind-up-clock of reactions. And that once you under stand the gears you understand the person. That's the biggest Con, and we play it on ourselves."

She was right of course, you can know, absolutely that the man will step in front of his child when the gun is shifted in their direction. Then he turns and runs.

Everything in my personal book told me a situation like this is a lot of quiet nervous people, men moving slightly in front of wives and children. It's not the screaming and crying you see in the movies. The problem is when your adrenal glands clam down like a co-ed mid world-shaking-first-orgasm your brain picks up a lot. It's why distractions work so well. Millions of years of evolution pointing all our senses in one direction.

Like a bad poker player that's when I looked up at the cameras. Everyone else staring down the idiots in clown masks and old shoes - that this one piece of advice. Buy shoes for the job, and burn them when done. Do you know how much evidence are on your feet?

But this brings me to my first point. **Goose shit.**

1914 Germany. July 7th. The worlds biggest distraction still ringing in everyone ears. The Kaiser will not attend the Arch Dukes funeral. Well... maybe not the biggest around that period in history but to the people there it was. Aden Wolfhezer, or Able Wolfhowzer or something of the like walks into this bank, strolls in like he owns the place. As he's robbing them a friend is stationed near by over powering the local radio broadcast to flood the bank with "news" that Germany will be going to war. At this point mind you its all fear and hope but nothing set. No one even looks at him as he exits the building with a large portion of the precious metal in his hand bag - brief case. He's three steps into the open when he slips on the stairs on - you guessed it - goose shit. Legs go flying up and it would have been funny I'm sure except he landed on his back, on the stairs, half a moment later 93 kilos of gold and silver slamming into his chest. He did not survive.

**Goose shit.** It doesn't matter how good the plan, there can always bee goose shit.

I'll probably get out of this. There is enough talent on the team that they are working the problem right now, but someone is going to see that video, the money is going to be missing, and I looked at the cameras when I should have been looking at the guns.
