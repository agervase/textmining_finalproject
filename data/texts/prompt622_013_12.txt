Heyyyyyyy Vsauce, Micheal here, but what is...here? To find out, I'm gonna be visiting an old buddy of mine Elohim. He lives upstairs and kind of "runs the show" so to speak. Elohim, thanks for joining us today.

GOD: It's always a pleasure Micheal, how've you been?

M: Wonderful! So let's just jump into it, what is the story of "here"? In other words, why do we exist?

G: I was surrounding by a void of nothingness and got bored, so I created the universe. This made a lot of people very angry and was widely regarded as a bad move.

M: Very interesting. And what can you tell us about your rival, Lucifer?

G: Oh man haha, funny story. Rebellious edgy kids, you know how they are. He challenged my authority so I had to kick him out of the house. But these days? He's actually doing well for himself, running the downstairs branch. I'm so proud. 

A single tear rolls down God's cheek.

M: What a touching story of redemption. Now of course, this wouldn't be true journalism without a hard hitting question and that is...the problem of evil. If you are indeed a truly benevolent and all powerful being, why would you allow evil to exist?

G: That's one of the top questions I get asked, and it is a tough one. Think about it in terms of a parent allowing their child to make mistakes, instead of being a "helicopter" so to speak. I take a very hands off approach. Improvise, adapt, overcome. Humans have become incredibly resilient in the face of adversity, even if some of that adversity is their own doing. 

M: Congratulations with your new promotion to deity of the Andromeda Galaxy. Who will be replacing you?

G: Bob.

M: Bob...who?

G: The Builder. Yes He Can!
