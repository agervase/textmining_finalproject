Existence, time, space, life, death... You're probably thinking there must be a higher power behind all this.  

You would be right. I am that higher power. The highest of all. Mere mortals, demigods and gods tremble at the mention of me... They call me "God" for my true name is unpronounceable by all except me.  

To say that my throne has been coveted by many is an understatement. I do so rather enjoy blasting those who dare challenge me into another plane of existence, one that I like to call "death".  

And yet, *you're* here. You don't even look old enough to drink. Yet you warped through spacetime, crossed the multidimensional thread of universes and trespassed your way into my realm. Against all odds, defying all reason and logic... What I don't get though... is why you wasted that talent on coming here, "chosen one".  

You aren't the first and will not be the last. You could have used your effort doing good in the world I created. Donate food and money, provide relief for those in need, or even find a cure for cancer. You could make your world a better place and the world would thank you for it. Yet somehow, you're **here**. You entered the 78th plane of existence, and crossed into the realm of creation, entering the Palace of Eternity, all for what? Defeating ***me?***  

Boy, you should have sent whatever god hired you to fight me. At least then they will stand a chance against my powers. Or fight back. Or do anything other than turn into a pile of ash. You may turn back and start anew, and I'll forget this ever happened. Choose your next move very carefully. There is a thin line between bravery and foolishness.  

The boy recklessly charged at me, weapon in hand.  

Zap. Now he wasn't.
