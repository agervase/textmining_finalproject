The sound of colliding metal filled my ears, and then everything went black.

I opened my eyes. The light was harsh and blinding; it almost felt surreal. My vision was blurred and out of focus, but I appeared to be in a relatively empty room with sterile, fluorescent overhead lights. The gentle pressure and cool feeling of bedsheets told me that I was lying down in a bed somewhere. 

As my vision returned, the world came into focus. I was lying down in a hospital room bed. Tubes and wires connected my body to various instruments around the room. Aside from myself and the web of machines surrounding me, the room appeared to be empty.

I called out for someone, but it was to no avail. I was still too weak to raise my voice above the sound of the machines. Without a way to disconnect myself or get help, I waited... And waited...

After some time, a man wearing a clean, white coat entered the room. He introduced himself as my doctor and explained the events surrounding my hospitalization: I was in my car driving down the highway. It was raining, and the driver in front of me started hydroplaning and lost control. I had tried to get out of way to avoided hitting the car, but ended up being hit by a semi-trailer in the process.

The doctor explained that my car was unsalvageable, but the police had managed to recover the dashcam footage. He asked if I would like to see it, suggesting that it might help jog my memory of the events. I obliged.

The footage confirmed the doctor's story. The visuals showed a car losing control, followed by a sudden shift which implied that I had tried to move out of its way. The audio, however... There was an unfamiliar voice that came right before the impact. The sound of a woman's scream. Who was this? Why were they in my car? Why would I let a hitchhikerâ€”

My thoughts were interrupted by the doctor. "Unfortunately, you were the only survivor in your vehicle. Your wife passed away at the scene of the crash."
