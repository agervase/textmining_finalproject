####A/N: My first WP. Constructive criticism and feedback is much appreciated. Thanks guys.


Murph stared glassy-eyed at the phone, waiting. How long had it been? An hour? Two? He didn't know. A throbbing, dull ache in the side of his neck told him it was time for his pills. These days, getting up was an effort; he braced his hands against the armrest and heaved himself off the chair, staggering into the bathroom. 

The only time he'd every get a bit of life back was when Jude called. Which was, now, never. The endless cycle had taken its toll on him. The spirited, rugged man who could hike five miles and still laugh around at a campfire with his daughter and her friends, grab a beer with their fathers was gone. In his place, there stood a wizened, stooped, wrinkled man with nary a hair on top of his head. 

"Dammit, Jude. Where are you!" he growled, with surprising intensity. 

He'd had enough. He needed to clear his head. 

It took him ten minutes to get everything and make his way to the door. Inhaler, check. Pills, check. Blue-glowy-thingy, check (he'd always have that one, Jude gave it to him in case of an emergency.)

The cold winter night pierced his lungs, as cold as that bitch Jenny, his ex-wife. He huddled closer and started down the near-abandoned street. Nearly everything was closed, it was creeping up to midnight after all. But this was the smack middle of the 401 freeway; there was bound to be some 24/7 open. 

He neared a bright convenience store after about half an hour, the sign hung crooked and amid the stains, dirt and grime of nearly fifteen years on the window, it read "OPEN". He pushed his way in, covertly checking for signs of a camera or watchmen. The lone cashier was sprawled in his chair, snoring the night away, with a half-empty beer and a old laptop with muted TV-show-thing that started with N, running in the background. He never could get that name right. 

The sneaking around, creeping in the cold, subterfuges in the middle of the night.... They all brought back memories of childhood, of simpler times. Times when the thrill of the chase was everything. That same thrill, despite being a mere shadow of what it was, rushed back to him in an instant.

He savored it. 

He walked in with a steady foot-after-foot, trying to make as little noise as possible. Reaching the end of the aisle, he glanced around one last time, making sure that there was no one in sight. 

It was like a he was in a trance; he started shoving entire racks worth of items and merchandise into the white garbage bag he had brought. Cans of soup, toothbrushs, condoms, pens, everything he could grab. 

He hurried out as quickly as he could, trying to maneuver the heavy bag with his weak arms. 

*BANG*

The bag was flung in the air, an expletive filled the air and the drunk cashier jerked awake. The most jarring was the uniformed sherrif he had just bumped into.

"What in the name of-" a rough voice uttered. 

***************************

The handcuffs were a blur, he couldn't remember what happened after bumping into the sherrif and being bundled into his car. He couldn't remember the ride to the station. But the worst of all, he couldn't remember why he decided to do it.

*******************************

As a child, he would often get caught shoplifting, it never amounted to anything serious, just a stern reprimand and an occasional call to the father. I always hung my head, looked at my shoes and promised not to do it again. Except when my father came. I'd raise my head and look him straight in the eye, not saying a word. 

It was the only time he acknowledged me. 

**************************************

I sat on the lumpy cot, staring at the bars in front of me. 

*Why*

The question stil rebounded in my head.

I closed my eyes, lost in memory lane.

Suddenly the bed shifted, as if another person was sitting next to me the whole time. A faint scent of jasmine lingered in the air; her favorite perfume.

Jude. Finally.

Without opening my eyes, I whispered my voice broke, "Why didn't you call, Judy. You promised you'd call." 

In my mind, I saw my father. When they opened, I saw Jude. 

I started to sob.

Joe sat in the mental healthcare center's criminal ward, annoyed and frowing at the stack of papers in front of him. Paperwork again. That 'old man who robbed a store' case was taking up too much time; he was getting late. He remembered receiving the case, handed to him by his supervisor. He had talked to the SW handling the case, she was particularly passionate about the man. It seemed that she'd done everything for him, cooked his meals, cleaned his place and taken care of him.  

At least that social worker was hot, he visualized her soft curves, great smile in his head, an appreciative grin of his own fighting its way onto his face. He had her number too. 

*Why not?* 

He pulled out his phone, searcing for the contact. Jude was it?
