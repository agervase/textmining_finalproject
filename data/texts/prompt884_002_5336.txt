I sit in the dimly lit room where he put me, and I laugh.  Little does he know what he's facing.  I don't even try to free myself from the chair - he's tied me there arms and legs with a strong nylon rope.  It doesn't matter.  My body count is higher than his is.  He's in store for a shock.  


I hear footsteps.  The door creaks open.  There he is, a creepy looking fellow carrying an axe.  I guess he intends to chop me to bits, but I just smile.  My body count is higher.  


"What are you smiling at," he growls, rubbing the axe blade with his finger and thumb as if the blade is a kitten he's petting.  


"My body count is higher than yours," i reply.  


"Is that so," he asks, holding out the axe, measuring the distance between us. He's getting ready for a good strike,  By the looks of it, his plan is to start with a chop to my legs - don't kill me right away, make me suffer.  He's that type of sicko who gets off on other people's suffering.  


"Your body count don't matter.  You're all tied up.  Looks like your body count comes to an end."  


He lifts the axe for the blow - right to the legs by the looks of it, so I was right.  


In through the window crashes one body, through the door come another three.  They're all me - I have lots of me's all in my control.  They grab him, grab the axe, beat him to the ground.  One unties me.  


I take the axe.  Four other me's step aside.  The killer tries to rise, but he's been beaten pretty bad.  He can't get up.  


I raise the axe for the killing blow.  "I told you," we all say in unison, "my body count is higher than yours."
