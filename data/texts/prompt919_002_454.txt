"It’s… it’s binding, my lord," the priest sad, delicately removing the soulglass from his eyes. "As good as ours. I’ve never seen anything like it. Except, you know. Our stuff."

"Binding?" The Divine Pandyax slammed his fists on the table, leaving behind twin craters of darkforce. "What the fuck do you mean, *binding?* Is there some sort of cosmic fucking *registry* or something for recording deeds to souls?"

His priest helplessly shrugged. "All I know is we can’t collect, my lord."

"We’re not happy about it either," the ____ said, his countless rows of razor-sharp teeth folding through themselves in four dimensions.

"Well is there a fucking *recording date* then?" Pandyax asked, exasperated. "Who had priority?"

One of the _____'s adjuncts approached Jeremy Blake. To his credit, the human still sat patiently, a little more comfortable now that Pandyax's priest had found the folding chair. 

The adjunct touched a small device on its face. Rings of light appeared in front of what were perhaps its eyes, a HUD with quickly changing lines of data readout. "There is no such date that we can behold," the adjunct said, its machine-translated voice flat and warbly. "Merely the presence of the… ahem… gods'… claim."

"I don't like how your creature referred to my divinity, Xs… Dzc… Fucking unpronounceable Nit. I'm going to call you Nit."

"Please do not," the ____ said wearily.

"Well I'm gonna," Pandyax snorted, knowing that he sounded petulant, and irritated by it. "Fuck. Where are the parents? Maybe they can help."

"Both dead," Jeremy offered helpfully. "Like two years back. They got trapped in an escalating power struggle, culminating in a final battle that tore our state off the map. You know how it is. I was in college so I didn't see a lot of it, but it seemed bad whenever I talked with them on the phone."

"Fuck," Pandyax groaned.

"Agreed," the ____ said.

"What do you even need it for?" Pandyax demanded. 

"If you're in the business of collecting souls, you ought not need to ask," the ____ responded, a little haughtily. 

"Won't you just drop your claim? If you're like us, I know you at least *can."*

"No. Would you? Jonathan Blake's power came at considerable cost to us. I expect the boon granted Corinthia Blake is no different. We are not in the habit of writing off investments so easily."

"Nit," Pandyax muttered under his breath. "Okay, then what do you suggest? Split the boy? Can we even? I'm not sure I ever have." Pandyax looked over to his priest and arched a questioning eyebrow. The priest threw his hands up, utterly baffled. The man was out of his element.

"If it matters, I'm against that," Jeremy said.

"Impossible," the ____ said. "It would destroy the core."

"Exactly," Jeremy agreed, nodding. "You don't want to destroy the core."

"Well," Pandyax's priest said, "certainly there is no court with jurisdiction that *I* know of."

"The document of things *you* don't know is obviously pretty fucking large," Pandyax said, throwing a plastic cup at his priest. "But you're right. So what? Binding arbitration? Maybe a contest?"

"I don't think-" the ____ began.

"Oooh, I know!" the god exclaimed, clapping his hands, emitting puffs of darkforce. "We can have my man wrestle… that. Your thing." He pointed at the adjunct, who snorted.

"That… won't do, but…" The ____ made an inscrutable tic gesture that might have indicated thoughtfulness.

"Having something in mind, are we, Nit?"

The ____ paused to count to three and collect himself before continuing. "We gave both Blake parents power, yes? And they fought. If there is a way to determine who won, perhaps we can say that *that* camp is the victor, with better claim to the soul?"

Pandyax narrowed his eyes, considering. "Deal. *If* we can figure it out conclusively."

Both beings turned to face Jeremy. "Well, boy?" the ____ asked. "You said your parents killed each other. Do you know who died first? Who was the victor in their fight, even if that person died shortly thereafter?"

"Oh, I didn't say they killed each other," Jeremy said.

"No," Pandyax huffed, "You distinctly informed us that-"

"I said they fought, and killed a lot of people. I was at college. They slaughtered pretty much all of my home friends, though. I couldn't let it go on, you know? It was only going to get worse."

"Then-"

"So *I* killed *them,* " Jeremy said cheerfully, "but not before I took their power. Like so." Jeremy held up his hands, and an dark cord of energy burst from his palms. Pandyax, more confused than concerned, cast a barrier, which should have been enough to forbid any darkforce from touching him, forget harming him. But there was something else, some other power laced through the attack that Pandyax couldn't even sense. The god was incinerated where he stood, with barely even ash remaining. His priest shrieked in despair, pulling a dagger from his belt, but Jeremy popped his head off with a flick.

"Oh f-" the ____ began, and immediately threw up shields, but they might as well have been paper against the darkforce-buttressed assault. Jeremy intertwined his fingers, and as he twisted them, the space around ____ twisted as well, shrinking till it crushed all matter to a mere single point. The adjunct sat heavily on the floor, staring dumbly at nothing in particular, unable to function without the ____'s controlling mind present.

"Dicks," Jeremy said. He folded up the chair - it was a nicer sort, wood with fake leather seating, so he figured he'd keep it - and left.
