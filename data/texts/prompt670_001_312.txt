The High Scholar inhaled as he eyed the data slab incredulously.


"Variks, tell me more of what you saw. Tell me more of these... *Flame Enders*"


"By the first pack, High Scholar, I have never seen anything like it. These... Humans... These *Savages* think themselves high enough to tamper and impede on the will of the Flames!"


The gaze of High Scholar Mahak listed over to the description of the blasphemous *Flame Enders*


"Variks, in your report, you stated that these... *Flame Enders* were coated in some sort of polymerized canvass environmental coverings?"


"Yes High Scholar, the lower Scholars and I theorize that the bright colors and markings on these covers are for identification of pack bonds and mating capability. It appears as though this pack of Humans mates within the fire and the extinguishes them afterwards... There is no other explanation as to why a sentient creature would enter a burning building or range of trees willingly."


High Scholar Mahak sighed. 


"You mean to tell me that this race *fornicates* within the Eternal Power of Flame and then *quells it when they finish* ?  I do not believe I need to tell you how idiotic that sounds"


"Yes.. High Scholar. I shall look into the habits of these *savag-*"

"Humans"

Prompted Mahak.



"Yes. Apologies, Great One. I shall research these... *Humans* in greater detail. I shall take one and ask them of their *Flame Ending* Pack."


Standing and placing the dataslate down, High Scholar Mahak spoke with a commanding tone:  "I shall be the one to speak with the Human. I wish there to be no miscommunication due to a lower status scholar making a mistake. Leave and recover a specimen at once, I shall be in my study."
