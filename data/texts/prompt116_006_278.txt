I had done nothing wrong.  I mean sure, some of these charities were merely fronts for slipping the money into my own back pocket, but *most* of them were legitimate!  All I wanted was for humanity to reach its highest peaks, and we could only do that by working together!  

"I've found you at last!"  A cold strong voice boomed into my lair.

The Howard smirked, cool and remote.  His tanned and chiseled body glistening in the sun.  

I cried out, somewhat owlishly and cravenly, "You'll never stop me, what I do, I do for the good of humanity!"  

In the breadth of a breath he trounced me, tying me up and declaring me to be another victim of the glory of man and the free market.

I was wrong.  He could stop me.  He believed in liberty, in freedom, in the choice of the individual.  I was no match for his industrious ways.  Though I wanted humanity to succeed, it was only the individual who could accomplish greatness.

"Yes, Emozo, I have caught you!  Your nefarious ways will plague the great individuals of humanity no longer!  Thousands of years ago, when man first discovered fire..."

**Ten Hours Later**  

I gnawed at my bindings.  I craved only the freedom.  Not the freedom of the individual, but the freedom of death.  Alas, The Howard did not believe in that sort of freedom, and so he droned on...  

"The ‘common good’ of a collective—a race, a class, a state—was the claim and justification of every tyranny ever established over men...."  

And on...  

"It had to be said. The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing."  

And on..  

"I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society. "  

I could not take it anymore and I chewed ferociously in order to achieve one thing.  One last act of the individual.  I chewed on my gag until I choked on it, projecting my desperation at The Howard.  

Sadly, his desperation outweighed mine with all the force of all the free markets of the world.
