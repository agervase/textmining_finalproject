{Get To Safety}. The command was clear as day. I threw the blanket off of my body, scaring my dog in the process, and scrambled to get to my feet and into my slippers. I scanned the room to see what could be lingering in the corners. No gunmen, no burglars, no bogeyman made manifest. But the command was there. I wasn't safe.
So what could it be? My dog whined and nudged her nose against the palm of my hand, pushing her body against my knees. She could feel it, too. I know she could. My heart was pounding, my head was swimming. I staggered to my window and peeked through the blinds to see the empty road of my neighborhood before me. *Get to safety, get to safety. Where was my car? Get to safety.*

Why wasn't it helping me? I left it all behind me the last time I moved. I WAS safe. I had to be safe. They promised me I was finally safe. So what the fuck was the issue? My dog continued to press up against the back of my knees and begged for me to find the problem, to find the issue that would find me if I didn't work fast enough. The knot in my stomach wrenched it's way up into my throat. I couldn't breathe. *Get to safety, why the fuck aren't you running, why are you just standing here?*

And so I waited. I crouched down underneath the window, too terrified to keep watch over the road. I gasped for air as I sat on my bedroom floor, my dog wrestling her way onto my lap, whining and looking up at me. I placed my hands against her ears, stroking her head. *I don't know what to do.* I sat there for a few hours. *I don't feel safe.* I could hear the birds starting to sing outside, the sun just starting to rise from over the roof of my neighbor's house. *You'll never be safe again.*

I couldn't help but cry. I wanted to vomit. I hugged my dog tightly against my chest.

Another sleepless night.

*Why can't I just be normal?*

At around 9 AM, my next command finally entered my vision. I let out a sigh of relief. {Go To Work.}
