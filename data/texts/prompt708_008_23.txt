You jerk your handle to the right, bumping off the forest trail into the overgrowth; The squirrel you nearly ran over dropped its acorn in shock, and bolted into the forest. Laying there dazed on the floor, you spot a unusual white mark on its tail, before the squirrel disappears.  
*How am I going to explain to my parents that I ruined my new jeans and scratched my bike to avoid a Squirrel?!*  
Picking yourself up from the ground, you amble home, the incident forgotten, just another anecdote of growing up.

*--Many years later--*

Wheezing, you dash through the forest, throwing regular glances behind you.  
*Hes catching up!*  
Blood seeped from a cut on your neck, stinging in the cold environment  
*So close, I just spun left in time*  
Leaping over the tree trunk, branches whipped in your face, as you desperately ran towards the source of the sirens  
*Its him, "Throat-Slicer" Sam! Infamous serial killer who approached his victims in secluded locations and slit their throat. 8 victims to date.*   
A voice suddenly rang over the darkness:  
"Sam, the police have you surrounded! Give yourself up!"  
 *Someone must have seen us! Just a little more to safety!*  
In response, you heard Sam only roar with anger, and increase his speed, waving a knife over his head.   
Putting on a final burst of speed, you crashed through the growth, onto a narrow, disused forest trail. You see them, policemen dressed in full protective gear dashing towards you  
*Not close enough. Can't make it!*  
Suddenly, you hear a crash behind you. Stumbling around in surprise, you see Sam having caught his foot in the roots of a small acorn shrub, lying stunned on the ground as the policemen tackled him.  
*Safe at last*  
Looking around in the trail, a particular funny moment of your adolescence snaked into your mind.  
*Could it be?*  
Gazing past the sight of Sam being carried to a van, the rest of his life destined behind bars, you see a squirrel stare at you, white mark on its tail, before bolting into the forest.
