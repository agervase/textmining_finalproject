Kha'hi scratched his head. This was definitely, positively not in the dossier that he has received from the upper ranks.

"How is this possible?" 

His eyes glazed over the terran scenery that spread before him: sea of flames, with remnants of local housing structures made of wood and artificial stones. He could not take off his helmet because the oxygen count was too high and atmospheric pressure too much to bear; nonetheless, he could feel the fire that burns in front of him. In the fire, along with the local flora and structures, were his soldiers.

They have been trained for 3 Hanran years to prepare for the invasion. They have met and exceeded every physical tests the military could throw at them. They have even gone through harsh simulated environments of Earth.

What they could not, however, guess were the presence of sapient earthlings. They mentioned nothing of sorts; it was supposed to be inhabited by carbon-based lifeforms so primitive they could not forge their own metals. Yet--

"Incoming!" yelled Tenteq over the comm, followed by explosions.

They were prepared to eliminate all threats, and were armed with the best the Hanra could offer: powered suits, with capabilities for space exposure, and state-of-the-art plasma blades.

Except those blades are useless if they're hit by projectiles capable of puncturing spaceship hulls. And if they can puncture spaceship hulls, the powered suits mean nothing.

From the distance, armored ground vehicles approach. How primitive--they cannot even hover. He would have laughed, except one of those tracked monsters wiped out three of his platoons before retreating. And it sure as hell was more than what they prepared for.

Perhaps it was time to go, Kha'hi thought. Millions of miles away from home, with even quantum communications taking multiple earth days before they can get the next order from the homeland--

--they may not even survive until the report arrives at the capital in Dan-tyri.
