Kep'lar hadn't asked for this.  It was supposed to be a quiet final tour of duty before his retirement.  A quick nip around the backwaters to remind the outer patrols that they were being watched.  It was announced well in advance, so everyone had a chance to clean up their messes before he arrived.  So why the frek did he have to deal with this?

"Captain Gra'tak, you are charged with removing six barely sentient beings from their home planet and placing them in an orbital prison for observation.  How do you plead?"

"Not guilty, Admiral."

"You expect me to believe that they just walked into an orbital prison?  Jumped?  Wished really hard?"

Gra'tak cleared his throat.  "No, sir.  They flew up in--"

"Quiet!  You will only answer questions you are asked!  I didn't ask you to make up stories!  They have no wings!  They are not adapted to vacuum.  This species is at least, by your own reports, over two hundred cycles from earliest possible development of anti-grav plating!  So the question is why did you pull these six specimens from the surface of their world and trap them in a pressurized container?  They could have been injured if they figured out how to open the hatches!"

"I did not do it, sir."

"So you neglected to mention their advanced spatial phasing technology in your reports?"

"No, sir.  No spatial phasing."

"Well, mag-lev strong enough to reach orbit would have wiped out their primitive electronic infrastructure.  They are nowhere near anti-grav.  Did they spontaneously appear in your pressurized terrarium?"

"No, sir.  They did not spontaneously appear, and it is not my box.  They built it--"

"Kva-plek!  They don't have the science!" 

Gra'tak took a deep breath and blurted, "They used rockets!"

"What?  They couldn't safely launch anything without technologies your own reports indicate they are unaware of.  Did you get careless?  Did you *share* our technology with primitives?"

"No.  They just made rockets and --"

The Admiral forcefully thumped his desk.  "Shut up!  I know you are lying.  With their level of technology, they can not safely launch biologicals from--"

"I didn't say safely, sir!"

Face darkening, Admiral Kep'lar demanded, "How dare you interupt me when I--"  He paused and looked Gra'tak over carefully, stood, and strode behind the young officer.  Leaning in close, he took a deep breath.  No sign of deceit.  A slight whiff of fear.  No anger.  Just ... frustration?  "Captain Gra'tak, do you wish to continue in your present position?"

"No, sir!  Not here, sir!"

Another whiff.  Truth.  Bizarre.  Nobody in their right mind would give up a Captain's cluster.  "Not here?"

"Sir, these humans are crazy, sir!"

"So crazy they mysteriously get into low orbit without the necessary technologies?"

"Sir, they use rockets powered by --" Gra'tak shuddered violently "-- hydrocarbons or water."

"What?!  Impossible! "

"Sir, I'm serious.  They have two methods to get into space.  The first is to take highly volatile hydrocarbons and place them into rockets either in liquid or solid form, put people on top of the cylinder in a cramped container called a crew capsule, then..." Gra'tak shuddered, "...then they ignite the hydrocarbons!"

<sniff> Truth. Impossible. "It would blow up!"

"Yes, sir.  Sometimes they do.  But these *humans* control the exposure to oxygen so they can control the burn rate ... sometimes."

<sniff> Truth.  Kep'lak stammered, "Bu-- but -- no sane person would do that!  Surely when the rockets explode, they give up!"

"No, sir.  They make new rockets."

Kep'lak shook his head.  *This is insane.  I'm missing something...* "You said there was a second method..."

"Sir, they use **water**."

"Water?  Di-hydrogen monoxide? One of the most corrosive materials in existence?  Impossible!" <sniff> *What?!* "Wait!  They **do**?  How would that even work?  Water would weigh them down."

"They split it into component elements by running a current through it.  They capture the released gasses and cool them into liquids.  These liquids are placed in separate storage tanks, and passed into a common chamber where they expand back into gasses."

<sniff> Truth.  And terrified.  "That wouldn't create enough force to create lift."

"Sir, then they ignite it."

"Madness!  That would just explode!"

"Yes, sir.  Pushing them up."

"But that would take millions of gallons of each!"

"Yes, sir."

"Have they detected you?"

"No, sir.  We should escape while we can."

"No.  A species this crazy must be monitored.  We will send additional science vessels and military support.  At least they are still working with molecular power.  Imagine the carnage if these fools had access to atomic power!"

Gra'tak cleared his throat nervously again, "Sir, they have many thousands of rockets with nuclear fusion warheads and have begun working with anti-matter."

"Frek!  I don't dare attack them openly with the resources we have here.  If they became aware of us, well, I have no idea what such an insane species would do!  Are there any asteroids in this system large enough to wipe out all life on the planet?"
