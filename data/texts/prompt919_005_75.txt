I was sitting at the head of the dining room table. On one side were beings of radiant, impossibly beautiful crystalline light, that flashed into a dizzying dazzle of rainbow glimmers at their slightest movement. At the moment, the light had a distinct rosy tint.

On the other side were animate blots of darkness, like droplets of curling ink trapped in thick clear oil. On occasion, orange-red flickers, like dying embers, could be seen in the deepest parts of their roiling skin. 

This is evidently how otherworldly beings look when they are deeply, *deeply* embarrassed. 

But not as embarrassed as I was. 

Because, I was still in a damp towel from the shower, and now, metaphysical incarnations of the ephemera of the universe were getting an up-close and personal look at my wet, hairy carcass. It was a kitchen towel. 

It was *tiny*. 

"Um, if I could begin-" the beings of light began, "-obviously, we need to have a bit of a *talk* about what is going to happen next. With you. Um. And them."

I'd known this was coming, funnily enough. When my parents both died in that firebreathing introductory class (they were run over by a confused stunt driver, long story) I'd recieved two wills, and with them, two other documents, (one on beaten silver, the other on what I *really hope* was just parchment paper with a watermark that just *happened* to look a lot like a tattoo) that indicated that with their death, I was now the agent of, well-

-One of the blots of sentient darkness coughed-

-*these idiots*. 

I just wasn't planning on seeing them so soon. And so... naked. 

...Fuck it. 

I feel awkward, they'll feel *worse*. 

I whipped off the towel.

(to be continued) (I'm going to the St. Patrick's Day Parade, will be back in a few hours)
