I didn't see any of this coming.

&#x200B;

The men in black tactical military gear came in the middle of the night. Their entrance into my slightly cramped one bedroom apartment was precise and relatively quiet, but still enough to wake me up. When I cracked open my eyes, the red lasers from their guns and bright white flashlights shined in my face. It all made me groggy and disoriented. Then I was completely blinded as someone slipped a black bag over my head.

&#x200B;

"Don't forget the computer!" I heard one of the men whisper-yell. 

&#x200B;

Was this an elaborate robbery and kidnap scheme? If so, they got the wrong person. I'm not rich nor am I important.

&#x200B;

Rough hands yanked me out of my bed. I stumbled, tripped over my feet as they pushed me in the direction of where they wanted me to go. I wanted to fight back but I was too scared to try. I tried to scream, but one of them tightened the bag at my neck so much I could barely breathe.

&#x200B;

They dragged me outside and placed me in a vehicle. I bucked back a little at them, my fight or flight reflex kicking in again. Unfortunately, my resistance was short lived -- I caught a hard punch straight to the jaw. As I toppled over inside the vehicle, more rough hands grabbed one of my arms. There was a prick of a needle on my skin, something that burned being injected into me, and then I was back asleep.

&#x200B;

Some time later, cold water splashing on my face startled me awake. When I finally opened my eyes, the white light from overhead blinded me. My vision was blurry. When I tried to move, I found my hands and feet bound to a chair. Panic welled up inside of me.

&#x200B;

"Oh, you're awake," came a strange male voice.

&#x200B;

My head snapped up. "Wha--who the fuck are you?"

&#x200B;

Cold water splashed on my my face again; its coldness forced an uncontrolled shiver to roll down my spine. He followed the water up with a backhand so forceful it split my lip.

&#x200B;

"You're not like I'd imagine you to be," the man quipped. He threw the empty cup at my face.

&#x200B;

"You probably got the wrong person. I'm not rich. I have no money."

&#x200B;

"I'm well aware," the strange man scoffed as he walked out my line of sight, standing behind me. "I know who you are, what you do. It's hard not to when you've got more than half of the United States' government after one 'average' guy."

&#x200B;

"What the hell are you saying?"

&#x200B;

"We -- Uncle Sam -- have been watching you for weeks, boy."

&#x200B;

I sputtered, trying to crane my neck to get a good look at him. "W-What? Why?"

&#x200B;

He turned my head to look forward as he came back around so I could see him. He produced a fancy badge wallet from inside his open black jacket. "United States Black Operations Division at your service. I'd tell you my real name, but that would be stupid."

&#x200B;

I stared at the 'Black Op,' lost, dumbfounded, and utterly confused.

&#x200B;

"Yes, yes, I've seen that expression before. On to business, however, as you're quite boring and not like other people I've interviewed," the Black Op rolled his eyes. "The government has been watching you, especially your Internet activity. We even managed to track you on the deep web. I know all about your addiction to designer drug MDMA -- and believe me we've been intercepting your packages, in case you were wondering where your last few orders have gone."

&#x200B;

"Fucking hell..." I muttered.

&#x200B;

"That's the least of your worries, though. What we really have been tracking is your acquisition of your star, and the communications you have sent to the Yakin."

&#x200B;

My heart dropped from my chest to my stomach. "How do you know about--?"

&#x200B;

The Black Op smirked. "Yeah. I know all about the little tokens you've been receiving from them. All the cute little messages you exchange with them. Why do you think you haven't received anything in a while?"

&#x200B;

I continued to stare at the Black Op, at a loss for words. I didn't see any of this coming.

&#x200B;

"We've established contact with the Yakin, but they refuse to deal with us. They will not communicate with us unless their Overlord is present and safe... Their fucking *Overlord*. Who apparently is--"

&#x200B;

"Not me."

&#x200B;

"--you."

&#x200B;
