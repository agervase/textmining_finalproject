As soon as /u/SovietWomble heard there was a universe where pay to win games were beginning to die to skill based games he decided to be among the exploration team to this skill based game universe whether they wanted him or not. Before the team was fully recruited he snuck on board the universe travelling capsule with his dog. Meanwhile the people sent to recruit popular youtubers and streamers that would be able to blend in arrived at Womble's flat. Upon arrival they find Womble forgot to lock his door and they called  out to see if he was stuck in the bathroom and any other closed doors in the appartment. All they found was a spare key with a sticky note saying it belongs to Clive and a rock named Clive with a hello my name is clive sticker on.  They locked the door and left an electronic note with a countdown timer telling Soviet he had 2 hours from when the note was placed to reach the capsule or he would be replaced on the flight and they have Clive's key incase Soviet got locked out by their actions. 

Womble was spotted in the capsule in a spare room where he froze in panic before someone told him "You are lost and should be in your seat I will take you to it. Also Clive's spare key was locked away in a command room locker for you if you forgot your key." Womble then stored his luggage he brought and made his way with his dog to the explorer seats trying to pretend he was supposed to be there; clueless he doesn't need to pretend everyone was having too much fun watching him pretend he is supposed to be there with the mindset of trying not to get caught as a stowaway. Womble kept his skill level and made a lot of fans. Womble kept up his monitoring of the other universe and decided not to return but made videos of him gaming for his fans in both universes.
