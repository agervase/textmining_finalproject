Groxor liked his job. All he had to do was to patrol the rim of the burning pit, stab every human who managed to crawl out, and then toss them back in. He enjoyed the screams, he was strong and nimble enough to thwart every escape attempt, and most of all, it had taken him millennia to find a task simple enough for him to avoid screwing up. Groxor, of all demons, knew his own limitations.

Which was why he was anxious, then perplexed, then frantic, when the shimmering blue portal opened in the air, just inches away from his face.

“What the…” he said. Groxor had limited experience with magic, and he wasn’t good at adapting to new situations. “Human… there?” he said, as the features of a young human coalesced into focus on the other side of the portal.

“… you can see me? Crap crap crap…” said the girl on the other end.

“Human… in… air?” said Groxor. Then, the gears clicked, and a momentary wave of relief washed over him. He was back on familiar ground. 

“Human try to escape! I stab!”

Groxor raised his trident, tensed his formidable muscles, and lunged at the portal.

---

*Holy crapballs! Why am I here?*

Groxor blinked, then flexed each appendage one by one, just like they taught him at the academy. It was a surefire way to determine if he had lost any limbs. Satisfied that he was whole, he sat up on the scorched earth, fumbling for his trident.

“Glow-thing disappear…” he said, as he tried to make sense of how he had passed right the portal, then tripped and fell. “Human… disappear…”

*Crap crap crap crap CRAP*

“Human where!” he said, as he leapt to his feet, shoulders hunched and tensed. “Come out human! Come let me stab! You no escape!”

*I’m here in your bloody head you idiot! Why am I here! Something’s wrong!*

Groxor turned around quickly a few times, but had to stop when his attempt at gaining the upper hand yielded no results other than making him dizzy. “You no hide from me! I stab you! If human escape, Morlas and Nuule tell Boss! Boss stab me!”

*Listen to me! Put your weapon down, and listen!*

Groxor obeyed. The tone of command in the voice was unmistakable. Besides, he was getting a headache.

*I’m Harriet Nestor, and I’m not supposed to be here! I was supposed to summon* you, *and you were supposed to lend me your strength and powers on Earth! But you startled me, and something went wrong, so now I’ve possessed you, do you understand? Nod if you understand!*

Groxor understood maybe one out of every three words, especially since she was speaking so fast. But he did as he was told, and he nodded.

*Can you get somewhere safe while I try to figure out how to reverse this? If I’m right, and I’m in Hell now, the other demons… let’s just say that if they knew I was here, they would not hesitate to kill me, get it?*

“Kill human good!” Groxor said, smiling. “I no wait for them, I stab you myself! Stab in head!”

*Then you would die too, idiot!*

Groxor thought for a while. “Yes, I stab my head, I think I die.”

*For heaven’s… I knew I shouldn’t have focused my search on brawn alone, geez!*

A strange sensation had been blooming in Groxor’s chest, radiating outwards from his core like blood from a stabbed human. He recognised it as panic, and the last time he had felt like this, it was when one of the Princes of Hell had dressed him down in front of his cohort, after Groxor had unwittingly set loose a couple of Bone Drakes about the castle.

Panic, mixed with a healthy dose of uncertainty and doubt. 

Groxor did not like this particular cocktail.

“Human in my head,” he said. “I have to tell Boss, I have to…”

*No, no! I’ve got a deal for you, ok?*

“Deal?”

*Look, you keep me hidden, give me time to un-eff this shitshow, and I’ll help you get things  you want, ok? Tell me, what is it that you want?*

Groxor paused. It had been some time since anyone had wanted to listen to him.

“I… want to go drink too… sometime,” he said. “Morlas and Nuule, they always promise, but they don’t let me go.”

*Who are they, these two… demons?*

“My… workers,” Groxor said. “We walk rim of pit, stab humans.”

*Where are they now?*

“They… went to bar, said they taking break. Said Groxor do work, and their work too, or they tell Boss that Groxor slow. They coming back now…”

Groxor winced as the otherworldly presence in his head rummaged around the meagre contents of his skull. If he had paid more attention in the academy, he would have recognised the signs of his memories being violated.

*Ah… I see… they have been bullying you, like this, for a long time?*

“Not bully,” Groxor said. “They said take turns. Next time I go, they say. But I never get to go. I want to go.”

The voice in his head fell silent, and as the seconds passed, Groxor wondered if he was free of his affliction. He had already written off the incident as stress coupled with his unfulfilled desire for the fine blood-grog they served at the bar, and was ready to return to his normal routine of stabbings, when the voice piped up again.

*Can you… summon your boss now? And do you think you can follow my instructions?*

Groxor drank so fast that the beverage ran over his mouth, down his chin and onto his timeworn tunic. In a way, he was gulping it down instead of savouring it, because he couldn’t quite believe that it had worked out. He was sure that his Boss would appear any minute, take away all the privileges he had been given.

After all, life had not been too kind to Groxor.

Until now.

*See? You did well!*

“Human smart,” he said, burping. “I follow you too, I smart too.”

It had been tricky, but the human was patient. She had told him what to say, *specifically* what to say, and though he had taken some time to rehearse the words, they seemed to work wonders.

*I told you your Boss would believe you.*

“Yes, yes,” said Groxor. “I say it again, I show you I learn. Boss! Morlas and Nuule are… slacking! I got proof! This their tridents! They are bar now! I do three demons’ work! I want raise, or I tell your Boss you no see Morlas and Nuule run!”

Groxor laughed, his belly rumbling as the blood-grog dripped to the ground.

“You good human, help me!”

*Now it’s your turn to help me. I need… I need a dragonstaff. You know what a dragonstaff is? I need it, tell me where I can find it.*

Groxor smiled. The image was flashing in his mind – this one he knew how to answer.

“That is thing that demon prince have,” he said. “When demon become demon prince, they give this thing to them.”

*Can you steal one?*

“No, no. Only when you become demon prince, climb up high, then they give. Only way.”

The voice in his head sighed. Groxor didn’t understand what the fixation was – the position of demon prince was so very many ranks above him, that he had never once harboured any ambition to reach there.

*Would you like me to help you become a demon prince, Groxor?*
