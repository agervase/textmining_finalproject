The little girl whimpered again as the Long Legs Man took her out of the trunk and tossed her over his shoulder. As she struggled, she wondered if her parents would come looking for her.

They never believed her stories about him. They always said that the Long Legs Man was nothing to be scared of, that he was supposed to help her. That was what being a counsellor meant, that he helped boys and girls like her. But the little girl had always been frightened by his leering eyes, nervous when he followed her home. She was especially terrified now. This didn't seem like something a good man would do.

As he carried her into his house, she noticed a dark form moving outside. She wondered if the Long Legs Man had friends.

He tied her to a chair. The ropes were too tight. They hurt her wrists. She tried to tell him, but the gag was too tight as well.

The Long Legs Man took off her gag, but she was too frightened to talk. He leaned in, and she could smell his minty breath. She closed her eyes.

The Thing saw its chance. Once the little girl could no longer see it, it enveloped the Long Legs Man. He gasped, fighting against the sudden liquid blackness surrounding him. It was no use. The more he struggled, the stronger the Thing appeared. It streamed into his nose, his ears, his mouth, choking him. It was inside him. The man fell to his knees.

When the little girl opened her eyes, the Long Legs Man was gone. She looked down, and her bonds were loosened. A dark warmth enveloped her and led her home. It placed her in bed and closed her eyes. As it slipped back under the bed, she thought she heard it say, "I missed you."
