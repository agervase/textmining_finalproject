[Part 1]

When they came, it was not nearly as one would expect; at least not what the average Joe, Jane, Tom, Dick, or Harry would have expected.  Aliens meant fantastically futuristic, didn’t it?  They were supposed to have arrived in spaceships descending from orbit and raining death upon us with technological supremacy.  They might have landed their ships and been humanoids upon emerging from their crafts, wielding laser guns, or something similar, and decimating us with that technology.  Perhaps they would have been more beast like, like something from a Geiger painting…right; charging forth in a beast-like frenzy? 

For all the world, back in early 2015—still very much a technological age for well over 90 percent of the Earth’s inhabitants—they had come sailing through the skies in what looked like ancient clippers, schooners, and similarly designed ships of wood.  Fantastic all right; as in what had resembled the dark peoples that might have made up Sauron’s army from The Lord of The Rings trilogy.  There were Orc-like creatures, and those with pointy ears and grey skin like evil Elves, and beserker men and women had come off those ships, washing forth upon our continents with sabres, swords, and bows, slaughtering those who’d gotten in the way.  Far worse were the Warlocks; men and women in flowing robes of varying black or red hues, depending on their bent for different schools of magic.  

Even with the common soldiers, their armors—we’d come to understand later—had been gifted with runic magic, protecting them as they butchered any careless enough to not run away, who thought glocks and shotguns would save them.  Of course, governments around the world ordered jets and attack helicopters on those ships, though their machine guns and missiles exploded harmlessly against lavender colored energy shields.  When that didn’t work, larger missile strikes from military bases were tried—again, having no effect on the spelled-ships.  It did take well over two years, but the Earth’s population had shrunk drastically with each passing month.  Of course, something strange had been realized by the dwindling population.  Magic of our own was still there, and much more present as 7 billion became 5 within the first year, and to what must be perhaps less than 1 billion now, though technology had all but ceased to function with destroyed satellites, power plants vaporized, and manufacturing plants amongst the first targets of the invaders.  We’re fighting back though, with our own magic, as best we can.  Our magic manifests differently though, from person to person.  While runes are woven with intricate hand gestures, and spells of power are worked when invoking the right words from our enemy, ours manifests quite differently.
