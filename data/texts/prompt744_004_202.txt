"What the hell does this peice of crap do?"

"I don't actually know... But I summoned it with all the power I have!", beamed the rabbit sized god.

"I'm going into mortal combat against these super-people and you give this... This... Do you hate me that much?"

"Actually, I like you a lot. You're very lucky!"

I smack my head against this musket thing in frustration, and suddenly a gauge popped up. It looks like some sort of roulette wheel, although I could not read the glyphs on it.

Out of instinct you pointed the musket at the rabbit god and pulled the trigger, the gauge spun and stopped at a glyph with a circle and a square, suddenly the square shifted into the circle and at the same time the rabbit god faded out of existence.

"What the fuck? Where did you go?"

No answer.

Great the god ditched him, I don't even know the way to the arena.

I wandered around, trying to find some sort of directions. The realm of the gods seem to resemble the town where he was... Wait I recognize this place, it's my hometown! Maybe the gods put me here so I know where to go, sure nice of them to do that! Ok now, where could the arena be? I furrowed my brows to remember the town's layout. Ah! I could try the ice hockey arena.

As I made my way over, I noticed people staring at me and lowering their eyes. Must be pitying my bad luck to be chosen to do this.

Arriving at the arena, I found it full of activity; there were people practicing martial arts, some appear to be performing some sort of magic spell, and right at the entrance was a man in centurion gear looking fully the part of an entrance guard.

I approached the guard and asked where contestants should go to register.

He replied, "What are you talking about, god of luck? Why are you disguised as a human?"
