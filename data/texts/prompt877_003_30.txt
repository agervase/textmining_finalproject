He watches as the car drives away. One, two, three... four? Four heads. Good. This weekend, then.

It's simple, really. Summer is a time of vacations for most families, and it's a time of hard work for him. *Yessiree, hard work it is, stealing folks' hard-earned possessions...*

A couple days later and he's on site. Tools? Ready. Bag? Empty. Not for long, though. The window is opened just... like... *that* and he's in. It's like they make it easy for him on purpose.

Ouch. He's older than he thinks, and flipping his somewhat overweight body over the windowsill strains something. No matter, he'll be out in a split second and off to his chiropractor. (Guy works for cheap, too! Can't be wasting money when you don't have health benefits. Seriously, kids, don't grow up to be a burglar.)

He turns around to grab his bag, which is still sitting outside of the window, and is met with an iron curtain. *Déjà vu*, he thinks. At least he didn't park his car in Poland this time. 

*"Laaaadies and gentlemen! Player two has entered the game!"*

Dammit, now he needs to see his [otolaryngologist](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0ahUKEwiZnZeosMTPAhUDwmMKHZLzArwQFggmMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nchearingloss.org%2Fotolary.htm&usg=AFQjCNGhdNVlvwL3gin2m1n9wjWEXr4Ezg&sig2=FEY1t-tjPvAqko4aT9YO_Q), too. 

The sound of a couple of explosions come from upstairs, and he realizes they sound like firecrackers. *Pretty sure that's a municipal bylaw violation*.

He sits down and takes a long breath. This is all fairly confusing - well, the firecrackers and the iron curtain don't make much sense, true, but it's mostly his back pain. Since when was it this easy to break something? *It's time to retire*, he thinks, *let the kids take care of me*. 

A minute later - or is it an hour? he's not paying much attention - a man, wearing a rather revealing skintight suit and an entirely green mask, is standing in front of him.

"Hello? Hello? You doing all right there?"

He groans. "Give me a hand?"

"Sure, but we're going to have to fight to the death after," the man says, bending down. "I didn't set up all this for nothing, you know?"

"All right, all right, don't get your trousers all bunched up." A couple wheezes later, and the burglar is upright, albeit resting mostly with his weight supported by the wall. "So who the hell are ya?"

"I am Mega-Ultra-Super-Fighter-Man! You can call me Timothy for short."

The burglar's eyes bulge. "Tim? Is that you, man?"

Timothy takes off the mask, which had a conspicuous lack of eye holes. "Oh, hey Jerry. How's it going? How's the job?"
