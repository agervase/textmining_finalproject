It was another day in the city. Walking to work like I usually do hoping no one bothers me. I walk past a few beggers and they ask me for some spare change. I tell them to f off and stop doing drugs.

"Stupid junkies" I think to myself.

Then, out no where, I stop walking. I just stare ahead for a good 10 seconds. My thoughts start to change, my emotions get strong out of nowhere. I feel bad for the homeless man, and I suddenly noticed that I'm giving them 10 bucks and apologizing for my earlier behavior.  I can't stop myself from doing so. I walk back to the spot I froze at and was able to control myself again. 

"What the hell?" I mutter. 

I just look back, bewildered, I see the homeless man is estatic and has a huge smile on his face while mouthing the words, thank you. 

I rush to work and head straight to the bathroom and splash some cold water on my face.  

As I look up I see a person, I jump a little. I didn't hear anyone come in.

This person is just smiling at me, he has a sort of glow to him an innocent feeling of the sort, nothing that I feel around the  people of the city.

"Hey, that was nice of you to give that man money. With those $10 he'll get a job and will become a public speaker encouraging hundreds of kids to stay off the streets and drugs." He says.

I just stare at him. 

"That wasn't me, I hate the homeless they're a waste of space and just want money for their damn vices."

"Oh, man, that's some harsh stuff there buddy. It was you though, well I had something to do with it but all I did was tap into the little bit of good you have and the rest was you." 

I just scoff.

"You're probably on something too" 

He smiles. 

"No I'm an angel, I don't do drugs and I'm here to help you."
