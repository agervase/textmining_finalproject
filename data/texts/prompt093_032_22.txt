Coughing, you wave your hand in front of your face, trying to clear away the smoke.  You blink frantically, trying to stop the burning sensation from the smoke in your eyes.

As your vision clears, the creature in front of you becomes more clear.  Your first impulse is that it's a sickly child, but the longer you look, the more confused you are.

Yes, the creature in front of you is short, but it's more than that.  Its eyes are huge, almost like a Manga come to life.  Its skin is greyish, and it's body is thin, impossibly thin.  You wonder how it can even stand upright with so little visible muscle mass.

As surprised as you are to see this little thing, you can tell it is terrified.  The huge eyes are even wider than they should be.  The creature looks like it's bravely fighting the urge to cower in the corner.  But, steeling itself, the creature begins to speak.

*"I has summoned you, demon.  Do my bidding, and I will you return.  Refuse, and you trapped within the circle be forever!"*  says the little creature, with a voice like a cartoon mouse.  It's clear that English isn't the creature's first language, but it's reasonably fluent.

Wondering about being trapped in the circle, you take a step forward and extend your hand toward the shimmering air over the circle on the ground.

This time, the creature loses its nerve. It does take a few hurried steps back, looking ready to run, but when your hand is stopped by the barrier, some of its confidence returns.

You touch the barrier, wondering if you look like a goofy mime.  Although you can't see it, there is clearly something there.  Closing your eyes, you feel around.  If you didn't know better, you'd swear it was a steel wall, cold to the touch, and absolutely solid.

*"Yes, yes.  Trapped!  Do what I say and you I will release."*  The creature explains.

*"Look, there must be some mistake, I'm not a demon, I'm a human,"* you try to explain.

*"Yes, human.  That is what said.  Human demon."*  The little thing seems to be growing in confidence now that the barrier does seem to be working.

*"No, you don't understand.  Demons are from hell.  Demons are big and red and scary.  I'm just a human,"* you try to reason with the little thing.  Something must have gone wrong in the magic it used on you.

*"Yes, hell,"* the creature nods in agreement.  *"Suffering?  Torture?  Inquality?"*

*"Well, yes, I suppose there's some of that, but it's not really _hell_.  Forget about that.  Look at me.  I'm not a demon!"*  As you say that, you look at yourself through the eyes of the creature who summoned you.  To it, you must appear huge and powerful.  Your skin is slightly tanned from that recent trip to Mexico, and while it's not red, even in mid-winter you're not as grey as the little thing in front of you.  You may not have horns or a tail, but it's pretty clear you're extremely intimidating, even with ruffled hair and your bad posture.

*"Ok, let's just put that to the side for the moment.  You say you summoned me and you can return me?  Why did you want me?  I don't, I mean... I'm not magical,"* you say, hoping that you won't be trapped forever by a creature who vastly overestimates your abilities

*"You Bahry Lahrsn are,"* the creature says, mangling your name.  *"You the legendary demon of sex are."*

*"Wait, what?  Demon of sex?  I'm no... I mean, I'm not a virgin, but I'm no sex demon,"* you try to explain.

*"No?"*  The creature consults the book in front of it, reading from some list.  *"Did three times penetrate goddess Anjla on night Prom?  Did up-hook Shrly and later same night Surah on eve of New Year?  Did digitally Dafnie in vehicle back on trip road car back?"*

You stand there in stunned silence.  Somehow your greatest sexual exploits, mild as they are, are written down in a book this creature is reading.  You cringe, thinking back about how you'd fooled around with Daphne Samuels in the back seat of a car on a road trip.  Her coat had been covering her waist, and you'd...  Well, at the time you thought you'd gotten away with it, but later on you learned that *everyone* in the car knew what was going on.

*"Look um... I... How do you know about that?"*  You demand, your voice a mix of anger and confusion.

The little creature closes the book and shows you the cover.  On it are some glyphs you don't recognize but the creature points to them.

*"Great demons of Eroth,"* it says, pointing to some glyphs.  Pointing at the next set of glyphs, it says: *"Volume 6."*

You stand there in silence for a while, thinking.  Apparently, you're Barry Larsen, legendary demon of sex, whose exploits are documented in graphic detail in a demon manual.  Might as well just accept it.

*"Ok, well.  I guess I'm a sex demon.  What is it you want?"*  You ask.

*"You me help.  Lovely Shrmu is!  Notice not she does me,"*  the creature laments.  *"Help me to sex her you will?  You must!"*

Over the next little while, you impart your meagre knowledge to the little thing.  It treats your words as if they were magic spells, rather than tidbits of advice.  Such arcane knowledge as "be confident" and "dress nicely" are treated as dark magic.  "Don't be clingy" is treated as a holy commandment.

Within a few hours, you run out of advice.  You wonder if it will be enough, but the creature looks as if you'd just revealed the inner workings of a secret cult.

Distracted by its plans, and trying to remember everything you've said, the creature opens up the spellbook.

*"Agreement you fulfilled.  Return you to hell now, I will,"* the little thing says, starting to wave its hands in an intricate pattern.

*"Wait, little guy,"* you say.  *"Look um... let me know how it goes, ok?  You can bring me back here, if you want."*

The creature looks at you and blinks.  Perhaps it's wondering if the demon is trying to trick it.  Without another word it snaps its hands out.

There's a flash of light, a bang, a puff of smoke, and when it clears you're standing in your living room.  That's when you realize the opportunity you missed.  If that book had your entire sex life in it, maybe it knew if Megan was ever going to stop playing hard to get.
