I’m jolted awake, groggy and stiff with a terrible kink in my neck. I hate riding the metro home from work. The dull red plastic seats are so uncomfortable; the train always lurches; and the most days the cars are crowded. I hate the ugly people. I hate the smelly people more. I often think if I could kill them, I would. Today, however, almost everyone seems to have gotten off before my stop. Confused but relieved I sit back and try to fall back asleep. 

“Hey Mister! Excuse me!”

“God Dammit! What the hell do you want?”, I mumble as I open my eyes to see a young boy standing in the aisle in front of me. The kid reminds me of my son. About five or six with brown hair and big eyes. He is wearing New Jersey Devils hockey t-shirt and is holding a something in his hand. 

“You wanna hear me play my harmonica?”, he asks in an innocent tone. I roll my eyes slightly. This is the same kind of crap my kids always pull. 

“Daddy! Daddy! Look at the picture I drew!” My son draws lots of pictures at school, but they always look awful. I don’t think he can even color in the lines. I cannot believe that the school he goes to claims to be best in the state if they do not even teach how to color in the lines. I wish my lawyer had managed to get his mother to take full custody, but now I have to deal with him every other weekend. 

“No kid.”, I reply to the boy on the train. “Go find your parents or ask someone else.”

“Everyone else already tried to help me, but they got to their stop before I can finish my song.” He wines back.

“Look.” I tell him. “I don’t know you and I do not want to hear you play that thing. Just go find your parents.”

He wanders off. I sit back and wait for my stop.
