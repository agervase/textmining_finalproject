     The human boy, Jason, is getting dropped of at his school for another day of learning. He gives his mother a kiss on the cheek and exits the car. Socializing with his friends before his classes, he sees a significant decoration that the school has put up above the entrance doors:

"Homecoming Week" 

     It is his first homecoming and the pressure is high. Social tensions rise between the opposing sexes. And the skirmish to find an appropriate date to the ball has officially begun. 
     Jason does not want to go alone. After all, it's his first year in High School and the social consequences could last years. 
     As he opens his locker door, he looks around and makes eye contact with Natalie, an interesting prospect. But is it too soon? He wonders. To Jason, asking too soon could be as bad as asking too late. Nevertheless, he gets his books for his next class and approaches. The courtship has begun. 
    The body language between the two humans can be very telling. As he approaches, Jason broadens his shoulders and opens up his chest to project confidence, strength, and masculinity. Natalie initially shies away, focusing on her locker, but eventually, she cannot feign her ignorance of the approach, due to the vocal communication coming from Jason. 
     From an observer's perspective, the conversation is quick. But to the two humans, is seems to last a life time. Pores of sweat start to open up on Jason's forehead, as he has begun to develop the fear of being rejected. Not only that, but the stakes are high, for Natalie is high value prospect. 
     After an awkward moment of silence, Natalie agrees to the courtship. Natalie shows more signs of approval and leaves as the bell has just rung, while Jason, turns around, and with difficulty,  tries to hide his erection behind his books. The two separate. The courtship has concluded.
