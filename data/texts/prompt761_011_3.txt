{GET TO SAFETY!}

The words blared across my vision.  “This is weird,” I thought.  I was used to the words in my vision, but usually they were only some mundane reminder like “go to work” or something.  The size and conviction of the text was generally much … kinder as well.  Just enough to tell the dimwit whose vision it blocked *“hey drekhead, do the thing!”*

I began to sit up at this point and told the localized apartment AI, Robi, to lighten the window.  I could now see there was something odd outside -- that sky was not the usual muted purple & blue color I was so used to.  It was … red?  Not just any red, either: it was the deep crimson color which we humans typically associate with blood.  As I went back to the bedroom to wake up Tara -- my girlfriend of 3 years and soon to be wife (okay fine, I hadn’t actually asked yet, but I had the ring!) -- to get her to take a look, alarms began to blare.  The automatic shutters typically designed for dust storms closed behind the windows with authority.

At this point, Tara was already awake, visibly and audibly confused.  As I was rushing to grab clothing for myself I grabbed stuff for Tara as well.  It was too loud to hear it myself, but I guess Tara must have asked Robi the time: “It is currently 0442 in Earth time; would you like Venusian time as well, Tara?”  As our AI finished, I rushed out of the closet I had been in and threw Tara’s clothing, whatever it was, onto the bed next to her.

“Hey Robi,” I said, “what’s going on?”

“I’m not entirely sure, Khlyen.  Would you like for me to project the view from your office?”

“YES!,” I practically yell at him as if an AI could detect my mixture of confusion, fear, annoyance, and grogginess.  After an extremely long 2 minutes, sirens still blaring and text still in my vision, he comes back with a response: “It seems I cannot connect to any of the cameras set up on the Cameron Sub-Orbital station.  Shall I attempt a connection to FormaVen Orbital?”

“If you have to ask, just do it already, dammit!”

...

“Feed is coming up on your holoscreen now.”

Although Tara was still in bed, albeit now sitting up with nothing to be imagined, she immediately jumped and rushed to put the clothing I had thrown toward her on.  The scene from FV Orbital confirmed the message still in my vision screaming at me.  This … storm … this … thing … had it all.  Lightning, ultra-high-speed winds, dust, with temperatures low enough to flash-freeze anything organic.

Wait, freeze?  No, that’s not right.  That can’t be right.  The outside temperatures were still supposed to be fluctuating between 500 and 550 Kelvin.   The terraforming process and recent installation of the sunshield was cooling the planet down, yes, but there’s no way those readings were correct.
