Life is all about the **pros** and **cons**

&nbsp;

The pro: I get to wear my Spiderman pajamas, and no one calls me a man-child.

The con: My dating pool is pretty narrow. Guess girls don't want to go for the pedophile look.


Well, it's not that bad of a trade-off. *I'll take what I can get.*

I'm alright with being alone. You start being okay with a lot once you're used to it.

I've had to run away from everyone and everything I ever knew. 

Not because I wanted to. I had to. 

Best friends? Childhood friends? High-school friends? 

Jokes on you, I haven't even been to High school.

My parents were amazing. Bless their souls.

Even though they knew what I was, they loved me for who I am.

They bought a home just for me and would visit all the time.

I was sent 'abroad' to 'study' is the story they went with.

Hilarious, everyone thinks I'm the sick son. My parents gave me everything, but I never visit.

I never go to family events. I don't care about my relatives.

Tears rolled down my face.

They didn't get it, and I didn't blame them. 

It's not like I didn't want to go to their funeral.

I didn't choose to abandon them. God, what I wouldn't give to see their faces again.

To tell the world how great they are. 

To tell the world, it's not their fault that I still look thirteen. 

Out of everyone I've ever known, their strength is what kept me going.

But that would freak people out. I didn't want to ruin their funeral. 

Screw it let's go for a walk; I'm done crying in my apartment.

They were gone now. And I had to carry on, my parents would have wanted that.

On the upside, I'm glad I live in 2018

I don't need to show my face to earn money.

God this was a pain a few decades ago. Thank god for freelancing now, or I'd be broke.

Guess no one wants to hire a 13-year old looking kid to be a writer.

But it didn't matter online. All that mattered were my words. And with that, I could make all the difference.

Good things happen when you practice something for 20 years straight. You get good at it.

It wasn't like no one ever saw my face. They just didn't care.

I was making them money through my writing, and they were okay with it.

The 'phantom author' is what they called me. Cute.

But I wasn't the only 'anonymous' author out there. I had competition.

It would be generous to call it that. There was only one other person.

And we've been going head to head for the last 20 years. I had respect.

I didn't hate competition; it made be better.

And for the first time, I was supposed to meet that person. 

So I walked on ahead to our meeting spot, wiping the tears from my face.

I stood and waited for a good 15 minutes; the suspense is killing me.

A little girl walked by, about my age. It was pretty late; she must've been out with her parents for a walk.

I asked here, 'do you need help looking for your mom?'

She replied casually, 'No I'm waiting for someone.'

Wait...It can't be.

So we both waited. The time for our meeting came.

This was eerie. 

The girl looked at me and blurted out the words that I was afraid to hear, 'You're phantom aren't you?'

Jesus Christ.

I replied yea.

'I knew it,' she cheered.

What's going on, is this a sick joke?

Am I getting punked?

'Well you must be prodigy right, you're so young. I love your stories,' I replied trying to play off the situation.

Because let's face the chances of this happening, bonkers.

'Yea sure, same goes for you too,' she said with a grin.

Something was up, we conversed for a while, and she was keeping up. 

Not just with current topics. But old topics....not anything a 13-year-old should know.

I had a feeling in my gut I was going to learn something tonight that wasn't going to sit well. 

This is goddamn foreshadowing on steroids.

And then she went out and said it. 

It's quite fascinating that the human brain can process so much information. It can anticipate most scenarios.

But emotions can still keep you frozen.

'How long have you been thirteen?' she asked with a smug face.

'What do you mean?' me trying my best act surprised.

She looked impatient. 

She pulled out something from her little purse. An Id. 

The second she pulled it out, my heart skipped a beat. I sat down on the bench; this couldn't be happening. 

Not because of what I'd see on it, but because of the color.

I knew that color very well.

On my desk, at home, there's a similar one there. I've had it there for 30 years.

'Alright, I don't know what sick joke you're playing here, but I've had enough,' while shrugged it off and started walking away.

'I know who you are,' she blurted out, hands crossed.

'There are more of us, we were all born in the leap year, and we've been watching you. Your parents didn't want to talk to us,' she sighed with a bit of sadness.

'We've been trailing you, well dusting has. A hacker can do quite a lot when he has the time to learn every piece of tech known to man. And guess what, he's not legal enough to buy alcohol yet', she smirked.

I looked up at the sky; God let this end well.
