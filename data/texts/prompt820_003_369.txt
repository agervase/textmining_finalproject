For all the pomp and circumstance surrounding this place, you'd think they'd keep it less... Dreary. Old fashioned candelabras and their stalactites of wax? Really? Could they have at least dusted first? Sniffling and sneezing do not a mighty warrior make.

We follow the dull clang of the bell's order to line up. We, a group numbering half a dozen men and women resembling Greek statues in their perfections and...
Me. On a good day I resemble a well loved arm chair-- short and squishy. I wouldn't say I'm bad looking. I just probably wouldn't keep me in the front parlor of a mansion if you catch my drift. But looks mean nothing according to the Committee. So here I am.

*Psst. Hey.* 

This is a big day, who would be goofing off?

*Hey.*

I glance to my left.

*Oh, what a relief! Someone is listening!*

There's no one to my left. Just another faded moldy tapestry. I try to focus again on the cloaked figure before us droning on with his congratulatory speech.

*Come here!* 

When they said our weapon would call to us, they didn't exactly say you'd start hearing voices. That, uh... Seems like pertinent information right now. 

*No, hey! Wait, actually! Yeah, that's how it's supposed to go, right? You wait until he says so. Oh! This is so exciting. No one's heard me in hundreds of years! I'm back here!*

So it seems I've been chosen already. No going to lie, being first is pretty exciting.

The bell clangs once more. We fall out of line one by one. The Adonis at the front of the line wanders around for what feels like a decade before making a beeline to Zeus' Bolt. He would. The Amazonian woman after him walks around for even longer before a spear of bones chooses her. My classmates are chosen, each weapon more ferocious looking than the last It takes hours. The whole time the voice to my left won't stop talking. 

*Still here, yup! Just pull the curtain back! Oh, I probably look terrible. Don't hold that against me, please!* 

Finally my turn. 

*Yay!*

I take a fistful of tapestry and a deep breath before pulling back to see a rather plain looking golden bow and a quiver.

*I am Cupid's Bow and I'm looking forward to working with you!*
