I knew something was wrong the second I came home and saw Mom and Pop sitting on their giant orbs, their bodies pulsing nervously with light. They summoned a much smaller orb and it floated over to my side.

"Have a seat son."

I sat, reluctantly. "Mom, Pop, what's the matter?" I asked.

Pop sighed and it carried across the silvery hall like a great gust of wind. They drew closer to me. They towered over me now and I thought so incredible that I would one day grow to be that size... and color... and form.

"Son." He hesitated and then looked at Ma. 

"Dear, this will be hard to hear. You are... you are a human."

"What? What does that mean? What are you saying?" My heart started racing. I had always felt I was different in some manner. I always had a faint feeling of detachment, but everyone was so accepting and the world so beautiful that it always remained just a silly suspicion. 

"We're not the Johnsons. The idea was constructed to fit the conceptual models built into your brain."

"But- but Ma..."

"I also have no definitive gender. It was a role I assumed because... because, for lack of better human terminology, I love you Matthew."

"We love you Matthew. We do."

"So, I'm adopted?"

"Yes." 

I let this sink in. I wiped a tear from my cheek and sniffled. They were at least as sad as I was but they showed it more through pulses of light.

"I- I guess I always kind of knew." I sniffled again and then looked far up at them. "Why are you telling me now?"

They looked at each other, and they pulsed even sadder.

"We have to give you up for a while."

"What? Why? To where?" More tears crept down my face.

"When we adopted you, it was under an agreement of, what your world would call, joint custody."

My words fell out between sniffles now. "You're... giving... giving me... up?"

"We have to Matthew. We of course would give anything not to."

"To... to... who?"

"Let's call them the Smiths."

"They're dark gods."

"Dark... gods?" I looked at them pleadingly. "You can't do this!"

They sat and pulsed and didn't speak. I wiped some more tears and let the sniffling subside.

"What happened to my real parents?"

"Oh I don't think-"

"I don't think it's best to tell you-"

"I want to know. I have to know."

"They gave you up for... gifts in return."

"What gifts?" I asked coldly.

My... step-beings paused. 

"Tell me."

"Your mother was queen of her prom."

"What does that mean? She was once very powerful?"

"At a dance."

The words stung. They stung more than the rest of the miserable news. "And my father?"

"You're father asked for an ability, when he was your mother's age as well."

"Yes?"

"He can see through things."

"Agh! I hate you! I hate you all! You're all horrible!" I slid off the orb and ran all the way to my personal realm. I sealed it closed and stayed there and thought about it all and what would happen. 'At least', I thought, 'the dark gods don't seem all that bad now.'
