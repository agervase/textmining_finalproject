I hated everything about growing up. From a young age, I hated the agony of losing teeth and waiting as they grew back over the course of months. I hated the repeated sicknesses I would easily catch on to such as the flu, or worse…the chicken pox. As I grew older, I hated the sudden but gradual changes that happened with my appearance: my breast size increased, my voice solidified. Body hair and odor became my greatest embarrassment and I had no one to help me solve my “problems.” The thing I hated most about growing up was the fact that I was the only one undergoing these configurations. No one could relate to the problems I had because everyone was perfect. I am a natural. I am the only natural to be alive right now and being so has put me at a disadvantage to the rest of the population.

Everyone in Canayt is genetically engineered to be in the most suitable human body that can maintain life for the maximum amount of years with ease. Nobody knows what a cough or a sneeze is, and they often get frightened at the sounds that I am able to create from my body. The Elders often look at me and laugh at the fact that I sound like a broken engine. 

As a girl, it’s so hard for me not to compare myself to all the other beautiful women around me. They never have to deal with body hair and are born with perfect teeth and hair.

The worst is when I am at school. Apparently, no one understands the concept of struggle. Everyone completes their assignments with ease and everyone has a journey of success. Everyone is aiding in the advancement of society, except for me. I use a calculator for all my assignments, and am always behind the rest of the class. 

No one understands me.

No one. 

And for this, I have decided to return to my frozen state, because maybe I can wake up at a time that is right for me. Maybe.
