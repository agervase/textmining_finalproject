This winter's somehow been the harshest I've seen yet. Usually I'd be spending my time by a fire, hoping to have something warm to toss down my throat before I make rounds.

But no, this time was different.

He told me that people used to say, "The grass is always greener on the other side." Well, right now I'm on the other side and it doesn't seem very green to me. After everything we've been through it almost makes me feel sorry for 'em. Almost.

I knew I should have had backup before I went out on patrol. I never listen to him and it always seems to bite me in the ass. Now here I am, tied up in some shack like before, only this time my ears are ringing and my head is pounding. Probably some old garage in the middle of a settlement. Even now it takes my eyes some time to adjust in the dark, but I can still make out shapes. Honestly the place reminds me of the shit that happened with David. Fuck that guy.

&#x200B;

I can hear footsteps outside. There's a lot of talking, too, but there's just one voice. Whoever this guy is, he must be some sort of kook. The bindings on my hands and feet aren't exactly tight - I think he tied me up with duct tape. Typical. The room is only filled with a faint light that grows a bit as a door in the southern wall opens. Yep, this is definitely a garage. The door continues to open, pouring light into the open room. Boxes of junk and shelves are littered everywhere. 

&#x200B;

Through the doorway a man enters, and immediately I go back to all the shit that happened in Lincoln. This guy looks almost exactly like that crazy fuck. "Well now," he says in a scratchy voice, walking towards me with some sort of machete in-hand. "Looks like I caught a mighty fine prize this evenin', wouldn't you say?" The burly man sports a series of facial scars and smells like he's never known what bathing is. As he crawls closer, he brings up the machete to my legs, running it along my inner thigh. "Oh, we gon' have some fun tonight, just you and me. We'll play for a bit and then we's can eat!" The disgusting man lets out a huge belly laugh. "Well, I'll be eating, anyways."

&#x200B;

While this idiot is enjoying his small monologue, he's not been paying any attention to me cutting at the worn-out tape he used to bind my hands. It always helps to keep a blade tucked into your waistband - he taught me that. I catch myself chuckling as I finish cutting the tape. Mister Big Boy notices, and becomes distraught. "Hey, what're you giggling about, little lady? Are you excited for the play date, too," the man stands up tall, pointing the machete in my face.

&#x200B;

I grip the blade in my right hand while shifting my feet a bit to loosen the tape around my ankles. "No," I reply, barely hiding the excitement in my voice. "I'm just thinking about how stupid you are, and how after tonight you'll only exist in the story I'm gonna tell Joel when I get back."
