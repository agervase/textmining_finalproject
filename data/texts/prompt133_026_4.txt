Sure, life is full of many depravities that offer some relief from the steady crawl toward death. Why do you think cigarettes, sky diving, and thrills in general are so thrilling? They launch you toward death. But they suddenly lose their appeal when you can never get any closer to death. 

A couple hundred years passed before I made the realization that, like others, my mind was a vast place waiting to be explored. After you've explored every scene this world has to offer, the only unexplored scene is inside your own head.

50 years passed like a blink the last time I sat in meditation. Goddamn did that first bite of ice cream taste good after that long. 

Reality fundamentally changes when you've become the most practiced meditator in human history. Time dilates and constricts on a whim. Concepts sprawl out in front of you plainly; the nuances of reality become mundane yet the intricacies give you unbridled joy that is unwavering. 

Death is a concept himself. Calling him a he is a bit of a misnomer considering 'he' is borderline omnipotent. In fact, Death is exactly half-omnipotent. Responsible for the cessation of every miniscule life, from the death of a single cell in your body to the death of a planet, Death is very busy.

I used to resent Death for being so petty, because surely eternal life is a curse. But millennia have shaped me into the Appreciator; the sole proponent of Death; Deaths cheerleader. Without Death, Life proceeds unbridled. Cancer, overpopulation, and resource depletion, all Life's doing. Death is an underappreciated entitety and I've devoted thousands of years to promoting death. 

The Buddha and Confucius are a few of my pupils. Their teachings attempt to enlighten, to teach peace and balance; harmony is achieved when we develop a healthy appreciation for life but come to terms with the fact that life is a steady crawl toward death. Life begets death and fear of death creates widespread disharmony. 

Death is inevitable; well, for most.
