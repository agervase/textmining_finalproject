The shudders of death, like all brave, hard, harrowing experience, ebbed away from Alex's mind. The pooling of blood, the dimming of the sky and the last desperate gasps all receded. As she stood there she tried to recall it, hold onto those last memories of life. But they became veiled far more quickly than she had thought.

And Alex saw, in the middle of the vastness of the afterlife, dim and grey at first but clearer and clearer with each passing moment sat millions of faces. There were a sea of them, almost evenly spaced, all stretched on a carpet of perfect grass under a grey sky. They were all sitting, standing, laying, reclining. Every so often someone would shift position, stretching or moving, but not a single one got up. Alex was the only one standing.

And suddenly, without warning she heard a voice, vaguely familiar.

"Alex?" it called across the moving, shifting sea of people. "Alex! Alex! We have been waiting for you!"

&#x200B;

Alex searched through the dim foggy grey memories, shifting the voice, comparing it. She turned her head from side to side searching and she saw, in the distance a woman standing, a thin, familiar outline.

Another voice called, this time a Man's voice and she saw him rise to his feet and join the woman. "Alex!"

And then she remembered, and a wave of familiarity washed over her.

"Mom? Dad?!" she cried, and she began to step over the people waiting on the grass, jumping over them or stepping around them. Her movement through the crowd barely registered on their faces. Some lazily lolled aside but most she simply had to navigate around.

Her parents folded her into their arms, strong and sweet, and smelling of home and childhood and memory.

"Alex, we've waited so long for you to show up here, and we have missed you with every single piece of our hearts. But Alex, we have loved these years, too, because each year here for us was a year of joy and life and the promise of living for you. We would have been content to wait here in eternity for you if it meant you could live forever. But we have waited for you, too. And you will also learn to love these waiting years."

&#x200B;

And just like that her parents gently released her from their arms and walked off farther and farther into the moving sea of people, until they were so far in the distance they were tiny dots, and then nothing. And Alex sat down in the grass where they had been and began to wait.
