First rule of the Hiest: Leave the money in the Teller's Registers. That was the first thing my grandfather taught me, hoping I'd take up after him unlike his Daughter who decided she wanted to be Legitimate... Fucking lot good that did her. He was sitting for another forty years behind bars, might die back there if his Bail isn't paid off and it'd be a shame if his fortune just completely vanished, or worse, ended up in another off-seas bank he had it stored in.

That bit of advice might actually save my life right now, thanks Gramps.  

**"What's so funny?"** The masked man shotgun in my face 'asks'. I have to admit, I'm kinda jealous of the equipment they got. A police radio they had playing in the center of the lobby so they'd know when the police arrive, voice recorders that would play pre-determined lines so no one could claim they knew how they sounded, even tungsten rounds for the two bank guards wearing ballistic vests. But I beat them to the Vault already, and the money in the bank ain't squat to what I'm going to get by the time I hand over the last bill.  
"Sorry, I was just thinking of this really catchy tune, remix of one of those modern songs."  
**"Don't act dumb."** Oh, I'm not. I very much like my face as it is.  
These guys weren't interested in the vault, they were smart about it: Come in, make some noise in a small town bank, rob the tellers, bail. Sure, it wasn't going to make them *THE BIG BUCKS* but this was about Funds for something else, not retirement.  

**"Two Minutes."** He said over the police radio playing from a smartphone in the middle of the crowd. The heisters were finished getting the money from the tellers, slung them over their shoulders, and all by one left to get their escape vehicle ready. The last guy was making sure the rest of us stayed down. Ten seconds later, a carhorn, and he left. The vehicle would merge into traffic, and be gone. Everyone here would be questioned but there was no evidence except the radio, which they got from a pawn shop. That lead wouldn't go anywhere though.

What would stumble all of the detectives though was the Vault was empty, but no one saw the perps go in there. Of course, by that time, I already offloaded it. And sure, I'd have to pay Gramp's bond slowly, and he wasn't happy to know he'd have to spend another ten years in the slammer, but after that he'll go to his bank, sign off the money in my name, and then he can die admiring his life's work.

That's what he wants, and that's what I'm gonna give him.
