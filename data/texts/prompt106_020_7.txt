[PART 1]

Casey Richards had never seen something so brutal in her life. Granted, at that point she only had five years of living under her metaphorical belt, even less than that when you considered her first coherent memory was from the tender age of three. So two years of recognizing herself as Casey, and she had already laid witnesses to a suicide. Truly this girl was going to be grow up to be a paragon of mental stability. 

Just a moment ago a man fell from the sky, crashing into the broken concrete with all the grace of uncooked ramen. The man - let's call him Vinny Anyvlogger - had his blood and shattered bones littering the alleyway, his dying nervous system sending what was left of his muscular system into weak spasming. Casey had a feeling he was hurting a little less then when she had skinned her knee. She didn't hear Vinny crying, so he had to be in better shape, right?

"Come on, Vinny, you didn't have to do this..."

Casey blinked a few times. Who was that just now? It didn't sound like anyone she knew, and she knew a lot of people! Her mommy, her daddy, Uncle Stone, Christina from down the street, Blind Mister Taylor... this person didn't sound like any of them. She turned around to get a better look at the man - she knew it was a man because they sounded a little like her daddy, but not close enough to what her daddy sounded like to be him.

He was really big, like most grownups were, but he was wearing this flowing black thing that didn't let Casey see any of his skin. She did get to see a little of his face under the hood, but not much because of the shadows it cast. Casey wondered how he could see with so much shade over his eyes, but then again she knew how much looking at the sun could hurt. 

The Man hadn't noticed the girl yet, fully focused on the twitching form of Vinny Anyvlogger. He knelt down next to the broken body, shaking his head.

"H-hey...it's you..."

"It's me." The Man's shoulders lowered a bit when he heard Vinny speak. "No need to strain yourself anymore, Vinny. I've come to take you away," The Man said. He reached out with one of his arms, but Vinny shook his head.

"I-I know. I...wanted to see you, one last time."

The Man remained silently staring at Vinny, his expression obscured by the hood on his head. His arm was hanging stiffly in the air between the two.

"I know, I've tried to see you so many times over the years but...I wanted to hear you...sing... again." The Man sagged further at this. "I...would get it...if you didn't want to. But I..."

The Man made that sound the Librarian liked to make when Casey's cubbymates got too loud in the library, only it was a lot more comforting than how Miss Dayke did it. "Alright," The Man said. "One last lullaby."

*Out on the road there are fireflies circling*

*Deep in the woods, where the lost souls hide*

*Over the hill there are men returning*

*Trying to find some peace of mind*

*Sleep my child*

Casey had heard these kinds of songs before at bedtimes, when her daddy would tuck her in at night. She didn't see any blankets around the alleyway [what a weird place to take a nap, anyways], but she honestly found it hard to care about that anymore.

*Under the fog there are shadows moving*

*Don't be afraid, hold my hand*

*Into the dark, there are eyelids closing*

*Buried alive in the shifting sands*

*Sleep my child*

Vinny was crying now, his tears silently shuffling down his cheeks. If Casey had still been able to see past her own tears, she might have thought he really had gotten hurt badly. 

*Speak to me now and the world will crumble*

*Open a door and the moon will fall*

*All of your life, all your memories*

*Go to your dreams, forget it all*

*Sleep my child*

Vinny's eyes were closed. He was sleeping now. The Man took Vinny into his arms, and some sunlight reflected off of something nearby poked beneath his hood. His face looked like one of those Halloween decorations - 'skellingtons,' her daddy called them. As The Man and his skellington face slowly stood up, he finally noticed Casey standing there with tears in her eyes. "...wait here," The Man said, and vanished into thin air.

Casey kept staring at the spot The Man once stood. Even though she was cry, it felt... good. She'd never felt good about crying before, or had ever had her heart feeling all fluffy like this.

She needed to hear that song again.
