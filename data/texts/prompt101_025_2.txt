People. They look me in the eye as they drop off their unwanted baggage, because that's what emotions are: baggage. 

What started out as a selfish venture to feel something I didn't know existed turned into a charity for others. They got to dump all their garbage onto me: depression, anger, anxiety, fear… The list goes on. 

I'm the Garbage Woman, or so they call me. But oh how I long for the days where I was blissfully unaware of the plight of humanity. How I wish to be empty again before I knew what empty felt like. And I could do it, if emotions weren't like addictive drugs. I keep going back and back and back, all because I've tasted the intensity, the all encompassing loss of control when feeling. It's bad for me, all these negative emotions. I've turned cynical where I used to be sarcastic, I've become angry where I used to be cold. The little friends I did have all fled when I started hurtling insults as tears streamed down my face. But I just couldn't stop going back for more. Until today. 

As I reached into the box to get my next fix, something foreign filled my chest, something good. I seemed to double in size… No, I felt like I exploded out of my body. I had this urge to whistle and sing. I wanted to shower hugs onto everyone. 

As I walked down the street, marveling at the sincerity of my smile, my benefactor caught up to me. She tapped me on the shoulder and pointed at herself and my smile. She seemed so giddy! How could someone have so much happiness to spare, I wondered. 

I reached over to give her a hug, and she grabbed me with such gusto that I thought I would burst. She didn't talk, but continued to clap and laugh with a childlike twinkle in her eyes.

And I understood. She had an intellectual disability, but she radiated pure happiness, conscious that she had just given me a priceless gift. From that day on, she became my drug. She gave me what the world never could.
