Dear Journal,

As I’ve written to you before, I am hometown-famous for picking coins from the ground and inspecting them thoroughly. It was a childhood hobby that turned into an adult hobby. 

It started when my grandfather once told me that if I found a coin with a misprint, misspelling, or any imperfection that it would be worth a lot of money. I never found one but I enjoyed the process. 

Two days ago, I found a penny that was dated 2044. I flipped it over to find my face carved in it. I looked around with suspicion. 

What is going on? Have I watched too much Westworld? I feel like I am dreaming but I know, subjectively, this is reality. 

I plant the penny in my pocket. You know when you Google something very specific and doubt that even Google can give you results? That’s how I felt when I Googled my name followed with 2044. Many results with my name or the year but none with both together. 

While on the way home, I try to block out the world by listening loudly to LCD Soundsystem. In an anxious trance as I listen to the chorus of Us v. Them. I just want to be home and in my room. That’s my safe space. 

I walk the sidewalk quickly towards my building. Open the door. Close it behind me. Walk to the second floor. Open my door. Close my door. Turn on the light. As I turn around I hear the screams of a dozen people, “SURPRISE!!”

All of my friends are gathered in my kitchen with a huge poster of the coin with my face on it. Then Melissa says, “I bet you found one of the gag-coins we had made and strategically placed around your car door!”

I had forgotten my birthday was today. It was a nice thought but poorly executed. As I’ve written you so many times before J, I need to find new friends.
