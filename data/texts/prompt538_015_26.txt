I was ready. After the disaster of last year, where my soulmate had been just been *sleeping,* I realized it'd be in my hands to keep us in touch. I made a card, that I kept in my pocket at all times. it had my number and nothing else. When it happened, I'd grab the card, and let my soulmate see. Soon. Any month now... January passes, as does February, March, April, and May. worried? no. it could happen any day now, no one said it had to be at the beginning of the year. June, July, August, September. Alright, I'll admit, I'm getting anxious. I get cocky and forget the card. Never again, for once I was relieved when the switch didn't happen. October. I've heard of the switch never happening. of course, things like that only happen if the soulmate... dies. November. I've started crying myself to sleep. December. They're dead. I have no proof except my dark thoughts, and lack of a switch. December 17th. I hold a funeral for them. I draw what I think they look like and cry over it for hours. December 26th. I'm staring at the card. I've had it around for a full year, should i... no. I... I cant. I couldn't. December 31st. A small part of me says "any second now!" I want to believe I've already met them or something. But I haven't met anyone new in the past year. I live in a small town, how could I? I could hear the countdown from upstairs begin. 10. 9. I pull out my card. 7. 6. I sigh softly and throw it into the fireplace. 5. 4. I watch the card fall into the fire and get burned up by the flames, on the verge of tears. 3. 2. Suddenly, I'm at an amusement park. "HAPPY NEW YEAR!!" I hear. someone pulls me close and kisses my forehead. somehow I know it's my older brother. No, not mine. I'm in a line, laughing softly. My friend comments how New Years was the perfect time to go to this park, and what a genius I am for coming up with the idea. *No, not me*. Then I'm back downstairs. The cheerful, drunk chatter of my family is heard upstairs. The card has finished burning, providing no information to my soulmate. FML.
