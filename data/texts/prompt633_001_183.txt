The pile of clothes on the floor had grown to the point it was level with the bed. Normally this would have driven me crazy. I don't really know what it was about this switch. I just felt...comfortable. I'd been awake for a while, but was just browsing Reddit for a while. Then I noticed the time: 11:45. Going to be late again. I'm mostly muscle memory from this point. Grab my bag and wipe some deodorant on. Smell a few t-shirts in the pile until I find the least offensive one. Cursory tooth brushing. Run out the door to try to catch the bus that will get me to work by 12:10.

Work email pouring in. I could answer it now, but would be faster to do once I'm at the office. So play Pixel Dungeon as the bus lurches towards downtown. I've been in this body for over a month. Still nothing.

It's been a year since the switch. Still not in any rush to figure out this skill. Dude seems pretty damn mediocre from what I can tell. If you had told me a year ago this was happening and I would be okay with it, I wouldn't have believed you. Maybe I'm just learning to take things slow. Hey, maybe that's it. Maybe this is the most relaxed person in the world...nothing. Meh.

The mountain of porn this guy had accumulated was mind-boggling at first, 18 months ago, but now it all seemed stale and familiar. I'll yank it some other time. Fire up Steam.

...

The PM's really on my ass about getting this thing over to UAT. I said I'd have the controller module done ages ago, but even though it's straightforward, I always was just finding something else to do. Maybe just check Reddit one more time then get around to it. Man, I must be the world's worst procrastinator.
