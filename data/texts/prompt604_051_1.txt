***THE QUEEN IS DEAD.***

The words still rang in Damien's mind, even after the two weeks it took to prepare for the Succession Ceremony. It had been so sudden that nobody was even remotely prepared. He stared up at the palace. Within those walls he and his many brothers would claim their destiny.

The Queen had been an incredible ruler, steering the country through thick and thin, yet even she, chosen by the gods, had her flaws. There were many rumors as to why she took so many consorts and bore so many children. Some said she longed for a girl, and that only siring men was a curse placed on her by a baleful witch, others whispered that she bored easily and no man she was ever with kept her entertained for more than a week, and some said that she was spending all her free time courting any man who caught her eye. The truth of it didn't matter though. What did matter was that there were more than 100 young men, all having been raised with their respective fathers, all vying for the crown.

The army of Princes grew silent as the Royal Speaker cleared their throat.

## "THE NEXT RULER OF GENEVOS SHALL BE DECIDED IN A COMBAT TRIAL, IN WHICH ANY PRINCE WISHING TO MAKE CLAIM ON THE CROWN IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. THE QUEEN HAS LEFT HER DIVINE PATRONAGE TO THE PRINCES WHO ARE WILLING TO UNDERGO THIS TEST OF MIGHT. THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO PARTICIPATE MAY RETURN TO THEIR HOMES NOW. THE REST OF YOU WILL ORDER YOURSELVES FROM YOUNGEST TO OLDEST AND FOLLOW ME TO THE QUEEN'S PRAYER CHAMBER, WHERE YOU MAY CLAIM YOUR PATRON."

Damien sighed. He was the oldest Prince.

Hours had passed since that announcement and Damien could see that the sun began to kiss the horizon through the extravagant stained glass windows. Damien yawned. Shortly after that, the Prince who had been standing in front of him the entire time exited the prayer chambers, surrounded by a golden aura. Damien made eye contact with him, and instantly regretted doing so.  The Prince must have made a pact with Ra, god of the sun. Wondering how Ra was passed up more than 100 times and worrying about who would be left, Damien entered the prayer chamber.

The chamber was darker and cooler than the hall. It was also a simple room, with only smooth stone walls, a pillow for kneeling on and a soft shaft of light cascading onto the pillow. Damien knelt and began to pray. His soul was transported to the space where, presumably, all of his mother's divine patrons were before all of his half-brothers claimed them. He scanned the environment, looking for any sign of a powerful patron to claim. The panic set in after he realized that he was alone. He whipped his head around, desperately hoping he had missed something, when suddenly, his body went cold. He suddenly felt a presence behind him. He turned, and was greeted by a skeletal visage, framed by a ragged hood. He somehow knew exactly who he was looking at, and spoke its name.

"Death."

The temperature dropped even further than before and Damien shivered. 

"I-is there n-n-n-noone else here?"

Death did not respond.

Damien's worst fear had been realized: the younger Princes all claimed the most powerful patrons, and all he was left with was Death. He turned to leave. 

"**Stop.**"

Damien did not. He continued to walk, until he felt an ice-cold force turn him around to face Death. 

"**I may have been your mother's patron, but that does not entitle you to treat me with scorn, boy**"

"Well, what can you do for me then? I have to fight against over 100 other Princes with the backing of patrons far more powerful than you! I have no chance at the crown!"

The force pushed Damien closer to Death, and it spoke again.

"**You entered the prayer chamber with the intent to claim a patron. You know that leaving without one will mar your soul for eternity. It is true that I am the only patron left, yet that does not speak to my power.**" 

Damien sighed "Fine. What do you have to offer?"

Damien felt the cold force grip his heart, forcing it to stop beating in his chest. He felt all the warmth drain from his body, replaced with a cold numbness. He felt the skin around his eyes sink into his eyesockets. Damien prepared for death. Then, it stopped.

"**The binding is complete.**"

"What the hell did you do to me??" Damien demanded with what little strength he could muster.

"** You are now bound to me, and I have shortened your lifespan. You will die if at the end of the battle if you do not emerge victorious.**"

Before Damien could scream at Death for what it had done to him, he woke up in the prayer chamber. He stood up, now fully feeling how cold and numb he was. The full weight of what had just happened pressed into his mind. He turned around, and exited the chamber.

He had to win. His life was now on the line. Yet, Death had granted him no power. As his desperation rose, he began to feel something else. A strength that had not been there before. He then realized what exactly Death had given him. Damien had been gifted with desperation, and a new power had been born from it. He strode out into the battle hall, unarmed and entirely ready to take the throne for himself.

He would not lose. 

He had no choice.
