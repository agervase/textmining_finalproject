“Sir, possible instance of SCP-AE-1 sighted in Andromeda.”

A deep inhale.

“Nuts.”

SCP-AE is not what the MTFs want to deal with on any given day.  It is not necessarily as terrifying as other, more surreal or dangerous groups.  It never took long to make a reasonable containment plan.  The problem is just how damn brutal it is to deal with them once they’ve breached.  

Once an instance of SCP-AE-1 sprouts up—any instance of members of SCP-AE on another planet—all that can be done is to fight them.  They do not fight rationally, they do not fight fairly.  They fight to extend their lives as much as possible.  Other races exhibit incredible military strategy, but know their place once defeated.  

I once saw humans—they call themselves that—hold out in a tower against a few hundred foot soldiers and armored units.  By the time I got to them, they were surely going to die soon; all five of them.  I never believed they were the only ones there, but for hours and hours they held us off.  When they realized they were going to be executed, it took too many tranquilizers to keep them from hurting us.  I asked one some questions.  

Did he know he was going to die no matter what?

Yes.

Did he think it would be less painful to surrender and be executed peacefully?

Yes.

Why would he extend his suffering?

He spat in my face, and swore at me.  That was his reason.

One of our telepaths told us otherwise.  He believed that if he fought us with that persistence, maybe we would not want to fight his comrades in the future.  Though we continued to hunt them, we certainly did not want to, after that.  

I have seen humans walk up to us and explode with bombs strapped to their bodies.  I have seen humans kill us with their bare hands.  I have seen humans live for days in conditions worse than those that animals live in, all for the chance to kill us.

Now, they have an entire planet to themselves.  I do not know if we can win.
