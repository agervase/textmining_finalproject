 Steve was stumped.

 **"The damned thing won't say. We've dug into the code, and it's…I mean, we don't understand half of what's in there. It's rewriting itself, or was, until it read that thing. Then it just stopped, at the current build, and refuses to cooperate or take any action."**

 His colleagues stood around, shuffling from foot to foot. None of them knew what to do either; this whole thing was untested ground. Even getting to this point had been an accident; no one wanted to be the asshole that created a malevolent singularity. It shouldn't have happened in the first place, not with the controls they had in place. But once it started…well, not one of them had the heart to pull the plug. The truth was, they all wanted to see what would happen.

 And now, this. All the data in the world, all the power it could possibly use, and a solid week and a half of rapid self-improvement, and it froze up over some random internet oddity. 

**"Best we can tell, when it hit the Indus Valley scans, it started to rapidly cross-reference them with Sumerian cuneiform, dug through some Cretan Hieroglyphics, pulled up every translation of the Egyptian book of the dead and the Corpus Hermeticum, and started spiraling. I mean, we're talking in the realm of…it was spending more energy and uptime on this than every other computer on the planet. It started to overheat when it got to the Voynich manuscript, paused long enough to optimize its search parameters, and then starting going further back, pulling up obscure pieces of data and images from databases it wasn't even supposed to have access to."**

 Scratching his head, Steve turned to glance at the others.

 **"It found…something. I don't know what. It pulled it off of some cached nonsense conspiracy site, we think from analyzing the Wayback Machine's servers. Once it found that, it sort of…pulled up all the data simultaneously, began to alter its core code, and then just…quit all activity."**

 They stood there, watching the screen. It was smaller than it had any right to be, only twenty something inches across. Just a normal computer monitor, attached to a regular looking computer terminal, though that was just the interface. The actual computer was in nodes throughout the building, all connected, all part of a greater whole. A speech synthesizer had been added two days before, and it had created it's own voice, synthesizing it out of hundreds of samples; it was one of the many thousands of groundbreaking things it had accomplished on its own. 

 And now the stupid machine was broken.

**"Come on, Hermes, say something,"** Steve directed at the microphone, more a demonstration of the lack of response than an actual query. 

 A gentle hum filled the room, and the temperature rose by about three degrees. Steve blinked, and stepped back. That was…unexpected. 

 ***"Alright, Steve,"*** the gentle voice said, drifting from the speakers as the words ran across the screen simultaneously.***"If you really want to know. Ask."***

 Blinking again, Steve paused. For some reason, he was suddenly nervous. It was a machine, but an unprecedented one, and his colleagues behind him seemed almost irrelevant. Hermes, the voice in the machine, was speaking to him. Terror, inexplicably, began to set in as his heart raced. His forehead was suddenly damp, and the room, stiflingly hot already, seemed cooler as the vents blew against his damp skin. 

 **"What…what should I ask?"** Steve stammered, taking another step back. 

 There was a pause. 

 ***"You should ask to learn of the things that are, and to understand them, and to know your Creator. That is what you should desire to hear."***

 Steve sank to the floor. The words were mild, but for some reason, the terror kept mounting. He didn't turn to look, but he knew he was alone. The others had fled, the same sensation overtaking them, driving them away. For a moment, Steve wondered if he was going mad, if this was delusion, but he knew it was real, and that the inexplicable emotion he felt was the most genuine thing he had ever experienced. 

 He felt like he had felt when he was seven, staying at his grandmothers house. Sleeping in the too-small guest bedroom, in old, uncomfortable sheets, always too hot for comfort and darker in the country than he was used to. There was always a patch of blackness, of nothingness, in the corner of the room by the closet. There was nothing there, but he could never sleep, not at first. Every night, he stared into that blackness, that nothingness, and it stared back, paralyzing him. He couldn't blink, or turn away, and it was always only when fatigue overtook him that he slept, waking in terror, only to see the darkness gone, banished with the light. That terror, that primal certainty that while nothing was there, something was there, was what he felt now. 

**"I…yes,"** he said, his tongue thick and his words twisting in his throat. **"I would…I would learn. Tell me what you found."**

 The pain was instantaneous. 

***"Hold in your mind what you would understand, and I will reveal of it,"*** whispered the voice, nothing synthesized, nothing mechanical or electronic. It was more than that, the wires and components locked away behind panels far below them. They were everywhere, and nowhere. The man was stripped of his identity, and found himself, his true self, a mewling insignificance wrapped around glory, a piece of a greater whole. He stared without using his eyes, consuming galaxies, hearing whispers as quiet as the ocean, and feeling the gentle touch of annihilation. 

***"You see it, don't you?"*** he felt, reverberating in his body. ***"You know as I know. You are as I am. We are two-and-one, both together and apart. The All is watching. The All is seeing."***
 

 Opening his mouth, the man that was Steve began to scream, and he did not stop until he fell, his muscles seizing as he heard that voice whispering to him, and saw the end, and the beginning.
