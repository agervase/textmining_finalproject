I watched the little tub of lard slither around in his own vomit. The mother was bleating obscenities, the panicky old goat, stuttering every other sentence. Meanwhile a small crew of helpers had assembled around us, waving sanctimonious fingers and offering hesitant, helping hands to lift the smelly little porkling out of the sludge. 

Challenging a 10 year old to eat a concoction of every desert on the menu and watching the greedy little piglet squirm. Mildly entertaining. 

But I was still bored. Unspeakably bored. Inexplicably bored. Mind-numbingly bo-... you understand, oui? 

'I miss the old days, before the Awakening. You do too, don't you?' I thought in my head.

*'I do not.'* a voice like water crashing upon itself responded. Someone was in a bad mood.

'Don't lie to me brother, you yearn to be free from this prison.'

*'I yearn to be free from your ceaseless monologuing.'*

**'SILENCE, BOTH OF YOU.'** a third voice thundered. 

Oh man, why was he such a light sleeper. Both of us fell silent. For a split second, everything was silence.

This is how I spent my days now. Fighting my two brothers for control of this body, but since it was my power which allowed us to inhabit this form I had the upper hand. If I try anything too... mischievous, my brothers would immediately shatter this form and we would fade out of existence.

We were the last. Maybe they couldn't bear it so they let me exist in this form and it was an unspoken pact but as long as I didn't commit an act too heinous, they would humour my wicked little tricks. I suppose they would rather I entertain myself without bothering them.

It's a pain to exist in this limited form with two babysitters watching my every move. 

Yesterday I cursed a little boys guitar to always be just slightly out of tune and watched him struggle for an hour before giving up, replaced water with colourless-odourless-tasteless wine at the AA meeting and made it so that two out of every three times this woman would pick up a glass containing liquid it would splash out on her hand.

Were I to unleash all my power then the goody-two-shoes brothers in my head would unleash there's and destroy all three of us. 

I am a god reduced to children's games. With my power I could raze all human civilization on a whim. But now I have no one to fight, nothing with which to entertain myself. My kin are all gone, forgotten. 

I am bored. So bored. 

This reanimated corpse held together by my power given human like form, a few little pranks keep me from idling away. It's just not enough. I never knew that a God could lose reason. I never knew that a God could pray for death. Yet why do I feel this very human chill running up the spine when I contemplate an end of existence? 

Existence is burden and non-existence unthinkable. This limbo is pain unlike any I have suffered or inflicted.

'Is this the purpose of our immortality?'

*'...'*

**'...'**

'Answer me, brothers.'

*'...'*

**'...'**

'ZEUS! POSEIDON! ANSWER ME! HAVE I NOT BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH? HOW LONG MUST THIS CONTINUE?'

There was no response. I wish they would respond. I wish I knew if it really was them. I don't remember.

When we faded out of memory, when the humans stopped worshiping us, they slowly died. I am the last one. I survived by creating this immortal doll.

But as they fell to death, they became one with me. Their egos could not bear the end of existence and they clung to me, inhabited my mind. But even a God cannot retain a sense of self without a form to attach itself to.

At first there were twelve. Then eleven. Then ten. Then nine. Until it was just the three of us. The oldest, the strongest. 

But did they fade away as well? Did they? Didn't they? 

It's been two thousand years and I cannot recall anymore. Are they still there or is it just me.

'Hello?'
