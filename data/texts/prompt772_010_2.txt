"Sorry is Peace

Freedom is Being Sorry

Sorry is Strength"

Evegni Kalschin walked down the row of Canadian ministries now built in St. Petersburg. At least the city names weren't forced to change. The countries all did-as did the banners. Repeating the same three lines over and over again, as were the new rules in every city across Old Russia. Now just Canada, along with every other land on Earth. 

The banners weren't even offensive. He had read 1984 in school in the days before the republics fell. He knew what a bad, totalitarian regime looked like from his historical documentaries. This government was nice, though. They were sorry. Sorry they had to take over. Sorry everyone was at war and they had the secret device. Sorry they made one republic fall after another with the device. 

The real change he hated was the entertainment. Once a fun Friday of going to the square with his mates from university to drink pints and watch football, now the only board game you could legally play or watch was 'Sorry!'. And he was not like the local twelve year olds who turned it into an eSport for profit. It was never his game to play. 

Evegni bumped into someone as he caught the train. 

"Sorry" he exclaimed. He heard the person, clearly in a rush, mumble something as he sprinted past. He hoped he had said sorry. The police-who now didn't have to worry about crime and only had to worry about people being polite- were conducting sting operations to see if the old Russians would get with the program as much as the rest of the world. He had always noted that these were the most ironic group who worked nowadays. They never were sorry. Just happy to get more scum off the streets.
