Goddamn, that bus came outta nowhere! It's funny, you never think the rag-doll physics in video games is realistic enough until it happens to you.

I guess I'll walk.
Walk where though? I mean it's not like I need to go to the bank anymore. Home? Yeah, home, sure.
Walking when your dead feels strange. Well... not really. It actually doesn't feel like anything at all, that's the strange part.
Ah, home sweet home. Now then, where are m'keys?
"...Fuck."
Why am I even wearing pants if I don't get to keep the stuff in the pockets?
Maybe I can phase through the door. Ghosts can do that, right?
Nope.
Man, being dead sucks.

I'll keep walking.
I figure if I just keep going eventually I'll hit an ocean.
Alas, once again, nope.
I'm pretty sure this vast, barren expanse is new.
"Hey, look! There's a guy way out there."
He must be dead too. I'll just follow him, he probably knows what he's doing.
Wait a second, he's coming towards me! Should I run? Nah. I mean, what's he gonna do, kill me again?
What's that he's carrying? Holy shit, is that a Scythe?
Oh, right. Duh.

"Mr. Death, I presume?"

"I am one of many Deaths. More to the point, I'm your Death."

"...Cool."
Nothing?
"Ok, so now what?"

"You have a choice to make. You never relinquished your soul to any deity before you died, now you must do so."

"Uh-huh, And if I don't?"

"Everyone does eventually. Some take longer than others, but no one stays indecisive forever."

Wanna bet?
"So what are my options here? Just the big five? Just the ones I've heard of?"

"All of them."

"All of them? Shit, how many is that?"

"Enough."

Oy, this guy.
"So why do they all want me so badly, am I really that important?

"Your soul is valuable to them. The more souls a deity owns, the more powerful they are."

That would be the case, wouldn't it?
"So if I..."

"No more questions. It is time."

Alright, who's first.

"I am the Lord Jehovah, the one true g.."

"Haha! Next!"

"I am Pele, goddess of fire, maker of all the islands of the Pacific."

"Alright, you're the one to beat. Who's next?"

"Kokopelli, I play the flute and get laid nine times a day. Need I say more?"

"I can dig it. Why don't you go keep Pele company over in the 'Maybe' circle."

"May I present Gaia, Mother of all life."

"Hmm... Eh, nah. Next."
Wow, an old Univac. What's that doing here?

"0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001011000010000001001001001000000110000101101101001000000101010001101000011001010010000001000111011011110110010000100000011011110110011000100000010011010110000101100011011010000110100101101110011001010111001100101110
PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE"

"Uh, Death, how much longer is this going to take?"

"As long as it must."

"You're a big help. Imma go take a little break."
Man, being dead really sucks.
What the...?

"So which one are you?"

"Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste."

"No way! You're here too? Awesome!"

"Yeah, I try to persuade people to never choose. But they always do."

"What's the longest anyone went without deciding?"

"Like a few hundred years or so."

"So what happens if I pick you?"

"You get to hang out with all us underworld deities. Hell's not so bad once you get used to it. But don't feel obligated, it is your decision after all. "

Hmm. My decision. My own decision. My own.
Hmm...
"Attention Gods and Goddesses, I have made my choice! I choose..."
Dramatic pause...
"...Me! That's right, screw all you guys! I'm making my own eternal paradise! With blackjack, and hookers!"

"That's not how this works! You must choose!"

"Up yours, Death! You're not the master of me anymore! Now, if anyone needs me, I'll be in my throne room."
That went well.
