Humanity had come and gone.  All save me.  It took over seven hundred million years, but they were all gone now, save me, the last lone survivor of a species that had conquered the stars, developed technologies that made them near-gods, and finally succumbed to what essentially amounted to boredom.  The developments had been fast and furious in the late twenty-first century.  We had learned to move around our own solar system using primitive fusion drives.  We established outposts on Mars, and the moons of Saturn, Titan and Europa.  We built planetoids from asteroids in the Kuniper belt.

Then, we discovered how to truly travel great distances.  We learned to bend the rules of the universe and move faster than light.  The physics involved were both simple and complex.  The concept was trivial, isolate a single bubble of space-time from the rest of it and create a depression in four dimensional space on one side, and a incline on the other side, the bubble rolled down the metaphoric slope.  The fact that it was a bubble of space-time that was moving, and not the object in the bubble, allowed a loop-hole in the understanding of physics that we understood at the time, and we moved faster than the universal speed limit of light.

In a blink, we were at Alpha Centauri, then in a few short years, we spread to five other star systems, then ten, then fifty.  Humanity learned to stop death by natural causes.  We learned to record our minds and then to create new bodies when we needed to.  We discovered the shape of our physical universe more accurately.  We found a four dimensional torus wrapped around the event horizon of a five dimensional black hole and a new flurry of growth and knowledge began.  We learned to move through the slipstream of those massive eddies and currents in gravity around that higher dimensional order black hole and we could appear anywhere.  We found that we could move in time, in some ways.  We could, depending on the direction in four dimensions that the portion of the universe we were in at the time, move back a limited amount of time.  The price was immense and we ran causality backwards incurring massive negative energy debts when we did it, but we could correct mistakes without paradox.

We explored, we evolved, we stretched our understanding of the Universe and all that was in it.  I look back on this with nostalgia and through the lens of memory as a time of new wonders and great discovery.  It wasn’t all glory and light, though.  There were wars.  Great terrible wars that claimed billions and billions of lives across many star systems.  Scorched worlds and dead stars, drained of their energy and light were there, too.  We had terrible weapons that could disrupt entire solar systems, and worse, we used them.  We nearly destroyed ourselves… We were the product of our own violent evolution, after all, and we had to learn to get past it.  This “Great Filter” forced us to change ourselves and to control our own evolution.  

&#x200B;

We fought about that, too.  We diversified into a dozen other species, those focused on the mind, those focused on physical superiority, and those focused on spirituality.  Each of those offshoots (and many, many other offshoots) met their own ends over time, as well.  Some evolved into other things entirely.  Species that drifted between stars over hundreds of years using biological means to slide along on the gravic currents and consuming asteroids and basking in the radiant glow of stars to replenish themselves.  Others ascended to other planes of existence and folded themselves into higher order dimensions and ceased to be human at all, and left all the concerns behind them for contemplation of the infinite.  

&#x200B;

Some devolved, too.  They traded the complex existence of technological society for the simple, brutal carnivorous existence of a planet bound jungle dweller, and the disappeared from history.  They did better than some, worse than others.  I have lived hundreds of millions of years.  I have shepherded species that came after us.  I have helped them learn the path to enlightenment, and away from violence.  Away from the Universes built in “Great Asshole Filter”.  Helped them learn to change themselves for the better, and to build it into their cultures from the beginning.  I have been called a god, I have been called names which humanity didn’t have a concept for.

&#x200B;

Now so many of their emissaries gather around me.  When they were old enough, wise enough, I would reveal myself to them.  I didn’t give them technology.  That way lies destruction for any race who has not earned it of their own accord.  I made that mistake early on, when I was first alone.  I still desperately regret it.  The cost of my mistakes was immense, but I also learned that races make their own decisions.  Life is rare enough in our Universe that each race is unique and splendidly valuable.  

&#x200B;

I wax poetic about these things, because after many long eons, I am finally dying.  I am dying and it can not be stopped.  The parts of a human being (or any sentient species which possesses a soul) age differently when attached to the lower order dimensional form we call a body.  The interface between those higher order dimensions and our three dimensional space time eventually degrades and we become unable to control our bodies from our souls.  I find myself ready to leave, at long last.  I have done my best, and I am ready to face whatever awaits me when I cross the veil.

&#x200B;

I assure them that all will be well.  My efforts are clumsy and ill formed compared to what I once was.  Many of my children can sense it.  I know this, but I have difficulty expressing it to them.  The memories grow fainter and fuzzier as I sit attached to the life support systems that fail, and a root cause that none of my technology can abate.  Time moves incorrectly to me.  Then finally it stops and the universe fades to black.  

&#x200B;

Then it becomes brilliant.  I stand before a sea of people, humans, aliens, I know all of them.  One steps forward with six open arms, “Welcome home father, we’ve been waiting for you for so long!”  I feel different, finally alive after all these long years, but yet they seem only a blink now.  I respond to the greeting with an embrace, and tell them, “At long last, my beloved children, I am home.”
