My name is James, James di Ocren. I'm also world-famous.

I should start from the beginning.

~~------------------~~

So, I'll be one hundred honest. I was totally obsessed by the new MMO, Nothing Beyond. Huge worlds, thousands of quests. So obsessed, that I became the first player to ever reach the max level, level 999.

Of course, it was just a phase. I stopped playing shortly after I hit the level cap. There was truly nothing to do.

Months went by, September passed, October, November. It was only after my birthday, November 29th, did I even play the game again. I was about to format my PC, wanted to recover stuff.

Then hell broke loose.

~~----------------------~~

What I mean is, in-game, two hundred years had passed. A hacker had messed with the game, and started to reign with an iron fist, holding the highest level of all players - tying with me, at 999. I quickly checked the forum.

    renegadeswrath: Where's CompleteIndie?
    getout: You mean that op dood?
    cartooncraze: Who else is level 999?
    horrorshow2: Well, the emperor, for one.
    movingpictures: he doesn't count.

Took me a minute to understand what was going on. People were talking about me? A nobody who just had a lot of time of his hands?

...

I knew what I had to do.

~~--------------------~~

It was a long, perilous journey, but I finally got to the castle.
The emperor, a player by the name of *Intensity Intensifies*, had hacked the game. Built a castle, cheated from level 13 to 999. The admins didn't even care.

But there was things uncounted for.

He got to that level through cheats. He doesn't that much experience playing. He doesn't know all the tricks and tips
I do. 

~~-----------------------~~

In the castle, *Intensity Intensifies* looked at me, and over the mic he spoke.

"Greetings." he chuckled. "So, you're the guy who got to the max."

"Yes." I replied. "And I challenge you."

"Me? The emperor? I have servants, hell, *Giovanni24*, get over here." He stopped for a moment, before yelling into the mic. "What do you mean, you're done? I'll - don't you dare hang -"

He froze.

"Fine." The emperor said. He pulled out his sword, Excalibur. The same as me. "En garde."
