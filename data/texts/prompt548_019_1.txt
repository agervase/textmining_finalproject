Incense burning? Check. Highly detailed summoning circle? I glanced at my book. Check. Enigma on the stereo? Well, the book didn’t say and it probably wasn’t strictly required but it felt right anyway. The book had explained I should do the summoning outside with lots of room, so I was using the blacktop of the local elementary school. No one was around at 10:30 on a Thursday night. 

&nbsp;

I took a deep breath and stepped into the circle, careful not to smudge any of the chalk lines or glyphs. I checked the book again. Summoning a Demon. I realized even then that this may not have been my best idea, but I wasn’t going to let all that tedious drawing go to waste. Plus maybe a demon could solve my problem. A deal with the devil and so on. 

&nbsp;

I began chanting the words in the spiral bound book as proscribed, three times. Nothing happened for a moment. I assumed at first it hadn’t worked because truth be told I don’t speak Sanskrit or Sumerian or whatever was written down. Fortunately it was spelled out below phonetically.   

&nbsp;

But then there was a loud bang. Two huge bright lights were shone in my eyes making my look away. A loud, awful noise drowned out “Sadness.”   

&nbsp;

“Who,” I screamed as I started to back away, trying not to break the summoning circle lines -- I didn’t want this demon to escape. “Are you? What is your name, demon? I command you to serve me!”   

&nbsp;

The noise stopped. The two lights reduced so that they were no longer quite as blinding. A mechanical whirring seemed to chuckle at me.   

&nbsp;

“Demon? I think you’ve got that wrong, son.”   

&nbsp;

“Beast from the underworld, terror of nightmares, or Satan himself. Whatever you wish to be called let it be known, but don’t play games with me,” I said. I figured you needed to be firm with a demon or he might try to possess me or something.  

&nbsp;

There was a pause as the beast softly rumbled. “Dodge Caravan,” it said.  

&nbsp;

“Excuse me, what?”   

&nbsp;

“Well, Dave never gave me a real name, and I guess I could go by my VIN number, but even though that’s supposedly unique to me it just seems so *impersonal*, you know?”   

&nbsp;

I did not know. But I was starting to think something had gone very wrong. “Did I summon a car somehow?” I said.  

&nbsp;

“Van not a car!” It sounded miffed. “Check it. Three full rows of seats, plenty of storage. Sliding doors on both sides. You could strap a canoe to my top rack if you wanted. I’d like to see your Honda Accord do *that*.”  

&nbsp;

“But how is this possible? I followed the directions in the book exactly.”  

&nbsp;

“Oh! You must have gotten Dave’s journal. Yeah, when he didn’t want to pay for parking at a sporting event or whatever he’d send me to the netherrealms and then summon me again later. Dave was pretty cheap.”  

&nbsp;

“But it says Summoning a Demon at the top here!”   

&nbsp;

“Let me see.”  

&nbsp;

I held out the book in the van’s direction, not quite sure where an animated vehicle’s eyes are. “See? right at the top!” 

&nbsp; 

“Oh. That *asshole*.” That’s not a D. In Dave’s horrible handwriting that’s an L. He’s written “How to summon a Lemon.” The Caravan seemed to be getting worked up. If I didn’t know better, it literally shifted gears as it began to mutter to itself. “You break down one time in the middle of Kansas, and he’ll never let you live it down!”
