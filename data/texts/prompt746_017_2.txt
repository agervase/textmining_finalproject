She had always been a lonely child, never playing with the other children. Perhaps that's what drew the gaze of this pathetic wretch of a man I gaze upon now. No one will take our Shepherd away from us. We gather to her like flies to honey, we can't help ourselves. The girl is one of those chosen few who can channel magic into this world. We gather in her room and hide ourselves just out of sight from her so that we do not scare her. We must not scare her, one day we will reveal ourselves and help her awaken so that she may help us as we now help her. First however we must protect her. 

That duty falls to me. For I am the haunting steps that echo in the night. The Silent Hunter. The wolf in sheeps clothing. The Bogeyman. And I will not allow our shepherd to be taken. I stare down at this man who dared to steal our sweet sweet child away from us. He struggles against the grip of my claws as they press against his throat, binding him to the floor. My fur bristles in excitement as I squeeze down and slice his neck into ribbons. His life essence begins to flow from his body and I snatch it before it can escape to the ether. A quick swallow and that too dissapears. 

I hear whimpering in the next room and I take a moment to change my form. My dark shaggy fur turns white and fluffy. My claws meld into cloven hooves for my feet and large soft fingers for my hands. Finally my face becomes less angular and more round. I walked into the next room and see the darling child I was sent to rescue. I undo her bindings and lift her into my arms. She cries and clings to me as I gently brush my hands through her hair and sing her to sleep. "Mary had a little lamb, it's fleece as white as snow."
