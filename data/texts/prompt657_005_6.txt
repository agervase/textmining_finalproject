It had been a long time from when I entered the Hero Association to when I was first defeated. Years in fact. I had risen from the bottom to one of the most well respected and powerful superheroes. I lived a great life with the fame and fortune my status brought me. I didn't understand it but my power seemed to be luck. Attacks would miss me, robbers would trip and fall in front of me. Villains would show up defeated in front of me and I would get the credit. At least that was until the day I realized how truly powerless I was. 

I had followed a small gang to a warehouse. It should have been simple, but they had quickly hit me. Somehow their punches hit me! I was punched and kicked. It had been so long since I had felt pain. I thought I was going to die when another hero came in.

 They called him sloth, an ironic hero name. He was always trying hard. He always showed up to fight, and to be a hero. Though he had never actually managed to do anything. However, when he approached bullets missed him even as he got close. As the men  swung with steel bars they hit their companions. He tripped them as he slowly walked towards me and one by one they fell. Soon Sloth stood in front of me. "Well you look horrible man and you have a big formal dinner to attend tonight." (All the top hero's where expected to show.) He untied me and helped me stand up. "I should count myself lucky I do not have to be there. Especially if I looked like you." He said with a wink, turning and walking away. "You hate crowds don't You?" I asked to his turned back. 

"Luck can take many forms" Sloth said in response as he blended back into the background, unnoticed. The place he belonged.
