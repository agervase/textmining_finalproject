Feel free to replace the pronouns with your cats name, or lizards.

It's been a long day, I was just in a bad mood. I just got to my apartment and opened the door. Just then my kitty strolled around the corner with a swagger in each step. He then started rubbing his head on my leg. It felt so warm. I totally forgot what was troubling. I stumbled to the couch and he jumped on my lap. He began to purr as I started petting his head. I turned on the tv and began to rewind with my kitty. My phone vibrates; I glance down and see it's from the business factory. I hit the end call button then go back to petting him. Suddenly, he jumps off my lap and runs off. I jump up and go after him. He went under my bed and I can see his eyes under there. "Come here kitty" I say. A few minutes pass and then he comes out with a small lizard in his mouth. He sets it on the ground and meows. I slowly lay the lizard on the palm of my hand. He looked healthy just wasn't really moving. I'm gonna name you "(insert lizard name here.) that's a great name." I say to myself.

I didn't have a lizard cage so I put him in an old coffee cup and get in my car to go get a cage and go to the vet. At the vet with my new lizard. I tell the staff about how my cat found him and they take him back. Soon then come out and tell me he was perfectly healthy. They hand me back and I pet his chin

Sorry if my writing style is weird or bad I've never written narratively before
