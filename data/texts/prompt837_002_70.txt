&#x200B;

"Camera is on... go ahead and start wherever you'd like."

&#x200B;

I've been workin the beat for 15 years now. LAPD. I never wanted to do anything more. I always hear my coworkers saying they get into all kinds of crazy scraps where they were glad their gun was ready to save them. Me? I was one of the very few officers who had never drawn his gun. I'm no slug, and I've gotten into plenty of scraps, but it's just something that happens.

&#x200B;

Until yesterday, at least. This is the Shift Supervisor at precinct 43 giving a verbal report of the events that happened yesterday, November 7th. My name is being omitted for departmental reasons.

&#x200B;

I was working the night shift. I always liked the night shift, just because of the crazy shit that happens. If something weird is gonna happen, it's gonna happen on the night shift. It's different every time. I was promoted to sergeant just last month, and I was given the all clear: this was my first night alone as shift supervisor.

&#x200B;

Now when you're shift supervisor, you need to be available when called. You let the grunts do traffic stops and handle domestics, things like that. Anytime a shift supervisor is requested, you need to be there. Night shift? Hah. Pull your own weight, mister big shot.

&#x200B;

“Unit 324, 10-8, shift supervisor on site.” I said on the radio.

&#x200B;

“Copy 324, have a good shift.” That was Matt on dispatch. Matt always said that. Nice guy.

&#x200B;

“Thanks, Matt.” I said to nobody. I check the squad car top to bottom, back to front. No contraband, and no bodily fluids. All clear, and I load it up. I check the ammunition and the AR-15 and shotgun. All locked up, fully loaded, ready to go. Doubt I'll ever need it, but I'm not an idiot. Just because I never used my gun out in the field doesn't mean I'm careless.

&#x200B;

My night begins at 2200 hours. I begin my loop, starting at the five, and work my way down to Monterey Park. The usual radio chatter is my music of the night. Alarms, break ins, druggies, and trespassing, the usual LA night. In my head I'm playing the music from my car: A mix of dad rock and some Russian music I heard on the internet.

&#x200B;

“Unit 324, respond to a 415 at Wilmington and Hawthorne, possible weapon involved.” The radio brings me back to from my mental DJ-ing and stops my bad singing. 415 was a disturbance. I picked up the radio and replied.

&#x200B;

“324 responding.” I decided against rolling lights and sirens and just gunned it. I didn't want to spook anyone. After about ten minutes, I arrive on the scene outside of a construction site near the LA river. There was nobody around, and the construction site was dimly lit. Quiet. False alarm, maybe?

&#x200B;

“324 on scene. Dispatch who made the call?”

&#x200B;

“Caller was a passerby, claimed to be wrestling with an individual in ragged, torn clothes. They claimed it looked like an animal attack.”

&#x200B;

Homeless fight, huh? That sucks.

&#x200B;

Wait, an animal attack? What the hell...

&#x200B;

“Shift supervisor requesting additional units and animal control to Willmington and Hawthorne.” Something at the back of my head itched. I always trusted the back of my head. It itched when a crack head swung a golf club behind my head. Ducked just in time. It itched when a group of kids plowed out of an old guys house, and then an old guy came back, dragging one of the kids with chains wrapped around him. It itched when a guy tried to stab his 3 year old who called the cops wanting to meet a real police officer. I took the guy down with a taser before he even got to his kid, and gave the kid a new, better home.

&#x200B;

The back of my head itched at the sound of animal attack. LA was never known for its wildlife population, nor was it known for its silence. But tonight, right where I sat, it was silent.

&#x200B;

I unlocked the shotgun, got out of the car, and looked around. I was alone... right? With the shotgun firmly in my hands, I listened hard and scanned the area. I heard the faintest sound of what I could describe as scratching, and breathing. I felt eyes on me. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I turned, weapon raised, and looked at what I could only imagine out of a movie. A really good movie.

&#x200B;

Through a broken fence I saw it. It had two glowing yellow eyes. Its skin was pale, almost human looking. It was hairless and naked, except for the blood and gore around an impossibly large, wide mouth. It opened its mouth, and I could smell its breath even from the distance I stood. It smelled of death. The darkness shrouded the rest of its body. I wasn't sure at the time I was fully prepared to see the entire thing, but I had a pretty good idea that it was even more horrible. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. If I was even seeing it. All I could do was do what they had trained me to do 15 years ago.

&#x200B;

“LAPD! Get your hands up and get on the ground!” I forced myself to believe it was a kid in a mask, or a costume, or something, anything to rationalize what I was seeing. There was no way it was real. Next thing I know, two officers roll up behind me, guns drawn. I look over to see corporal Stensen and officer Daniels. I turned back to the suspect, only to find he was gone.

&#x200B;

“Sergeant! What's going on?” Corporal Stensen was a family man. He'd been on the force for about 5 years now, with dreams of being a captain. Officer Daniels was fresh out of the academy, however. This was his first day.

&#x200B;

What the hell was I supposed to say? Hey there's some kinda fuckin monster over there, let's go get em boys? I didn't know if what I even saw was real or not. None the less, I treated it like any dangerous call.

&#x200B;

“You two form up on me!” I had my shotgun raised the whole time. I heard the two of them say yes sir behind my back as I went through the hole in the fence. We approach the area where I saw it, and I don't know why, but I felt relief. I was relieved because there was a pool of blood where that thing stood. Maybe I was relieved that I wasn't losing my mind.

&#x200B;

“Holy shit...” Officer Daniels breathed. It was a lot of blood, that's for sure. My guess was a liter.

&#x200B;

“Sergeant, what the hell?” Corporal Stenson was up next to be shocked. I stared at the thick pool. Blood isn't like you see on the movies. It's thick, really thick. Someone in the academy described it as “ketchup.” They're not wrong.

&#x200B;

I was in thought for what felt like an eternity. I can't call SWAT for a pool of blood, and I can't exactly tell these guys what I saw. But what WAS it? It looked dangerous, and it definitely was some kind of animal. Or something. Well, it was too dangerous to call animal control now. What was in front of us was fresh. We needed to act quickly.

&#x200B;

It was just a few seconds after Corporal Stensen spoke that I gave the orders.

&#x200B;

“Call for backup. I was a perimeter and I want a helicopter. Let's see about getting a dog as well. I want whoever owns this place to give me a detailed plan of the site. I don't care who has to be woken up, wake up the CEO if you have to. Let's get it done!”

&#x200B;

They both nodded and we climbed through the hole again. About twenty minutes later, four more cop cars were rolling code 3 and a helicopter was in the air. We told dispatch that the animal had possibly killed a person, and the dog was to help find either the person or the animal, whichever came first. The perimeter was formed, and the other officers appeared in front of me for debrief.

&#x200B;

“Earlier this evening we got a 415 on the radio. Upon my arrival, we discovered a lot of blood. I was just emailed a detailed plan of the layout at the construction site. We're going to go in a grid formation and search the area. We are going to assume both the people and the animal are dangerous. I wan-”

&#x200B;

A scream like something out of a nightmare cut off my train of thought. It came from a woman. A few seconds later, the sound of what I would professionally call a monster tore through the night. Nobody said a word.
