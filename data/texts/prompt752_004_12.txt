Not understanding why this familiar but distant feeling was happening, I sit up. It was odd. Not odd as in looks but in the feeling of sitting up almost effortlessly at my age. It had been ages since I felt... good? Young? Able to endure the day, I suppose? 

"Meh, maybe today's a good day! No arthritis first thing in the morning" I thought to myself as I positioned my body to get out of my ever calling bed. Yes at this age you still crave sleep as you did in your youth and my bed needed me. But I needed to investigate this first! 

As my eyes adjusted to the new mornings light on my bare feet I thought "It's gonna be a great d..." I stopped cold in my thought and my body froze. My feet; they were not mine! They couldn't be! Same with the legs attached to them, not mine either! Curiosity wained to fear and concern as I sat confused as the mornings cold nipped away at my newly acquired youthful toes. 

I hurried to the bathroom for a mirror, anything to justify I was still I. As I made my way across the room i did so with only a few strides; much fewer than normal. This only deepened the anxiety towards the feeling I just experienced in my bed. 

When I got to the mirror, it didn't help; it was me. Young, maybe late thirties me though. My mind immediately races back to the two cheap dollar store candles and how I moved them. Preposterous! "How can moving candles have such an effect? If I'd have known I would have done this at 92 instead!" I thought musingly as I stared into an obviously broken mirror. 
"Whaaa..." I said disingenuously confused. "This cannot be!". 
But it was, and the day had just started.
