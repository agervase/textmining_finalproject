"It's only procedure", they said. "This path leads to the Gates of Judgement; those that stray..." Their hood-shrouded head looked into the distance; a wide silver path lay ahead, trailing into inky darkness. "We do not speak of their fate."

Jace was confused. What could be happened to the others? And how was he so sure he was dead? It was only 5 minutes ago he was happily driving home and that guy ran the red light and- OH. 

"You haven't spoken a word this whole time. Have you been listening?"

<Yes.> Jace signed with a frown. <I'm not deaf, just mute.>

Grim chuckled softly. "Well, okay, then. Follow close." They began waking, the human following a few steps behind.

It wasn't long before the crying could be heard. Both of them ignored it (or tried to, at least.) It only got louder and louder before Jace whirled around to face it, while Death simply walked on.

A pale little girl had appeared behind Jace, tears flowing down her face. "Please help me! My brother is hurt over here!" she cried, pointing to the darkness before taking off. 

Without thinking, he started to move, as well; injury was no joke and, like in life, he wanted to be sure of everyone's safety. Besides, it wasn't like he could scream for Grim to stop. But before he could step off, Jace felt the cold edge of a blade press into his waist. Looking back, there was Grim, scythe spun out in front of him. Protecting Jace like a shepherd would his flock.

"That is one fate of those that stray." He sighed, moving the blade away with nimble bone fingers. "Keep up, and I will protect you. They only get worse from here on."

Wide-eyed with worry, Jace could only nod. And with the dust cleared, they kept moving onward toward judgement.
