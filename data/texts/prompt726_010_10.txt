It’s a tin can world.

That’s what I’ve decided. The ‘bots keep showing us pictures of round marbles called “planets” that we supposedly lived on, but I know they’re wrong. We are meant to live on the inside of great big tin cans. To live on the outside of a sphere, with no metal between you and the vacuum, it’s insane.

The ‘bots have no proof anyways. They show us pictures, but I only trust what I can see with my eyes at this point. And guess what I don’t see – “planets”. There are airless chunks of “rock”, no larger than our cans, crawling with the cousins of the ‘bots. I’m sure they’re just like our ‘bots, even if they are bigger. They make our worlds, but they can’t make “planets”. No-one could do that.

And it’s because no-one can make planets that I know they aren’t real – just wishful thinking on the part of the ‘bots. They say we came from a “planet” and crossed the stars in a tiny tin can – like the size of one of those “coke” drinks that they say we once enjoyed. It’s possible that we came from something like that – I often see smaller ‘bots building bigger ones. But you can’t build a planet. It isn’t possible.

And I know that we didn’t come from a planet. The ‘bots showed us where our home once was – you can’t really see it without a ‘scope. With a ‘scope, though, I can see the truth. We came from a tin can world. We came from millions of tin can worlds. I can see them there, running endlessly around our old star.

And now I see something else. Something that will prove the ‘bots wrong and show that I was right. I can see a can, with a great big sail behind it. I think it’s breaking in the wind of our star. It’s coming to meet us, and I know that they’ll tell us that we come from a tin can world.

After all, we could never have lived on a “planet”. What a stupid idea.

*I know it doesn't really focus on the prompt, but I though that the lack of humans to teach other humans could spawn some interesting "flat Earth" type stories.
