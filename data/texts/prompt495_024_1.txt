I waited.

I withered.

I witnessed.

I waited for the next person to step through those doors, those empty, dark doors, that only led to a view of somebodies dreams.
I withered under the winds that blew against my cold, dark cloak.
I witnessed the fear of the humans as I appeared from a far, watching them as they enjoy their last few moments of a beating heart. At least a beating heart they are convinced they have.
 
I waited.

I withered.

I witnessed.

And then they opened, and he was there. That same man. Suddenly what seemed to be all of existence folded into a green, cascading wilderness of forest, clearings and mountain tops. I was not close, I must admit, but I couldn’t forget his pale skin, his thin body, his brown hair, or his icy blue eyes. I stood from a far, on a cliff edge. It was grassy and stony, shrouded by mountains and trees on every side, every angle, hidden.

Hey sat and lay under the blue sky, in front of the view so mighty it overpowered any confusion he had. My time had arrived. My cue. I stepped forward, through the trees, scythe in my bony, skinless hand, hood on, shadows comforting me. I was the very essence of the words, “The end”.
The trees died and withered as I brushed my left hand on their trunks, their leaves shriveling. He noticed me standing on the cliffs edge obviously, but he didn’t freak out, start crying, or even attempt the leave through the doors again. He stood and waved. This was my cue, as it seemed, to go up to him. 

Smoky shadows engulfed me as I appeared beside him. He still barely flinched, although he turned and stared at me with wonder. I was almost double his size, holding a weapon that represented death itself, I was hidden in a black cloak, and he could clearly see my grey, skinless hand as I put it on his shoulder. He spoke in raspy, shy voice that completed countered the words he had said.

‘I’m Gage, but you obviously don’t need much of an introduction. Grim reaper, if I’m correct?’ I nodded.

I stuck my free hand out to my side, signaling for him to follow me. He did. I felt the first emotion I had felt in a long time, relief. There was an unspoken connection, a similarity that was so diverse it barely existed, yet it also existed completely. A large bridge formed under our feet as we stepped off of a cliffs edge. He didn’t flinch, and it was this that I knew, he had seen it all before. I decided it would be fit if I stopped halfway across the bridge, and removed my hood to show him my skinless, hairless skull. My empty eye sockets landed on him, as he faced me again. I couldn’t stop myself, but suddenly the first words I had spoken for thousands of years spurted out.

‘You could go back you know, you have done it before.’ My voice was similar to his, only older and drier. He shook his head with the utmost politeness.

‘No no, enough of that. I was there for too long. It is a very kind offer, might I add, but my time has arrived. I must finally move on from life, and experience part two of my existence.’ They were the bravest words I had heard from a soul in a long time. A pair of tall, thin doors appeared in front us, words in a language only I knew decorated the frame. I opened them for him, and said the sentence I gave any one who walked through them.

‘I, am your door man.’ I disappeared onto the side of the bridge we started walking on, and watched him as I enjoyed the breeze on my skinless face. He turned and waved at me as the naturalistic area around us descended into darkness, and he committed his final steps of “Living” towards entering the door. They disappeared with him, and I donned my hood again as I waited.

I waited.

I withered.

I witnessed.
