"That's him " the voice whispered in my ear. "The one who killed me."

It was a small voice, a child's voice. Couldn't have been older than 10.

"So Anna, can you tell me if you're picking up any 'psychic' vibes here?"

"A child," I said. "A little boy, maybe 8, 9 years old."

Billy Walker's face started to turn pale. His chest heaved with his quickening breath.

"I was so hungry, Miss. I hadn't eaten in 2 days. I just wanted a sandwich. He grabbed my neck...I couldn't breathe," the invisible voice whispered.

"Poor little one. Found dead of strangulation. So small...must have been starved before he died."

I held the host's gaze.

"You...you had a son that age, didn't you, Mr. Walker? About that age who died about 10 years ago."

Billy's hands trembled as he held the microphone. His mouth opened, but no sound escaped.

"Your bio says he passed away in his sleep from an undiagnosed illness." I paused. "You lied, Mr. Walker."

Billy dropped the microphone and tore out his earpiece. The cameraman whipped around to face the host.

"He was your son, Mr. Walker...How could you?"

Billy turned and started to walk towards the entrance of the house. I quickly followed, followed in turn by the cameraman and sound guy. Outside, more camera operators were waiting. The producers ran out of the parked van.

"He was your son!!!" I shouted, tears filling my eyes. "He needed you, and you failed him! You killed your son!"

He tried to run, but the producers caught up with him, forming a blockade on the sidewalk. Sirens echoed in the distance. Someone must have called the police.

"Um...we have Mrs. Walker on the phone," said one of the producers, holding their cell phone aloft.

"It's true!" The voice cried over the speaker. "He threatened to kill me if I told anyone the truth. You killed my baby, William! You killed my baby!" She wailed.

Two policecars arrived on scene. Their drivers stepped out, hands on their holstered guns.

"Thank you," the little voice whispered.
