"I told you, Urglesh!" yelled the Scourge of Ten Worlds, "I told you they were real!" His back was pinned against a baroque, iron door.

"Yeah well, I thought you were joking, humans are a myth! Everyone knows that, even little demonettes and imps. Shut up and grab that chair and block the door." The Scourge scrambled for a bone chair and wedged it between the eternal handle and the soulstone floor.

"Oh Lucifer, oh Lucifer help us!" squeaked the nameless horror from the corner of the room. He rocked back and forwards with his hands on his horns.

".....Urglesh, has it gone?"

".....I don't know. It's gone quiet."

"It's up to something! I heard they can teleport!"

*tap tap tap*

"Nyaaaaagh, it's at the door! Go away foul creature, leave us in suffering!"

"Human, foul beast, what do you want with us? Please, don't hurt us!"

"....okay it's just that I'd like to go home?"

"THEN GO!"

"Well... I'm not sure how?"

"....is this a trap?"

"No. I'd rather like to go, I don't know where I am and I don't think I like it. Why is everything screaming?"

"I.... well, they are the lost souls of the damned. I only got them last month," pouted the Scourge, "They're not cheap, you know."

"I see. They're.... yes. Quite. So, do you think I could go home?"

"Urglesh, can we send..... it.... home?"

"I don't know, maybe?"

"....oh good, thank you. I'll just wait out here, shall I?"

"Yes! Don't touch anything."

"Right, no, of course. I'll just have a sit down and let you chaps sort it out. I don't suppose you've got any tea? No, silly question." They heard shuffling and footsteps. None of them moved, lest it return.

Urglesh put one of his twelve eyes to the keyhole in the infernal door, checking if the coast was clear.

"Don't look!" shouted the scourge, "I heard they can turn you to stone with a glance!"

"I tell you, nameless horror, those things creep me out. Did you see its skin? It wasn't moving or bleeding, and it didn't even have horns..."

"And what in the nine heavens is 'tea'?"
