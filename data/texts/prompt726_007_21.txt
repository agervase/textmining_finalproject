I am writing this because I got into a fight.  Teacher says that it was over something stupid, and when we "do something stupid, we must reflect on it".  Teacher told me to write about it, so I am writing about what we were fighting about so that I can figure out why it was stupid.

We were talking about why we were on this dumb planet and why we had to do this dumb training, and why there was nobody else on this planet.  Frizz said it was because our home was dying.  Frizz is pupil M835A2, but we call him Frizz because he has frizzy hair.  He always grins a little when we call him that, so I think he likes it.  Anyway, Nose said that was stupid and that it was because Frizz's parents didn't love him.  Nose is a jerk and he has a big nose, so we all knew he was going to say something like that anyway, but that's not why I hit him.  Oh yeah, Nose is Pupil R56A2.  Frizz just rolled his eyes at Nose, but Nose wanted somebody to get mad, so he just wouldn't shut up.  He started to pick on Mittens, Pupil S4A2, saying that even if they didn't love him, at least Frizz had real parents, but Mittens was a science experiment, since she is a Science-type with her "S" number as a pupil, and all.  Mittens is always nice to everybody, even Mittens, so I got mad and punched Nose in his big, fat nose.

I know I was wrong because I am pupil C1A2, and as a Command-type, I will command group A2 as we rebuild this planet for us.  I should be learning how to make everyone get along better, even the Rifle-types and the Medic-types and not sticking up for only one type.  And, as Teacher always says, "There are only a few million of you against several billion of these humans, so you have got to stick together, or you will never take over the planet."
