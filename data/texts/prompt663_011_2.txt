**You are the 100 billionth to die. You may undo any single decision**  
“Yes! I—“  
**BUT I will inform you that you have already had your decision to undo your decision on what to undo has already repeated until by some miracle, enough quantum uncertainties piled together to make you change your decision.**  
“Then I—“  
**You also undid ‘the decision to take this request literally instead of by intent of the wisher’ and ‘The ‘decision to limit the definition of decisions to actions taken by entities’’**  
At this point I started nodding my head, knowing what would come next, but saying nothing in case I was wrong.  
**Followed by undoing ‘the decision to make the events leading to your death as the 100 billionth person non-deterministic’ I complemented the wording after undoing ‘the decision to have the avatar of death have no personality’, a choice which has me in constant torment during our many sessions by the way.**  
Oof. I felt a little bad.  
**Yes, but you’re still too amused to change it back. Anyhow, you’ve got ‘the decision to not include previously undone decisions as part of the introductory sequence’, which is why I am doing all of this and ‘the decision which makes the avatar of death capable of lying’, but don’t worry, you also have ‘the decision to have ‘you’ go as any title other than ‘avatar of death’’—**  
“Alright, I’ll cut to the chase for this round, ‘the decision to call ‘undoing decisions’ to be referred to as wishes when referring to decisions chosen in the past. That’ll help out the next version of me get a grasp on things I think.”  
**Of course, another minor quality of life improvement for you....**  
“See you soon!”  
**I wish I could undo the decision to let this reward exist**
