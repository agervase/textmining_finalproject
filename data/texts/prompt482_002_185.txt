(This one kind of strayed from the prompt. I'm going to make some edits to make things happen without any actual effort from the protagonist.)

Kirk T. Burbank shrugged on his jacket and walked out the door into the crisp fall air. Stepping outside Kirk was greeted by an assortment of familiar sights and smells. His neighbor and good friend, Charlie scraping the light frost of the front of his sedan, his wife Melanie on the front porch sipping her coffee, their young son at her side ready to wave farewell.

&#x200B;

"Hi Uncle B!" the little ragamuffin yelled right on cue, waving emphatically at his dad's friend. "Hey CJ!" Kirk chimed back. Waving to Mel and shooting a nod at Charlie. Kirk hopped into his car, backed out of the driveway and headed towards his office. Hoping that today he'd have a quiet, easy day.  Being a hero was fun. But sometimes you just wanted to file some reports and flirt with Stacey in the breakroom. Kirk tuned his radio to his favourite station, and settled in for the relatively short drive to work.

&#x200B;

\*You're listening to 101.9 the Breeze! Seahaven's home for classic rock and your safe harbor for everything going on in our great little town.\*

&#x200B;

The familiar voice rattled off the traffic and weather, nothing overly shocking. He was pleased to hear that the rain forecast had been pushed off for another few days. He'd inherited his father's fear of water, but come by it honestly at least. Kirk had nearly drowned in a pool as a toddler.  Just being out in it rain made him uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Kirk shook off the unease the idea of water caused him and turned up the radio. The familiar riff of "Jumpin Jack Flash," echoed on his radio. He made the same left turn he did every day. And headed up the hill towards his office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hours later Kirk hopped back in his car. A flush on his face from the hug Stacey had given him after he'd asked her for dinner this weekend. He could definitely feel their relationship blooming and was excited at the prospects. But resolved himself to take it slowly. Not wanting to wreck the friendship in the process of courting the romantic side.

&#x200B;

He eased forward into traffic, taking the right turn onto the 4 lane "hiway" that led back to the suburbs of his quaint portside town. Grinning as his favourite song came on the radio, he rattled off the opening lyrics to "Bohemian Rhapsody" alongside his favorite singer.

Just then a car came flying past him, tires squealing as a sharp corner was made, ricocheting off a nearby parked minivan and careening down the street. Kirk looked in his rear-view mirror and heard the sounds of sirens in the distance. However, he was confident they'd never catch up. Thinking quickly, Kirk flipped on his hazards and punched the accelerator.

&#x200B;

Kirk didn't know how he'd become such a good driver. It had just happened one day, when Charlie's appendix had burst while they were camping and Kirk needed to rush him to the hospital. He'd slipped in and out of traffic with ease. Finding gaps where they didn't exist seconds before.  He'd made the 45 minute drive to the nearest hospital in about 25 minutes, launching down a hill, jumping a train track and taking shortcuts he didn't even know existed.

&#x200B;

"It was like Jesus took the wheel" Kirk had laughed. Almost like someone else was driving through him, giving him an uncanny sense of where to go even if he was unsure moments before.

The fear had left him a year or so prior. Enough of these incidents popping up had given him the confidence to know that he was the best driver on the road. Kirk knew that he'd be safe and drove with abandon as he hopped a shoulder and up onto the curb beside the fleeing getaway car. The black masked felons in the car reached a weapon out of the vehicle and shot, Kirk stomped the brake and fell in behind, narrowly avoiding being clipped.

&#x200B;

\*Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me!\*

&#x200B;

The radio chimed in as Kirk swept into oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding a freight truck and expertly clipping the back end of the escape vehicle. The car spun around and faced oncoming traffic, one side pinned up against a parked car, sirens rapidly approaching. Kirk pushed his vehicle right up against the passenger side of the vehicle. Trapping the passengers inside.

&#x200B;

\* Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go\*

&#x200B;

The radio's near perfect timing made Kirk smile, springing from his vehicle he walked in front of the pinned vehicle, "Fun's over boys stay inside your car!" he commanded and waited for the boys in blue to arrive.

&#x200B;

One of the drivers had other ideas and crawled out of the sunroof.  Kirk sprung into action. Running up the front of the car and grabbing the future convict by the neck of his coat. He pulled him easily out of the car, and flung him down on the pavement. Springing down on top of him and pinning him while the cops arrived. "You just got unlucky." He said to the man on the pavement below him. "You took the wrong turn, criminal!"

&#x200B;

Kirk looked up and grinned as he saw Captain Shaw, Charlie's father was first to the scene. It was always easier when Shaw was there. He'd let Kirk quietly slip away before the reporters showed up and tried to interview him.

&#x200B;

The man pinned under Kirk had stopped struggling but looked up at Kirk as Shaw pulled the mask from his face.  "I'm going to hurt you one day, you bastard!" He yelled at Kirk's back as he walked away.  "I don't know how! But I'll hurt you or someone you love! You're not invincible Captain Americar!"

&#x200B;

Kirk laughed to himself, safe in the knowledge that he could take on any would-be villain. This wasn't his first run-in with a criminal. Waving goodbye to the grateful police, he started his car and drove away. Back to his comfortable, familiar suburban life in Seahaven.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Man I wish he'd come up with a better name." -  'Captain Americar' had been a bit of a trademark nightmare but Disney had eventually bought in too. 'Shaw' helped the man on the pavement up and dusted him off. "Good work Jorge you really sold that one. Shame he got your face though. Sounds like command-center already has a good storyline from your improv though. Stacey's being briefed as we speak."

&#x200B;

The stuntman stood. His body creaked, he hadn't expected to bear the full weight of Burbank as he jumped off the car and he'd have bruises for weeks dealing with the impact.  "I just wish he had a better catch phrase." He sighed rolling his eyes and mimed mockingly, "You took the wrong turn? Give me a break."

&#x200B;

Jorge radio'd up to command. "Did we get all that? You guys happy?"

&#x200B;

Far above, looking down from the top of the massive dome was the command centre, refurbed since the show was revived.  "Great job boys," Christof said, placing a hand gently on his professional driver. He looked over at the shows co-creator. "What'd you think T?" he asked, cautious as ever. Aware that he had to ensure his former star was pleased.

&#x200B;

The elder Burbank looked at the wall of monitors recording his son.  He replayed the incident from his son's early life, where he'd somehow fallen into the pool in the backyard and almost drowned. He sighed and smiled back at Christof. "Yes, as long as he's safe and happy." He said. And looked back at his son. First name Kirk after his TV father, middle name Truman after himself.

&#x200B;

Christof smiled, the Truman show reboot had been a ratings success. And this time he had Truman's buy-in completely. And every American TV tuned in 24/7/365.
