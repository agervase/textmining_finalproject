Following the flash my TV shook violently on its wall mount. I hear the dog running toward the backdoor barking helplessly at what used to be a yard, debris littered the yard burning the grass all around a newly formed crater.

I stare from my couch, frozen in time and unsure what to do next. Was it an attack? Did something crash? I slowly get up and apprehensively approach the back door. "GET BACK, DOWN!" I yelled at the dog. "Zelda, get in your cage!" She quickly runs back towards the wall and promptly sits in her cage. "Good girl, now stay" I said while slowly opening the door I take one last look back at my dog and slip outside closing the door behind me.

The smoke was intense but I could see almost exactly where the foreign object landed. "What is that?!" Yelled my neighbor. "Your guess is as good as mine." I said. "Hey DON'T get near that thing, we don't know what it is" he said. I replied, "Whatever it is it would have exploded by now and we would all be dead." I approached the object slowly swatting the smoke away from my face. Laying up against my patio furniture is a mop I placed out earlier to dry. I grab it with my right hand and move closer to the crater. The smoke is still too thick to see so I wait a couple more minutes before moving in.

The smoke slowly clears, I make out what appears to be some sort of cylinder. "What is it?" My neighbor yells. "I don't know it looks like a UFO, no joke man its like a cylinder." I said. "No way man, really what is it?" My neighbor said. "No *seriously*." I said. 

The smoke begins to settle quickly and I see what appears to be a blade crudely attached to the front, the object has a red light blinking near the front. The light suddenly turns green and it rotates quickly towards my direction.

"James Walker?" the object said. I paused, shocked that it knew or presumed to know my name. "No." I said. "Did that thing just call out your name James?" said my neighbor. The blinking green light faced him as he blurted out my name, the object then slowly looked back at me and the green light quickly turned from green to red narrowing to almost a pinpoint. This is when I noticed the words written across the side, 'Roomba T-800' my grip tightened around the mop handle.

The Roomba begins to spin violently and it starts to hover about five feet from the ground, "Shit" I said. I yell to my neighbor, "You know what Henry, if I make it out of this thing I am going to kill you myself." I yelled. "YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR TERMINATION!" shouted the Roomba. Without further hesitation I swing the mop as hard as I can, the Roomba hits the tree implanting the blade deep within the trunk. The Roomba putters in the air trying to balance itself out but it is too late, I close in on it and swing the mop hard over my head slamming through the top of the Roomba. 

&#x200B;

"Lights out mother fucker" I said. The Roomba smacks into the ground and the light turns yellow from red, blinking quickly. I approach the Roomba slowly, surely it should take more than that. I slowly begin to realize that the crater wasn't from the impact but its sudden arrival, the Roomba appeared to be much more delicate than I anticipated.
