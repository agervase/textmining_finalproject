The just...appeared, one day. One night there was nothing but the moon and the stars, and the next, there they were.

The Angels.

The name seems silly now, knowing what they do, but that's what people called them at first. The first to see them described them as beautiful.

Faintly glowing humanoid outlines with magnificent golden wings silently floated through the sky. They didn't speak, there was no trumpets sounding their arrival. The angels simply floated down to Earth straight from the heavens above.

It was nearly impossible to see them during the day, like trying to see a flashlight beam, but the sights at night when you could see them scattered against the horizon...it really was beautiful. 

Many preached about miracles and the second coming of Christ; that this was a sign of salvation.

Others said it was a sign of the end times.

The Angels soon confirmed it was the latter.

All it takes is a single touch, and poof. Incinerated in an instant. Gone.

They moved slowly, floating with the calm purpose of a creature that has nothing to fear and all the time in the universe. If you ran far enough they would turn their attention to another and leave you alone. Surprisingly enough, doors seem to keep them out, but you need to keep it dark. If it's light you can't see them to run. 

The more religious among us left think that they are able to appear anywhere God's light can reach. The sun became our enemy.

There is talk that maybe the ones chosen by the Angels are ascended to Heaven in that blinding flash of heat and light, and that driving us underground where we fear and shun the light of day is our punishment. Maybe they're right, and living in fear is our Hell, but we knew above all else that we would do whatever it took to survive.


So what was left of mankind entered the depths of the Earth to live in darkness and return to the surface at night. 

We took comfort in seeing nothing, afraid of what we couldn't see in the light.
