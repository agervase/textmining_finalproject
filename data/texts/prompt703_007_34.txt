Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a writer, nor is English my first language. I just liked this prompt and promptly (hehe) got an idea. Enjoy :)  


“It’s been a long time”, Jane says while looking surprisingly hopeful, “I hope you haven’t forgotten me”. Still in shock, I watched my surroundings and realized I was literally in hell.  
 “Why…. Wha… how...”, I hadn’t managed to get any more words – well…. Sounds – out before Satan himself spoke up.  
 

“Jane here has been playing a few games with me; lost every single one of them. Now she’d like to put on a little wager. I’ve decided that we’d put a life up for grabs; therefore, if we win, at a game of your choice” - Satan arrogantly chuckles, as if he’d be able to win any game we chose - “I’ll take two souls with me to hell. If you win, you can have Jane back.”  
 

“I’ve been stuck in hell for 2 years, and I really, really, want to get out; and this was the only way I think I can. Sorry man….”, Jane says. “Unfortunately, I’ve already chosen to play that one platformer you made when you were about 16; and finish it as soon as possible, however we’d like.”  
 

Still baffled, I just decide to start the game: “Alright, but you guys start first”.  
 

Satan and death together make every single jump, every prompt perfectly, like robots, and manage to get the theoretical lower limit to finish the game. In a game that has the theoretical limit on about 6 hours, this is really, REALLY amazing.   
 

Jane looks at me: “This is bad isn’t it? I haven’t played this game that much, but even I know that this can’t be good”  
 

Then it is our turn, Jane misses almost every jump, and starts panicking: “There is absolutely no way we can win this; I’m sorry I’ve doomed you… literally”.  
 

Fortunately, I’ve always had a backup, for whenever something like this might happen.  
 

In the game, I look up twice, crouch twice, walk left, walk right, walk left, walk right, I shoot, and jump once. Then, I press “start”.
