Most folks have some sort of quirk that impacts their everyday life. My mom hasn't had a bad cup of coffee since she was drinking the stuff, and my sister has some really profound art on 35th. Mine is a bit different, and certainly has made me a good deal more.

I opened a freelance site after the information age completely took over some more traditional habits, like paying by cash or card. It's all tied to your Social Security Account now. Bills get paid automatically, and your working wages update for every minute you work. Surprisingly, these SSA's are still gaurded by password systems, instead of Biometrics. We all know that if you give someone the chance to forget an important piece of info, they will. So my job is to recover their account information for them. It's risky business, so I charge a respectable amount. No one ever complains because I always pull through.

I received an encrypted message today that asked for me to meet with some gentlemen here in the park, in just a few more minutes from now. Sitting on the bench is a little uncomfortable. They introduced these slanted ones that are made to stop the homeless from sleeping on them, but all it *really* did was make it a literal pain in the ass to sit for any length of time. I check my watch, and look back up to a black car pulling into the park. This must be them. They begin stepping out, and I start heading to their car. I make it just a few feet in front of the car before the restrain me and draw firearms. Shit, this isn't good. The sedan's back door opens, and out steps someone I know exceedingly well. "President Winfrey?" I utter, baffled. She nods and says simply, "Son, we need your unique brand of hacking to stop the next World War, or life as we know it will cease to be. Gentlemen, bag him up, we have work to do." 

As they throw me into the truck, tied up and head covered, I wonder, more than anything else, why did I have to be so good at fill in the blank puzzles.
