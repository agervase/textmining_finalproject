**NEWBURGH BUGLE HQ- NEWBURGH, NEW YORK 9:30 AM EST; 5/4/50**

"Diane. Do you have a story?" The bark of Mr. White wasn't abnormal and my heart skipped a beat every time I heard it. The chief executive of the Newburgh Bugle dried his sweaty palms on his desk, wiping away the sweat on his forehead for good measure. This was his trademark look before scolding someone... I didn't want to be that 'someone'.

I managed to squeak out a disappointing, resounding, "No, sir."

"On any other day, Diane, I swear I would have FUMED after hearing that. But, I need someone who's not busy. Chatter is going on around the town after Michelle quit her story on the Queen of England. I need you to pick up where she left off. Go to England, sit the Queen down and make her talk about how damn old she is. Record it, write, whatever you have to do and bring us back your findings."

"Yes, sir. Do you have any of Michelle's work for me to take a look at?" My heart returned beating to its natural rate.

"No. Michelle just up and left, and I have no idea where her work is. Sent in her resignation letter over e-mail, missed her flight back to the US... Don't be like Michelle. Don't quit, you're young... you can figure it out."

**HEATHROW AIRPORT 9:00 AM BST; 5/6/50** 

Oh, God. I'm about to interview the Queen of England. Stay cool, read over the notes you prepared on the plane. 

"Oof-"

"Watch where you're going, miss!"

Alright, probably shouldn't read and walk. Pick up your papers before someone steps on them-- too late.

"Sorry! Silly me, my papers shouldn't be on the ground."

She's gone, looking at her phone and not giving a care to what I just said. Why did **I** apologize for **her** stepping on my papers? Ugh! Buckingham Palace, here I come.

**BUCKINGHAM PALACE 9:30 AM BST**

"Hi, my name is Diane Mane, investigative journalist. I'm working with the Newburgh Bugle on my story about the Queen and her lifestyle habits contributing to her longevity and I was wondering if she was available right now."

Was that too much? Sure felt like a mouthful. 

"Yes, just this way." The guard walks me down an elegant teal hallway, decorated with elaborate portraits. He knocks on a door, inside a doorway with a golden border. Before I can jot this down, the door opens and I'm hit with a whiff of an aromatic, graceful scent. Fancy. I walk into the room and bear witness to the Queen sitting down, devoid of the regality I expected. A simple outfit and a warm smile. 

"You smell good. Well, not you, but this room. Your room, I mean--" I blush, as red as a tomato and in a scramble to sit down, my papers fall to the floor.

She chuckles at my nervousness and helps me pick them up. "Honey, relax. What do you want to ask me?"

I can feel the thin layer of perspiration across my palms, and the sweat beads welling up at the top of my head. Stay calm, Diane.

"What lifestyle habits would you recommend to others, others who want to live as long as you?"

Her smile drops. "Well, there's one thing one has to do... for another to live long. Sacrifice."

"What do you mean?"

Her eyebrows furrow, her eyes stare fiercely into mine and my heart jumps. "It's rather hard to explain. You have to take it, you can't rest on your laurels." 

"Uh... what are you taking?"

"Everything."

"Everything from what?" What is she talking about?!

Her eyebrows suddenly relax, and she quickly looks away. It's as if she slipped out of a trance, and the hair on the back of my neck stands up. Yeah, this is weird.

"Hahaha! I'm just messing with you, Ms. Mane! I eat several vegetables a day, I don't smoke or drink, I don't eat foods with processed sugar... Basically, I watch what I eat. Then, I make sure I have a walk around the estate every day. You see, it helps me keep my bones moving and soak up the Sun's Vitamin D. Do you want to walk with me on the daily path?" 

"Sure, I'll just... Where's the nearest bathroom?"

"My guard will take you."

My heart rate is still skyrocketing, something about the Queen's initial vagueness made my skin crawl. I just need to take a break to regain my composure.

I look in the mirror, making sure my hair is fine when something catches my eye in the mirror's reflection. It's a piece of paper, crumpled up. Figuring I'll help out the staff, I'm about to throw out the jagged, unruly ball of paper when I see that there's text on it. I open it up, with the loud, crinkling sound filling up the vacant bathroom, and I gasp. It's a note from Michelle.

*Please get this note the publicity it needs. I don't know what lies the Queen will spread about me: Whether I quit or went missing or died in a freak accident or what. Whatever she says is a lie. They're going to kill me, I'm running because I've found their secret. The reason the Queen has lived so long is*

The female guard comes in, she sees the note. She asks me what it is, and my throat closes up. I can't move my feet and there's a strong feeling, from the top of my skull to the tips of my toenails-- it's fear. She looks at it and all I can do is watch as her face contorts... into shock and anger. 

I'm defenseless as she grabs me, pulling me back to the interview room. 

I'm defenseless as she hands the note over to the Queen. 

I'm defenseless as guards force me into the chair I was sitting in, holding me down as if I could resist. 

I'm defenseless as the Queen takes off her spotless, white gloves and delicately places them on her desk. 

I'm defenseless as her wrinkled, dirty hands press onto my chest... right near my heart. My eyes widen, there's a sharp pain in my chest-- **GOD, HELP ME!**

The pain leaves as quickly as it came. But, my body becomes rigid and I can't move a finger. My chest feels as light as a feather...my heartbeat is the slowest it's been in my life. Her hands are still there... the room is on its side...darkness clouds my vision and the last thing I hear is the  Queen's low voice:

*"Well, there's one thing one has to do... for another to live long. Sacrifice."*
