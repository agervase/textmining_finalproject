"No! You...can't die!" The man with the scythe found the words hard to utter. Never before had I thought that he would wish people life instead of death. But at last, one had to realize that death is but a finite resources if too few were around to renew it. The first few, the most disheartened and pessimistic of the bunch must be dealt with early to prevent morale dipping. But convincing the desperate to turn towards life was a task more difficult than Death imagined. *Didn't everyone seek life? Apparently not.*

"I've nothing to live for! Everyone I know is dead. I have no more hope to find," said one, a particularly ragged young man, his eyes despondent and lacking its usual youthful lustre. Death knew that look: It usually heralded his coming and his duty. But it slowly chipped away at the pitiful courage that he still possessed. How could he convince them to live if they didn't want to? A sudden epiphany struck him.

"You can live for...a new generation! A new Earth! New colonies!" Death said, throwing around the words as if they were diamonds. But the thought of being such a historically significant figure was at the least an interesting thought. He could see the perked interest amongst the crowd. To sweeten the deal, he added, "You are failing Humanity now if you die. Millions of children from the future will die if you are reckless." He knew he had won them over, the idealistic scoundrels. He never wanted to give such a speech and offer such great rewards, but for the business it was necessary. Souls were money, and the running out of sustainable currency...horrifying.

Suddenly, a spectral servant approached the Grim Reaper, bearing a message from their scouts. The Reaper read it, and laughed aloud. New colonies of other organisms had just been found. And they were rapidly multiplying. Death smiled, then prepared to leave instantly. Letting another Reaper take control of a planet so valuable would be costly. But the looks in the humans' eyes were now of hope, of aspirations. Death cast a single glance, thinking about the potential benefit they brought. *Unworthy of my effort,* he assessed. With a wave of his hand, he vanished, as the humans resigned themselves to a fate they had briefly rejected.

Death always had business *somewhere*.
