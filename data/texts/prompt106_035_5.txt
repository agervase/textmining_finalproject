It was a quiet evening at the St. Marianna Hospital, lights of the distant sunset dancing around the sterile room, smelling of fresh bedsheets and antibiotics. Yet beyond the veil of medicaments, there was a faint stench of madness, emanating from a woman, tied to the bed with leather straps. 

Despite the futility of her efforts, she kept struggling against her shackles, drool and vomit running down her lips. She couldn’t help it – her brain started degenerating a long tme ago, now sending random signals to her body, making her twitch uncontrollably. 

A young girl sat by the bed, trying her hardest not to notice the horrid condition of her mother, yet the constant shuffling and moans made it difficult. It was her turn to keep an eye on her mother, while dad and her brother went to get the dinner. 

There was no pity in her eyes, no remorse, not anymore. It was replaced with contempt and anger. Anger at her own inability to help, inability to make things right, and contempt at how fast mom’s condition deteriorated. She was tired of seeing this, tired of caring. 

Suddenly, the shuffling stopped. 

The mother’s face froze, eyes resembling glass orbs, staring into the celling. The last, tiny speck of drool rolled down her chin, reflecting the light of the dying sun. 

By the bed stood a man, wearing a long grey coat and a fedora. His face was obscured by the shade, hands clad in gloves holding a vintage golden timepiece. He clicked it, and a notepad appeared in his hands instead. He scribbled something, scratching of a ball-point pen being the only thing breaking the silence. 

He leaned in to the mother, whispering something. Then, he straightened, and, without paying attention to the shocked young girl, walked out of the room.

In the next moment, the heart rate monitor’s long beep crushed the tranquility, doctors rushing in to do their sacred duty. One of the orderlies took the girl by hand and led her out of the room, saying something soothing. 

The girl wasn’t crying, she was not sad at all. She was grateful. She was finally free.

-	John, this is ridiculous. Do you really think that woman was capable of making such a cold-blooded, calculated murder? We don’t have any proof, we technically don’t even have a right to hold her in the presinct. 

John Turner, a detective in a Los Angeles Police Department, leaned back in his chair and scratched a week-long stubble on his cheeks. In front of him was the file about a series of well-planned and perfectly-carried out murders of seemingly random people. All of them were commited by sophisticated machinery, without human intervention. Each subsequent crime was a bit longer than the prevous one, indicating that the killer was savouring the thrill of the kill, rather than the result. 

-	Louis, we can’t leave such things to chance, we have to check everybody. Plus, have you seen and talked to her? She is obsessed with death, like a damn cultist. 
-	Hey, last time I checked, madness wasn’t a crime. If it was, our president would be…
-	Oh god, don’t start this again, - John sighed and stood up from his table, going for the door. – One last conversation, and I’ll personally let her go.

He walked down to the interrogation room, mentally preparing himself for the barrage of depression that happened whenever he talked to this particular suspect. 

She was a tall, blonde woman, her skin pale as parchment, lips red as fresh blood. She was wearing predominatly black clothes, but not in a way goth kids did – it wasn’t craving for attention, it wasn’t exaggerating the owner’s inner conflicts. It was a calculated gesture, showing the inner conviction – she was absolutely sure about her views on life, and despised anyone different. 

She was a gothic painting, thrown into the future from the XVth century Transylvania, her manners and posture looking regal, even ascended above others, mere mortals. 

-	Miss Amelia. I’m sorry we meet so often, but the condi... – John started with a smile, but she interrupted him. 
-	You aren’t sorry, John. You see me as a dangerous suspect because of my beliefs, - disgust seeped through her words. 
-	Heh… Yeah, in a way, I still am. In case you aren’t guilty, - John shrugged, sitting opposite of Amelia. He decided that since she could easily see through his well-mannered disguise, it would be better to drop it altogether. – You seem like a very smart woman, and you know and love just enough about death to make it very personal to yourself…
-	Have you ever seen a man die, John? – Amelia leaned in slightly, putting her elbows on the table, and resting the head on her palms.
-	I’m… Mmm… I’ve seen dead people, yes. 
-	No-no, I mean an actual moment of death. That second that separates here and there. 
-	More than you’d think. 
-	Have you noticed something about that moment? – Amelia’s interest became almost tangible. John did not answer. The suspect continued. – I’ve seen my mother die, when I was seven. It’s a click, and then a scribble. The last click of life. The click that gives… freedom. Freedom of this world’s sadness, sorrow, hatred, jelaousy…
-	I get the point. So, you consider this… as you said, this world, a prison? 
-	Yes. Exactly! – she smiled, finally finding someone who understands her point of view. – I want to know exactly what’s out there, beyond life. Why do people often die with a smile on their faces? If souls exist, then why doesn’t anyone come back? So many questions, so little answers…
-	There is nothing beyond. You just die and that’s it. 
-	No, I am one hundred percent sure there is something else. Something better. 
-	You have studied death in many ways, as you said before, is that correct? – John decided to take the initiative. Amelie nodded. – Then you know that, for example, in Christianity, there is a concept of Purgatory. A place from which no soul comes back… 
-	That’s Catholicism, and it’s a bit different than that… 
-	No, that’s beside the point. Or, rather, quite the opposite, - John touched his temple, trying to gather his thoughts. – My point is – there are many different interpretations of death, most often contradicting each other. How can you know which one is correct?
-	I have my own, that is all you need to know, - Amelia smiled. 

Silence hung in the air. John sighed. 

-	Okay, listen. If you are the one doing this, I beg you to stop. There is so much to live for – family, friends, movies, games, books, long walks on the beach… - Amelie’s lips thinned into a line, face turning into a mask of annoyed idiffirence to the person talking, like a teenager being lectured by a parent. John continued. – Don’t take this away from yourself and from other people. 
-	Are you done?
-	Yes… It’s just not worth it, you know? – he concluded, leaving the room.

The dusty expanse of a vast abandoned warehouse rang with screams and begs for mercy. A man was strapped to a table, his hands spread wide, his legs locked together, eyes covered with cloth. Above him, a machine, resembling a giant steel spider with drills for it’s legs, aimed them at the man’s limbs. At the press of a button, it would lower onto it’s victim and re-enact the biblical crucification. The moon, spilling through the glass roof, basked the man in pale white light.

Amelia was standing on the other side of the warehouse, behind the wall of pipes, looking at the scene she made through the narrow opening. She would love to come closer, or even to commit the murder herself, but that implied risks – the police was already suspecting her, so she took all possible precautions. It slowed her progress to a snail’s pace, not that it was fast to begin with – every time Death appeared, it only clicked it’s stopwatch and scribbled in the notepad, without caring about anything around. 

*Click. Scribble. Disappear. Click. Scribble. Disappear.*

Yet there was some system to it’s appearances. The longer the person died – the longer Death would write it’s notes. 

Today, she wanted to confirm her theory by killing a man by bleeding. She was prepared for it to take some time, but should the need arise, she could leave the crime scene immideately by a tunnel that led to the city’s sewer systems.  

Savouring her power over life, Amelia pushed the start button, setting the deadly contraption into motion. 

As the drills touched the skin, screams turned into deafening shrieks. And among them, there was a clang of a pistol chamber.

-	Cease this, - said John, appearing behind Amelie. 

The woman turned, her face a mask of fear. The detective stood two metres away from her, at the mouth of her escape tunnel. His features were concealed by the darkness, only a gloved hand with a gun visible in the streak of moonlight.

-	It can’t be stopped. My theory must be confirmed! – Amelie nervously looked at the man being murdered by the machine. There wasn’t enough time.

-	Then you will go to jail. We have caught you in the act. 

-	No… - Amelie clenched her fists. – Death gives freedom! It gave it to me once, and I won’t lose that gift! 

As the words left her lips, she lunged at John, pulling out a knife. 

**BANG!**

A ball of lead punched her in the chest, a red flower blooming on her shirt. She landed on her back, unable to get up. 

-	Why did you keep doing this, Amelie? – John’s sad voice came from beyond her vision. 
-	I… - she gurgled. – I wanted to know what… What was out there. 

John entered her field of view. He was wearing a long grey coat and a fedora. In one hand, he held a vintage golden timepiece, and in another – a notepad. 

-	I have warned you, Amelie… - his eyes were pools of eternal sorrow. – It’s just not worth it…

*Click. Scribble.*
