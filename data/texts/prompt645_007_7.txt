It’s been three weeks. 

Three weeks I’ve been staring at the mystery boy who’s glassy blue eyes graze the pages of the same book I’m holding in my hands now. 

Does he need to know I bought this particular book just to start a conversation with him? No. No he does not. But what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him. 

After plenty of self talk, I tuck a piece of hair behind my ear and go sit in the seat next to him. 

“Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears.” I quoted to him, and shyly looked up at him. But I was met with a dark, horrific stare that made me feel like ice cubes were glued to my spine. When he spoke to me, it felt like the hairs were lifting up and off my goose-bumped skin. 

“What the fuck are you doing, and how can you see me” he said between a clenched jaw. His eyes darting around to make sure no one was watching us. With confusion, I squinted my eyes at him. 

“What the fuck do you mean? Why wouldn’t I be able to see you? Not to be weird but I’ve seen you on this bus for the past three weeks. I admire your reading choices.” 

He looks at me, in complete shock, and continues to check our surroundings to be sure no one is watching. 

Roughly, he says, “You need to come with me, my master will want to hear of this.” Then grabs my hand and everything goes black. 



I woke up on the cold, dirt floor of what looked to be a cave. It was lit by candles on a desk, where this boy sat, scribbling something onto a piece of parchment. I tried to get up as quietly as possible, but he somehow knew I was awake and turned around to look at me. 

“Welcome to the underground. Since you have the sight, you will be a prized possession of my master. If you will follow me, we can get this introduction process going” 

If only I knew what the end of that dirt hallway held, back when I saw him on that bus...I would’ve ran the other way. Nothing in my whole entire life would prepare me for what I saw that day.
