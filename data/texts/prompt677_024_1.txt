"I dunno" Jay said wearily as he watched his friend pack to leave " The BBC news channel told us to stay inside don't even look outside or it could be catastrophic!"
"Yeah" Ben retorted , rolling his eyes"  but they said last week there was a deadly  blizzard to hit the UK ...and we just got typical Irish rain"
"Yeah well we live in ireland and anyways  England got snow " Jay reasoned 
"Yeah but it was like 2cm deep not a blizzard "Ben replied throwing his clothes into a trunk. Jay made a move to try to stop him.
"Step Aside" Ben warned shrugging of Jays arm "  You heard the radio leave now  get to high ground" 
"I'm not sure National Public  Radio is really applicable here...Isn't it American or something..."
"I dunno...its National radio ...that means all nations and  I'm not taking my chances!"Ben said hosting the backpack over his shoulders
" pretty sure thats not what national means" Ben rolled his eyes and reached for the door handle but Jay slapped him away!
 " No you can't leave...lets watch the  RTE news "Jay urged. Ben scowled and nodded. The voice from the TV echoed through the  room

"Cuirimid ár smaointe agus paidreacha ar ár gcairde Americian agus na Breataine. Tá súil againn go siad a shárú na buamaí drochaimsire devistating na tíortha. Anois le haghaidh an aimsir áitiúil agus nuacht.  Ag súil rain. Seachas sin lá uneventful in Éirinn. Oíche mhaith."

Ben looked at Jay
"Well that was  useless ...hardly anyone speaks Irish anymore"
Jay frowned "I'll have you know my granny speaks Irish and she taught me some!"
"Great what did it say! Should we stay or should we go"
"I dunno I'm not fluent  ... I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure Oíche mhaith means good night.."

"Good night?" Ben said raising his eyebrows. "Right  your delusional I'm going"...

"Noo" Jay screamed
