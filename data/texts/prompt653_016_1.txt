The girl behind the counter was always happy to see me. She waved me over as soon as I entered.

“David! The usual?” She said cheerfully, holding up a paper cup with my name on it.

“You know me so well.” I chuckled. “How has your day gone, Katie?”

Katie smiled and motioned for one of her coworkers to take over.

“I don’t want to get you in trouble.” I said, as she approached.
She waved dismissively. “I’m going on break anyway, and beside, talking to you is the highlight of my day.” She suddenly reached out and plucked a stray hair from my head.

“Hey, what the-“I protested but she cut me off.

“Look,” She said, grinning. “You’re an old man.”

A grey hair.  My shock had must have shown on my face, because Katie suddenly looked very alarmed.
“David? Are you okay?”

I slowly sank onto a chair, unable to speak. 
For nearly eight hundred years, I had always looked to be about thirty years old. I had long ago accepted the fact I would outlive the end of the world. Constantly watching my friends and loved ones die of old age and fade away.

“David?”

I refocused on Katie, she had leaned close, concern in her eyes.

“Sorry, just lost in thought I guess.”

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I smiled. I liked Katie; we had become great friends during my stay on the little island that was my current home. I knew she liked me, despite my efforts to gently direct her otherwise. But the sight of the grey in my hair told me that I was no longer cursed to live forever.

I was no longer going to live alone.

“When do you get off?” I said; the words surprising even me.

“I, what?”

“I’m taking you out to dinner,” I said. “We are celebrating.”

Katie blushed, looking just as surprised as I felt. “What’s the occasion?”

I grinned, feeling happier than I had in a long time.

“Life. Life is the occasion.”
