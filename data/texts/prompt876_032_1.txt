As I stood amongst the rubble, now unsure what my eternal future had in store, I couldn't help but chuckle. All this time humanity had been decrying God and His Kingdom for the horrible acts of cruelty that take place daily on Earth and little did we know, He was dead the whole time.

Vines had wormed their way through small cracks in the wall behind the throne before which I stood, which made small cracks into large ones and large cracks into a mostly crumbled stone wall. The boulders which lay strewn about were covered in green mould that tainted the air with its stench. I scrunched my nose against it futilely. 

"Poor sucker." I mumbled to myself. Slumped in the throne was a skeleton which looked so old it might burst into dust at any moment and leave no trace of what it once was. The skull was mangled; A long spear pierced through its forehead and buried deep into the stone throne behind, holding the skeleton in a sitting position. Perched atop the crushed cranium sat a wreck of a crown, blackened and rusted through the ages. It would have been a far more disturbing image if the vegetation had not grown through what remained of the skull. Small vines had entwined themselves around the ruined crown and outstretched spear, sprouting small flowers of every colour along their length and giving the skeleton a natural crown of flowers. One yellow flower sat in each eye socket, their pristine golden petals shining in the sunlight and a myriad of multicoloured flowers fell from the skull's lolling jaw, a rainbow stream of vegetable vomit.

Looking at the spear, dark steel lodged firmly in the stone and black wood wrapped up in colourful flowers, I remembered an old video I had seen of a hippie putting a flower into the barrel of a soldier's rifle.

"Well," I said, exhaling heavily and turning around to face the rest of what once must have been a great palace. "Where the fuck is everyone else?"

It's a short one, hope you like it!
