Before dr clef even walked into the door he knew it was gonna be a very very long day, he had gotten two emails from panicked junior researchers about a low level breach from 173, a note from gears about a particularly nasty reality bender that needed killing and one of Jack Brights “special” emails. But as he walked into site 19 his priority list had a brand new number one spot, and it belonged to a cheerful looking man in a weird outfit holding an ax. As he walked closer to the man he realized that reality was becoming more... wrong, perverted by his presence. 

Of course when you’re as experienced as clef is you know how to handle a little reality bender, and as reality benders went this thing was nothing special. But before clef could attack the entity it spoke to him “my friend, I come in peace from Asgard, I have important relics that I believe your foundation would like to have”
Oh hell, clef knew that face was familiar, he was one of those upstart “heros” that had made the O5 initiate a BK-class normality shift event. While a pain in the ass, they were allowed to stay in the outside world because the GOC vouched for them at the last meeting. 

The being spoke again “these stones are important relics that are able to manipulate the universe almost infinity, they need to stay out of the reach of the red lord no matter what do you understand?” 

“Red lord” clef had begun to piece this all together “do you mean the scarlet king?” 
“That is of no importance, just believe me when I say that we cannot contain these properly and you are the only ones that would not use them for gain that have the facility to contain them, I leave them with you” the entity gave clef six small, colorful stones “good luck... oh and one more thing, the garden is the serpents place”

 and with that the entity left dr clef to continue his very very **very** long day
