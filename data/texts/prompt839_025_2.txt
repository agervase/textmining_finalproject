The game has been over for an hour now, and we're still sitting face to face, in that big white room, saying nothing. I mean, I would, but man, I'm facing death! I'm not even daring to move a muscle, waiting for it to proceed to the next... step? Death is looking at the chess board, its chin laying on its crossed hands. Eventually, some words manages to find their way out of its black hood.


"I am very much disappointed". It raises is head, and puts its hands on the chess board, palms down. "I can't believe the Scolar's Mate worked on me. I didn't even think someone would even dare! I let my defenses down and you found the week spot. Well played", it says, with a glow in its dark eyes sockets. 
"Well, anyhow, that's a first.

_ Will I live again?

_ Wow, hold down your horses for a minute. It was just a game. Nothing is actually tied to who wins it. I just know I'll win (except this time) so I use that as an excuse to keep people from going back. So nothing will happen if I do the same with you. You are not important whatsoever, winning the game or not". It crosses its arms on its chest. "The thing is, you reminded me something I almost forgot". It's head is now looking at the board again. Is it trying to trick me? No idea. But I won't let it escape with its stories. I beat it, wether it like it or not. Man, I can't even believe what is happening to me. Maybe I'm just in a coma, just like in a crappy movie revelation. In the meantime, I'm stuck here, wether it is real life or just my brain. So I'll just go with it. Death is looking at me again.

"Can you guess why? The chess game I mean.

_ Uh... No? It's unexpected, that's for sure. I must be funny some times, people must be losing it, knowing they'll play their life on a game... Especially when winning gives you nothing". I say that looking straight at Death, my eyes not twitching.

"Boredom.

_ Now that's great. You kill people out of boredom. When I'm bored I...

_ I do not. I use CHESS to kill boredom is what I meant. Ending peoples life is what I've been doing for ever, I'm not going that way. Touching humans to give them the "kiss of death", as you guys call it, is boring at some point. I quickly found games to make this a bit more enjoyable. Maybe I want to know people better, before ending them.

_ Stop.

_ This is not going melodramatic, don't worry. To give you a bit of a story, chess is the last game I came up with.

_ Why that? Do you find interest in that? Because I gotta admit, you suck.

_  ...

_  Sorry but that's true. Unless you let me win?

_  No. You actually beat me. That's the first time it's happening. And I've been playing since 1986.

_ Why 1986?

_ Kasparov.

_ The chess master?

_ Yes. I sometimes go to earth, under many forms. And that year, I happened to watch Kasparov play, and win. It amazed me. I came back here, and I couldn't let it go out of my mind.

_ If I knew chess could do that...

_ It's not just chess. It's him, Kasparov. I want to beat him. I'm literally waiting for him to die and come here, so we can play face to face.

_ Creepy but I can understand that. Some things in the universe are so amazing that you can't just stop thinking about them... For me, it's the Everest. I've always wanted to climb it". Death sighs loudly, shaking its head. "Please don't.

_ What?

_ You will not get your life back.

_ But...

_ Sometimes it may be possible, but not for you". It looks straight at me. "Come on, you had a motorbike accident and you got cut in half! I am not a wizard! You were not supposed to beat me and get the perspective of living again".


I look at Death, feeling tricked as never before. It putting a hand on the inside of its robe, reaching something. It's time, I'm about to die for good... No. This can't be. I know everyone must say that when that moment comes, but I'm the main character of my story, I can't die. I quickly grab the heavy (what the hell, it's heavy as an elephant !) chess board, jumping to Death as I'm lifting the board over my head, and strongly smashes it on Death's head.


I didn't expect that, but death is laying on the ground, not moving a bone. I take my breath, not fully realising what is happening. So, is Death dead?Am I going to replace it? I hope not. If there's one thing I can't do, is watching people crying for their life. I won't be able to end them, that's for sure. I can't even kill a spider when my girlfriend ask m...


Suddenly, a loud noise starts. Looks like some sort of an alarm. The big white room I'm standing in had now flashing orange lights coming from behind the walls. There's also a high pitch sound coming from Death. I put my hand on its hood and remove it from its head. The hit he received earlier cracked its skull open... revealing a bunch of wires and computer boards. "What the f..." I say between my teeth.


"THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. SECURITY BREACH ON LEVEL -53. EXPERIENCE ABORTED. THIS IS NOT A D...". A loud looping message can now be heard.


"Okay. Maybe I'm not so much dead after all. 'Death' was right about one thing: I did have a motorbike accident. After that, just blank in my mind. Where am I?" I'm thinking fast, but I feel lightheaded as never before. I'm reaching out to the inside of that thing's robe, to check what it was trying to grab... And  I can't believe what I've just found.


It's...
