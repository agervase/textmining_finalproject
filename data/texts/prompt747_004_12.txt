&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here," he held his hand out towards me. It glowed with a pale, white light&mdash;much different than all of the other shades that I had pulled forth from the Beyond to serve my cruelty and malice. "Take this."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clutched in his nimble fingers was an ancient paintbrush, which I took uncertainly, still not knowing whether to entirely trust this odd spirit that I had summoned. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this some type of weapon?" I had never seen a paint brush before, and this one was special. As I held it, I could feel a faint vibration in my cold, weathered hand. The wood was old, very old, but polished and gleaming. And the thistles shimmered with a spectrum of a hues that shifted and changed every time you looked at it. He just gave another warm smile and a soft chuckle at my question.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a sense, yes, I suppose." Like most shades, his face was hard to make out, but I could see his hearty smile shining through and his eyes shone with a kind of light like you would see in a very hazy, far off sunset. But I had never seen a sunset, not in these days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days, there were no sunsets. There were no trees (they were the first to go), no rivers (all had dried up), no animals (except very, very nasty ones), but there were clouds. And lots of them. Looking up, you'd always see clouds. Except these clouds were pitch black. These clouds swirled slowly, thickly in the air and looked down on you always. They quenched out even the brightest sun rays and poured down with burning, acidic rain. The earth had grown cold and evil and cruel, lacking the faintest amount of beauty and peace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, when I looked into his eyes, I could see a sunset. I could see happy little trees, and shrubs, and trickling streams. I could see clouds that weren't sad&mdash;puffy, pink ones. I could see little critters scurrying up branches and waterfalls splashing against smooth rocks. He chuckled again and said, "I think you've got some work to do, friend."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around at the blackened, desolate landscape around me. My legion of undead corpses and shades stood, watching me with sunken eyes as I stood upon the rock that looked over all of them. Every single one was at my whim, and I could destroy all that stood in my way in those dark, malicious days. I grasped the paintbrush tighter, and its hues almost seemed to liven and flicker with prismatic energy. I looked back at the shade named Ross. He just nodded. And said:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just beat the devil out of it." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I began to paint a brighter world.
