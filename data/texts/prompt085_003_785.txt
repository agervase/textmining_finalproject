When the man hands Joey his sandwich, his stomach growls, and the voice in his head whispers *five billion.* The voice appeared one year ago, and every time he hears it, it makes him chuckle. *That's how many people you're saving,* it said when he first heard it. *You don't know why, but you're important.* He always thought that was silly, but now he *knows* it.

After all, he just ordered a turkey club on Italian bread. How could *that* save anyone’s life?

But, when he walks outside, he’s greeted by a giant TV with a crying man on it. This startles him, causing him to drop his sandwich and stumble backward. “*What the hell?*”

“*Joey!*” the man shouts. “*Oh, Joey, you’ve saved us!*”

At this, he cocks a brow. Walking forward, he knocks on the screen, surprised to see the TV’s real. “I must be dreaming,” he mumbles.

“*Almost!*” the man says. “*You’ve…uh…been stuck in a simulation for the past year.*”

“*WHAT?!*”

“*Well, I know it’s crazy. Uh…*” The man looks off screen. “*How do I tell him?*” Someone leans forward, whispering into his ear, and he nods before looking back at Joey. “*Okay. Yeah. I’m just gonna be blunt—we were invaded by aliens who love gambling, and we bet them that within a year, we’d know enough about you to predict one of your days with one-hundred percent accuracy.*”

“But…my day isn’t over…”

“Actually, it’s about to be.” The man makes a pained face, twirling his fingers. “You’re uh…about to have a heart-attack.”

“*I am?*” Suddenly, Joey stumbles back, clutching his heart. “Oh…Christ…”

“*Yeaaah. Maybe eating fast food everyday is a bad idea. But, look on the bright side—it’s a simulation, and you’re a hero who saved us from utter annihilation and enslavement!*”

As Joey falls to the ground, the man stands up, quickly wiping his tears before clapping.

“*We're all cheering you, Joey!*" the man shouts. "*Don't worry, you'll be home soon. They're already setting up a parade in your honor!*"
