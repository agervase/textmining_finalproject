"Please," he yelled, "I'm sorry!"

"I uh- I don't understand wha-"

"I love you!"

I then realized the old man wasn't talking to me. I turned around to see who he was talking to, but there was nobody there.

"Are you ok?" I ask him.

He just sat there babbling incoherently for the next few minutes, despite my best attempts to calm him. Suddenly, he grows faint and collapses. I rush to catch him,  and the last thing he does is hand me a pair of glasses.

"Tell her I love her," he says faintly, and then he becomes still, and lifeless.

Bewildered, I put on the glasses, and gasp.

In front of me stands a woman with perfect features, wearing a gorgeous red dress. I couldn't tell if she was wearing makeup or if her face was naturally that pretty.

"I uh, uh, umm..."

"Please, not you too," she says disdainfully, with a disapproving stare. I try to think of what to say, but all that comes out of my mouth is incoherent babbling. I look at the ground, afraid of her stare. "He told you to tell me he loved me, they all do," she says, "Are you going to tell me you love me?" she asked with an angry, terrifying tone of voice.

"No, I uh-" I stammer, but it appears I made the wrong answer.

"WHAT? How dare you? Am I not good enough for you?!?"

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean-" But I don't finish my sentence, my voice cuts out in terror as she pulls a knife from her sleeve.

"I'll teach you respect! You insolent child!" She screams in an unearthly voice, one that would leave one in awe of her beauty, and in terror of her wrath.

'Run' I tell myself, but my legs won't listen. I watch helplessly as she advances.
My hand trembles, and I manage to wrench the glasses off of my face. I feel a hand take them from my grasp.

"Tell her I'm sorry," I whisper, and then I set off in the other direction. I don't stop running.

And I don't look back.
