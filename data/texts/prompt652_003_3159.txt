In fairness, we started it. We thought it would be simple. A tiny planet in a god-forsaken corner of the Milky Way. We were one of the finest warrior races in the universe; how could these "earthlings" possibly hope to stand against us?

My kill was the first. The first mistake. My strike team landed in a part of the planet the locals refer to as "America." We stepped out of the ship. I looked, and I saw a palace of pure white, where intel told us we would find the leader of earth's most powerful race. This planet was so primitive that they hadn't even formed a one-world government yet. Our muskets were loaded; nothing could stop us. I took out the guard at the front portal with one clean shot to the head.

We could never have predicted what came next.

More guards emerged from the portal, bearing futuristic firearms. For every bullet we fired, they returned twenty more. Soon, men emerged in primitive flying machines dropping eggs of death upon us. Soldiers came, wearing armour our bullets could not penetrate. All of our fighter pilots were shot out of the air.

The fight was short and bloody. Of the 100 in our strike team, only my captain and I survived. We retreated to the command ship, and took heavy fire as the captain charged the hyperdrive. Wounded, we barely made it to the mothership. 

We unleashed a monster that day. We know they have some of our technology now, and it's only a matter of time before they master intergalactic travel, and come for us. They will wage war across the universe. They will not rest until they have conquered everything they survey, and they'll be able to do it. The unstoppable, undefeatable Earthlings.

But in fairness, we started it.
