All was well in the South Park community on the morning that changed Randy Marsh's life on July 4th, 2776. Across the street, Gerald was about to put his chip in to work as a Lawyer, blessed to not have to actually do the work himself anymore. Randy was about to do the same, being a geologist. However, he had to wish his children a good day first. 

"Have a great day, Stan" he says cheerfully.

"Fuck you Dad" Stan replies nonchalantly while walking out the door.

Randy angrily goes to work and puts his chip in, expecting to wake up a second later, however, a phenomenon happens instead. He immediately does not recognize where he is but unexplainable things are also happening to him. His body gains much more detail, and he is able to walk normally. He feels like 

"Holy fuck. Holy fuck. Sharon! Sharon! Don't play my Red Dead Redemption 2 character! I don't know what's happening! Sharon!" He shouts as he is transforming. Finally, reality settles in, and he is standing across two men he does not recognize, but he can read their nametags : Trey Parker VIII and Matt Stone VIII.

"You are going to need to start a new Red Dead redemption 2 game" Trey says. "But we need to explain what has happened to you. We are your creator, your god, who brought you back for our own entertainment."

"Whoahhhhh. So this is heaven? Well there's something I have always wanted to say to you but I never knew that you existed, and that's thank you so much for giving us Red Dead Redemption 2. That game is SO good."

The two look down solemnly. "That is why we brought you back. See we also play Red Dead Redemption 2. It is so good. But after nearly 800 years since its creation, our people have grown board. So we decided to take entertainment to a new level, and add real features to a character who has been the center of comedy for the past millennia, as voted upon by our Reddit community. I hope you do not disappoint us"
