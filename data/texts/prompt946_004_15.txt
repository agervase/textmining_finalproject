A sort of confused, euphoric mix of excitement and disbelief—muddled also by a fainter sense of betrayal—built in my chest. My eyes tracked over that opening sentence a number of times as though to make sure I was reading it right.

“...too dangerous to be taught.”

“A person of your potential...”

“...your potential too dangerous...”

“...*your* potential...”

I read the name again at the top. I traced the letters. It was my name, but I had to wonder if my name belonged to someone else, someone at a house nearby who actually had an inclination for magic. I looked at the address. Someone else named Alan Smith in Salem, Massachusetts. Someone else in the 17th house on Birth Lane.

So it was a joke then. It had to be. I’d never even had a wish come true. It was written by my sister Maggie. Or by Bill, who told me to apply in the first place. That’s what it was. And while I can normally take a joke, this wasn’t funny to me. Maybe on a different day I would’ve found it funny. 

But it stung because it wasn’t easy for me to grow up around the rest of them—to see Maggie and Bill get older each year and outpace me so quickly in these fantastic things I’d never be able to do. I remembered the day Maggie came into my room, summoned and exploded my pillow, walked toward me with all the feathers dancing in a fluid dress around her, and jumped onto my bed, giggling as all the feathers reassembled themselves into a pillow better than the one I had before. I remembered the day Bill kept making himself invisible when we were playing hide-and-seek, and how he didn’t tell me until that night after the game was over and I’d already admitted defeat. I clutched the letter in my hand, and I shut my eyes, and I just felt the sadness of it all, and I wished so much that they hadn’t done this. That they hadn’t written this letter. That it was gone. And then it was.
