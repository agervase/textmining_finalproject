"Your worship I believe we have an explanation for yesterdays...unorthodox message from the Bipeds."
"Yes what is it?" Grognax growled, impatiently drumming his dermis.

(the Grondorians only had two settings. Austere and downright livid. It was an arrangement had worked out pretty well for them so far and they felt no real need to change it)

"Well Sire, we believe it to be a common pattern of deception among Bipeds, in which one neglects its duty of supplying information to another and instead displays a worthless reflection of a Biped gyrating and rythmically orating. Its a form of...play."

Ah yes, "play", the fake combat that soft-bodies of that planet tend to do when they're not ready for the real thing. The very thought of it was so pathetic that it made Grognax's quills redden and flare up in rage. His cohorts flared their likewise in sympathy.

But irritating as the Bipeds general behaviour was, even the Grondorians had a certain level of tolerance to inferiors. But this...this inappopriate mocking deception could be nothing short of an Act of War.

Grognax composed himself.

"Well there can be doubt they wish to engage us in a War of Extinction for dominance of this Quadrant..."

The others all waved their antennae in agreement. What other explanation could there be?

(though arrogant and contemptuous by nature (physically colonising a entire section of Galaxy over an eternity of time will tend to do that for a species) the Grondorians' estimation of the Bipeds was not without qualification. In all metrics of advancement the Bipeds, though still evolving, seemed to fall short by Orders of Magnitude.)

"Well, no matter...far be it from us to waylay someones' euthenisation request." The other clacked in contemptuous agreement, as they clattered off to War Stations.

The masses gathered in excitement, as the first of the entities emerged. 

"Greetings from Earth", John shouted into their interface in an unecessarily loud manner, grinning moronically.

"I hope you liked our message...a little Earth humour." The creatures as they listened seemed to stiffen and take on a crimson colour.

One them stepped forward, and its choice of human output was a gravelly baritone, a slightly odd choice for such an occasion one would think. 

"Well", it growled, "I wouldn't say that exactly...."
