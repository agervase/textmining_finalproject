"BEHOLD! THE DIVINE MIGHT OF THE HEAVENLY FATHER! BEAR WITNESS TO THE ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE ONE WHO BROUGHT FORTH ALL OF CREATION!" God readies his fiddle with determination, and without hesitation he lets out an epic fiddle solo of Biblical proportions. Bowels shake, seas dry, mountains move all over the Earth. Johnny remains still, staring at his opponent with a stern grimace. God's fiddling intensifies. The music reaches all across the cosmos, shattering planets, exploding stars, warping time and space itself. Johnny remains calm. God pushes himself past his own limits, a bead of sweat drips down his forehead, his teeth clenched as this is by far the biggest challenge he's ever faced. Finally he brings his piece to a close with a grand finale of notes that brings Heaven, Hell, and Earth to a standing ovation. The Devil himself is brought to tears, applauding God's performance. Johnny, however remains unimpressed. Still staring at God with intent to best him. 

God, out of breath, taunts Johnny "SURELY YOU MUST BE MAD. A MERE MORTAL SUCH AS YOURSELF STANDS NO CHANCE AGAINST THE ALMIGHTY. BUT I SHALL ALLOW YOUR REBUTTAL. WE SHALL TRULY SEE WHO IS THE BEST!". Johnny, coldly replies "Ok." and within a blink of an eye pulls out a Heckler & Koch P30L fitted with a custom compensator and puts two rounds in God's kneecaps. "MOTHERFUCKER!" God screams in agony. "YOU SON OF A BITCH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?". 

Johnny walks up to a now incapacitated God, gun in hand. "I killed the Men who killed my dog and stole my car, now I'm going to kill the man who killed my wife." God, now realizing the Fiddle Competition was just a ruse in order to draw him out, tries to reason with the assassin. "WICK, YOU SON OF A BITCH! IF YOU KILL ME, EVERY ANGEL IN HEAVEN WILL COME AFTER YOU! YOU WON'T STAND A CHANCE!" John smirks, "Well, I guess I should start running." and fires a round right between God's eyes completing his quest for revenge. The Devil walks up to John, "Holy shit...They're going to kill you John. What are you gonna do now?" John confidently replies "I'm gonna need more guns..."
