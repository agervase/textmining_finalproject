 “I saw you Ralph. I'd recognize that sword and armour anywhere.”

&#x200B;

Ralph stared at me silently, his face a frozen mask.

&#x200B;

“They told me the stability of my psych results qualified me for special Sector Zero but I never expected this. I had to leave early after the third death.” I took a breath, realizing hysteria had begun to creep in. “You always told me you had a cushy gig. Why didn't you say something?”

&#x200B;

Ralph smiled then. A small bitter thing that cracked something in his eyes. Ralph, who laughed at everything; who remembered everyone's birthdays; who stopped to play with wargs and never had a bad word for anybody. 

&#x200B;

“You think I want this? Those of us afflicted call it the compelling. When the godspell begins there is no way to refuse the call.” Ralph sighed deeply. “The affliction appeared in small pockets 50 years ago, quickly quarantined. However, 20 years ago, they perfected their technique, and now the epidemic is out of control and only getting worse.”

&#x200B;

The horror of it was beyond my wildest imagination, despite what I had seen on assignment. “Isn't there anything that can be done?”

&#x200B;

Ralph laughed then, a sound empty of joy. “What do you think the Sector Zero Project is? We sent you to distract the Gods, in the hope that it can buy us time to find a more permanent solution. Too bad it only seems to work on the least powerful of their number, those with the least sadistic impulses.”

&#x200B;

Ralph raised his eyes to meet mine then, and I saw madness. “20 years of our best and brightest on the task and all we've discovered is that sometimes lightning storms will interrupt the Godspell and free us for a few minutes.”

&#x200B;

Suddenly, Ralph froze in his seat and his eyes glazed over. Hefting his sword, he turned to go, leaving me with the sound of his empty laugh. Right then, I swore I would find a way to free Ralph from his suffering.

“FUCKING SWAMP” Jessie cursed as he died for the third time in 20 minutes. “Dark Souls is too fucking hard.” A rattling from the kitchen had distracted him. For a brief moment he thought about checking it out, then shrugged. “Prob just the water pipes.” He began running towards a group of monsters.
