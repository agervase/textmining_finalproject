Kimberly had ponytails, was chewing bumblegum and wearing a large white and gold belt that looked like it belonged to a wrestler; the colors matched her well-crafted armor.  She was staring at her white iPhone which she was holding up front of her face, "So like could you hold those tentacle things still?  I'm trying to take a picture of you so I can show my bestie how uggo you are.  Like how many eyes do you need?  Eww."

Grey with hints of dark green seemed to spit out of the darkness like some kind of physically manifested pain or nightmare.  The dark shape spoke from the middle of the gloom in a series of whispers, like the voices of undead soldiers, "A hundred limbs in the polluted mist, only one touch gives the killing blow."

"Oh my god that is so creepy!  Okay, I am totally going to need you to say that again for my Snapchat." Kimberly fumbled with her phone.

"Leave now young one.  If you stay a moment longer, your death will be a painful one."  Every whisper from the shadows was so loud it was like a scream.  Dark long shapes like mutant vines waved in a thick smog with the smell of corpses that could not be seen, the dark god's yellowish-white eyes bloodshot and half-opened, like its own brain was filled with venom or acid, unable to fully sleep or wake, attacking itself in some perpetual torment for hundreds or even thousands of years.

Kimberly stamped her foot and whined, "Why am I not getting reception in this shitty dimension!  Its not even worth killing you to get bigger boobs if I can't share it on my socials."

The dark god sounded as though it was both annoyed and sighing, "Not this again..  Fucking online trolls."
