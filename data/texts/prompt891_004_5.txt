Tom hated his life.

He hated it with the passion of a thousand burning suns. He hated it like a parent stepping on a Lego in the middle of the night hated their kids for leaving things strewn around. He hated everything from his so called 'family' who had never learned to understand sign language because,"who cares if he can't hear he can still speak can't he???" He hated his classmates who kept him isolated because not only was he cursed with ears that had never worked, he was also hideously deformed.

He had no idea what his classmates called him, but it was probably something like HunchDeaf. Or even worse, The Webbed Idiot. The first part was because Tom was hideously deformed and had to walk hunched over to stabilize his body. The Webbed idiot came from the webbing that Tom had. In between his toes and fingers, green, fishlike webbings spread between them like the steel wires that ran between the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.
No one knew why Tom was like that, Although many suspected it was due to the fact that incest ran so strong within his family his father was his father, grandfather, great grandfather, and great great grandfather.

Because of this Tom was completely alone, even the normally kind Special Ed teachers looked on at him with disgust. Even the Autistic Children that were in Tom's classes avoided him.
Because of all this, Tom hated the world, and hated his life. It wouldn't have surprised a single person that as of right now Tom was staring down a gun barrel. Wrapped between his webbed fingers was his fathers shotgun.

Tom had had enough of this life. Due to his dyslexia and inability to communicate except through Sign Language everyone considered him an idiot. In fact many would've been surprised that he had actually been able to remember the pass code to his fathers safe, or that he had knew how to load the gun properly. "Maybe in the next life i'll be born a king, so i can rule over my peasants, I can rule over the Disgusting people and give them exactly what they deserve."

With that final though. Tom's mouth closed over the barrel of the gun, his webbed fingers pulled the trigger and with a flash of light and terrible noise Tom was gone.

*a different place, a different time*
_____________________________________________________
The king had prepared the ritual. He was standing in a large circle, with various symbols engraved around the edge. He gave the book the Dark Lord Cthulhu had given him and grinned. When he was younger, he had ventured into depths of a great chasm, In that chasm he had found monsters of untold power and was on the brink of death.
Just as he thought he was about to die, A great tentacle reached from the depths and swept him deeper into the Chasm. It was there that The King first met with Cthulhu. In return for saving his life, Cthulhu gave the king a book, and told the King to preform the first ritual described from within. From that Ritual the King would gain unimaginable power, and conquer the vast expanses of the upper world with that power.
However, The problem was that the King was not able to cast the spell written within, his hands would not contort into the strange shapes he had needed to cast the spell.
Thus, 10 years later and countless surgeries on his hands finally allowed him to preform the motions he needed. 

The king moved his hands back and forth, wove his hands together in a dance of the kind that had never been seen before. When he finished, The king heard a very loud noise and with a flash of light he disappeared. 

In his place stood a small, hideously deformed boy name Tom. 

And in Toms place, Something even more deformed then him was splattered on the wall. 

Tom gasped, and water filled his lungs. He panicked for a moment and clutched his throat. However, It didn't take Tom long to realize that he could breathe, even though he was underwater. 

Tom had no idea what had happened to him, one moment he was sitting on his chair with a gun in his mouth and the next he was underwater in a large chamber, with a single door leading outside. 

As he stood there, no floated there, breathing water from his lungs  a dark shadow appeared in his vision. From the shadow a long tentacle reached out and caressed Tom's face. Tom was frozen in fear and was unable to move as the tentacle caressed his face, and when a voice whispered in his head in a way Tom had never known before his shock and fear increased even more.

"My son, I am Cthulhu. And from this day onward you will be King and dominate the reaches of the Upper Sea as you see fit. Then when you have had enough practice using your 'Sign Language' to wield reality like a toy in this underwater world you shall join me in the Depths as a king, and together we will conquer all."
