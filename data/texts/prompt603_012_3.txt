###An Unlikely Encounter  (pt. 1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd always heard about the Supreme Leader, everyone had, but I'd never expect to *meet* him. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the past five, long years of living under his servitude&mdash;after pulling country after country under his dominion and crushing those that opposed him&mdash;no had ever seen him. But like most things no one has ever seen, everyone had a different image of what he looked like. Some said he was a slender, maniacal looking fellow, with bushy black eyebrows that looked down at you, always furrowed. Others said he was a brute, a massive figure that was almost as wide as he was tall. But the most common depiction of the Supreme Leader was of a shadow&mdash;a "human" man who had been forged from darkness, ruin, and malice.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say I was "scared" would not do it justice. My legs felt like twigs that were on the threshold of snapping, my stomach seemed to be flipped upside down, and my heart was beating faster than a price-winning derby horse. Whenever I slowed just a tiny bit, I would feel the impression of a barrel in my lower back; the guards were escorting me to *him*. I took a deep breath, thought about my family waiting for me back home, and continued forward.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, marble floor only skimmed my face as I caught myself, after being flung through the dark doors of *his* office. Shutting the door, the guards left the room, leaving me on my hands and knees in a vacant, icy room with little decor. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I was alone, but sitting in a large, cushioned chair&mdash;on the opposite side of his polished wood desk&mdash;was a man. I expected for my eyes to be met with an ominous, alien form looking down on me, but they weren't. I knew this man. He wasn't too tall, (probably about the same height as me), he wasn't horrific to look at, (in fact, he always had a kind look on his face), and he wasn't a shadowy specter of a man; he was my childhood friend.


 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dan?" I rose to my feet. "What's going on? Where have you been?" I began to ask more and more questions, but he cut me off in the same old, quiet voice from my childhood:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure you have a lot of questions. And I'm sure you're really, really confused. All of this&mdash;" He gestured around to his impending office that loomed down on the Capital. "&mdash;is really, really confusing. Even for me, but let me explain, Aaron. Come sit."

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stepped forward and sat in the chair across the desk from his. 

"Is everything okay?" I asked.

"Not entirely, but it will be. It's good to see you, Aaron. It really is." 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been decades since we had seen one another, and I would have never forgotten his face. It was a face that had been through so much with me, so long ago: running away from bullies while waiting for the bus, sitting in tire swings, not doing our homework, betting one another to ask our crushes out, telling secrets, playing games&mdash;everything. Him and I did everything together, every day, of every year, for years until...

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were pretty curious boys back then, and we got into a lot of trouble and went into places that we weren't supposed to, and one day we went into a place that we *really* weren't supposed to go into.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I'd seen Dan's face again, I had suppressed many of these memories, as most children do when they experience something like this, but as we began to talk, it began to unravel those long-tied threads, and all of those faded memories flooded into my mind.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were outside. It was summertime. It was hot, but a breeze pressed against our sweaty skin as we dash through the forest that was nestled next to our neighborhood. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, you can run faster than that, slow poke!" Dan shouted at me, far behind him as I failed to catch up.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I swear, when I get you. I'm gonna wipe that stupid smirk right off that face with my fist! I swea-" I stopped myself. Dan was no longer in front of me. I looked around, and only tree trunks and branches and greenery looked back. He was gone. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I searched for hours, and after that, our neighborhood, and the police, and his family searched for hours and hours more, for days. Missing posters were put up and the news was filled with reports about the disappearing boy.
