I quietly entered the hospital room. There, attached to a series of tubes and machines, was my brother. One machine fed him a steady IV drip, another pumped his lungs full of air and then emptied the mat again, a third just steadily blipped in time to his heartbeat. An indistinct antiseptic smell tugged at the nostrils.

I have no words for how strongly my brother's stroke had changed my life. There's a certain something that can be felt everywhere but can't quite be placed. It's the empty spot at the table, the missing face in group photos, the Christmas letter that will never come. Of course, what was so much worse was realizing that he had done it to himself.

In retrospect it seems obvious to me now. Out of Dad, Mom, and I, none of us took luck as one of our primary stats. And yet, all of a sudden, we were subject to the weirdest coincidences. Dad lost his job but found a new one that paid more almost immediately. While studying stars for my graduate thesis, I happened to witness a supernova in incredible clarity. And this one time mom managed to get hit by a car going 70 mph and only needed 3 staples and a pain pill. Admittedly, in that last example it would have been better if she had never been hit by the car, but the fact she was up and walking not even an hour after being run over surprised us all. And all of those events are just some of the more mundane coincidences that have followed us after my brother's 18th birthday.

But, I mean, it could be our own luck. Luck is just that way sometimes. There's no litmus test that would be able to distinguish between my luck and my brother’s luck. But, as long as these things keep happening, I’m not happy with this situation but I am… okay. It helps me to think of it as my brother watching over us and keeping us safe like a guardian angel. It doesn't make what he did to himself feel like any less of a betrayal, but this way I can say he's still with us even if all I see of him is a body strapped to a hospital bed.
