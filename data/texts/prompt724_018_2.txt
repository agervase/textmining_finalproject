Okay so i claim no ownership of the characters it just hit my mind while i was listening to a song and read this.

I grab the eggs, the flour, and the milk all fresh, turn on the radio to the first station. Nothing plays i keep switching the station until a static melody starts to get clearer and clearer, "it's a little dark but its not bad" i take out the bowls and all the other small necessities for building a cake, "a cake worthy of a god" i say to my self "and the one ingredient that'll make it perfect will be time just as GranGran taught me" timing it can make a cake perfect. As i mix everything i start hearing children's voices singing along with the radio,

-"His smile fair as spring, as towards him he draws you
-His tongue sharp and silvery, as he implores you
-Your wishes he grants, as he swears to adore you
-Gold, silver, jewels – he lays riches before you
-Dues need be repaid, and he will come for you
-All to reclaim, no smile to console you
-He’ll snare you in bonds, eyes glowing’, a fire
-To gore and torment you, till the stars expire"

Its sounded like a fairy tail from the medieval ages but it was catchy, i liked it and thus whilst mixing started singing along to the tune. 
The cake is mixed and set in a bowl i walk over to a old clock my Gran used for baking, "it is a clock that was handed down generation after generation, it is always accurate at telling the time" gran had said, she always checked the time on the clock and did whatever task was at hand but only after looking at the time. I looked at it and always wondered if it was as accurate as gran had mention never really understood the value of such a old clock in these modern times. It was 11:58 and i noticed something was off the minute hand hadn't moved, no, it wasnt moving at all. I though the clock had finally broken down, so much for a accurate unbreakable relic. I walked back to the kitchen and a man in raggy old clothes, a bald head, a patchy beard, and silvery eyes. I just stood there as he looked at the cake mix and back at me, i could say a word nor could i move it was as though i was frozen. "Time destroys everything but it makes as well such as your cake given the perfect time, where did you learn about time from" i was confused as to what was happening who this man was, stopping time was this Jesus or God? "I know what your thinking" with a snap of his fingers im unfrozen but everything is frozen in time still, not a noise other than those made by us, "who are-" "im someone who is refered to as many names, i simply make wishes come true and i heard you call for me" "no" i say "why would i call some unknown into my home and i dont need anything from you either leave" "oh come my boy i am a man who brings dreams to life all you need is ask, but ill just need something in return. An equal trade of sorts written out in a contract, one like your grandmother had made and the one before her" what wish did my grandmother make with him circled my mind. 

Not done and still thinking how to continue it. Be back in a bit to finish it.
