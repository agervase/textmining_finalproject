"But I haven't even seen the Northern Lights." I protest to my weary sounding family.

"Kevin... you can't even *see*. Your eyes went 400 years ago - you will *never* see the Northern Lights. You've been incontinent for even longer than your sight has been gone. We're fed up of looking after you, whilst you just kind of... linger on. I really think its time you moved on to, er, to a better place." says Jason.

"Well that's bloody lovely - my own great great grandchild thinks I should die. What about family loyalty, ey?" I reply

"I'll be Frank, Kevi-" 

"Hi Frank!" I say, and I wait for the rapturous laughter that is sure to follow. To my surprise there are a number of groans. They must have misheard.

"Hello Frank!" I repeat

"This is exactly what I mean. That kind of humour died out long ago Kevin. I think its time you followed its example."

A murmur of agreement.

"I'm not going anywhere." I say stoically.

"Yes you are!" says Jason.

"Kevin, have you heard of forced Euthanasia?" someone else asks me. Could be a great grand niece. I can't quite place the voice.

"Euthanasia... is it a country in Africa?" Again no laughs. What a strange bunch.

"No! No." The voice sounds exasperated. "It's something that can happen to old people like you, when they have outlived their usefulness to society. Their family or carers can vote on terminating their life. It's uncommon, as usually old people have the courtesy to do it themselves. Anyway, the procedure is relatively easy, just a needle in the arm."

"Easy? Sounds bloody murder to me." I say laughing.  I find myself still chuckling as the needle glides in to my forearm.
