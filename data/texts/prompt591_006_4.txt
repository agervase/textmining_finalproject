"Do you know that feeling when you have been holding your arm up high for too long? Students in all countries give up after seconds, sighing loudly and using their other arm and desk to stabalize that one lone hand, up high, to show how long their question has waited for the attention of the teacher. Now imagine holding your arm up for years. While holding a heavy stone torch."

Those few lines had earned Lucy the higest honour. Six months ago, a historian discovered a small cove hidden in the Statue of Liberty. Upon opening they had found a place for about 100 batteries and although a research team had spend hours trying to find out what it did, they couldn't figure it out. The President had even called the French, hoping they could solve the mystery, but alas. The only way to find out, it seemed, was putting the batteries in. However, somebody had decided it would be an amazing experience that all the States needed to share, so they came up with a competetion. All children aged 5 to 12 were allowed to write a prompt about the Statue herself.

And Lucy had won.

This had led her to stand in front of the huddled masses, a camera aimed at her beaming face, while she waved at everyone. Helicopters, fishermen on boats, soldiers, a great crowd had gathered to watch this unique moment. The President himself handed her the very last battery needed. He just finished his speech, which had been heard all over the world, and now took a step back so that Lucy held all the attention. The whole world seemed to hold his breath while her hand clicked the battery into its slot.

And the torch light went on. A bright light reflected in the harbour.

And nothing else happened.
