In the back of my mind, I knew this was a mistake. Not just this job in particular, but the work as a whole made me feel gross the moment I first heard about it. It was my father who convinced me to apply. He said there was a lot of security in Drake Repossession.

&#x200B;

Security my foot. Now I'm here, in a strange bed, in a strange place, with a horrific headache, and a small dragon eagerly sinking its teeth into my arm.

I can't tell you anything too specific about it like it's breed or where in the world it comes from. It's definitely a hyper-rare one, though. It's mostly green, with intense golden eyes, colourful plumage, and an effervescent underbelly which pulsates with colour from head to tail.

&#x200B;

In all my life, in all my years of training, I have never seen nor heard of any such dragons existing.

&#x200B;

Like a rabid dog, it's latched onto my arm and shows no sign of letting go. It breathes loudly through its nostrils and is staring directly ahead at absolutely nothing in particular.

&#x200B;

The punctures are deep, too, close to the bone even, but they do not hurt. Instead, there is a comforting heat emanating from them, and as each new wave pulsates along its body, a new warmth pours into mine. It's enough to make you foggy-headed. In that haze, I recall more and more about how I got here.

. .

&#x200B;

"A spongy, sopping floor and a ceiling dripping with slime. How do we get these jobs, Ananan?" my colleague asked me. His name is Agent Johan Thralson, son of Thral, and I'm Agent Ananan Glairdot, daughter to Glair. Supposedly, I look just like her.

&#x200B;

We had just walked into a small, jagged looking cave nested in the middle of the Verda Forest. It trailed off between the trees and didn't seem to go underground. Despite that, the two of us seemed to walk along a straight corridor within it for much longer than we should have been able to.

&#x200B;

"You know why," I answered, stepping out of the way of a descending collum of watery goop. "The locals are convinced they heard a lot of dragons in this cave, and we're the closest agents. Either there is a nest here the agency doesn't know about, or someone is illegally keeping dragons. We have to investigate to find out which."

&#x200B;

For another half minute, we walked, until both the soft floor and ambient perspiration faded away along with the light. 

&#x200B;

"I'm not a fan of this," Johan said. Before I could reassure him a wave of colourful misty light hit us both.

&#x200B;

"Ah," I shouted. "What was that?!" We both looked around frantically but saw nothing in the almost pitch black darkness until we looked at each other. 

&#x200B;

"Johan, you're glowing."

&#x200B;

"Yeah, so are you," he said. "Am I green as well?"

&#x200B;

"No. You're red - blood red."

&#x200B;

Then a high pitched screech silenced the both of us. After that, footsteps came our way.

&#x200B;

"Right, get your Drake out," Johan commanded.

&#x200B;

Simultaneously, we unbolted the small leather bag at the base of our backs, and both our drakes shot up along our spine and coiled themselves around our forearms. Both were black Tânverns - standard issue in the agency. The footsteps drew nearer.

&#x200B;

"Halt, who goes there," a voice said.

&#x200B;

"Quick, get your lantern out as well," I whispered to my partner. But before we could fumble them out with our one remaining hand, a bright spotlight was cast on us.

&#x200B;

"Hmm, one is red, and the other is green," said the man in the darkness ahead of us. "Answer my question, who are you?"

&#x200B;

"We are agents from the Drake Repossession Service," I answered. "And we've come to investigate."

&#x200B;

"I see you own dragons, Sir. May I see your license?" Johan asked. Then: "Wait a minute, is that light coming from the dragon's mouth?" he asked.

I looked closely at the shadowed figure, and it did seem as though the spotlight was coming from the open jaws of a little drake sitting on his shoulder.

&#x200B;

"What in the world," I stammered.

&#x200B;

The dark figure then whistled in a short burst, and a second later another small drake climbed from his back onto his other shoulder. 

&#x200B;

"Look," he said, "you cannot see my licence for I own no such thing. However, you may leave, if it suits you, whenever you want. I recommend that you do so." As he said this, both Johan and I noticed two more drakes slide down onto both of his wrists. I'd never seen anyone use two dragons at once before, let alone four!

&#x200B;

"Now, sir, there's no need for violence. We're only here to do a job. Co-operate with us, and this can be over quickly," Johan said.

&#x200B;

"You'll get no co-operation from me, Slaver," the man said defiantly.

&#x200B;

"Get ready, Ananan," Johan whispered to me. "Sir, if you continue to resist us, we will, and I must warn you of this, conclude that you own these drakes illegally. We are therefore authorised to use violence, although we do not desire to, to retrieve those dragons."

&#x200B;

"Well, unfortunately for you, agent, I have every desire of fighting you and anyone else like you that comes walking into this cave."

&#x200B;

"Right. Ananan, on my mark." 

&#x200B;

I lifted my arm and pointed my open hand directly at the dark figure ahead of us. I was worried that I might harm the dragons the man had with him, as I always did on missions like these, but he was clearly more dangerous than anyone I'd come across before so I had no choice.

&#x200B;

As soon as Johan shouted 'Fire' - the very second we both closed our fists, urging our Tânverns to unleash bursts of flame onto him - the dark man at the end of the hallway whistled again. Then one of the drakes sitting on his shoulders spewed out a wall of buzzing, swarming bugs that engulfed our fireballs as if they were stones falling into water.

&#x200B;

The wall of scarab-like beetles then came flying towards us, battering us for a second or two before carrying on towards daylight at our end of the tunnel.

&#x200B;

"What in the world..." Johan shouted frustratedly as he got up from the floor. "And where has he gone!?"

&#x200B;

The man had disappeared, and we were left alone in that tunnel. "A drake that shoots light from its mouth, and another that spews beetles?" I stammered. "I've never seen anything like that before."

&#x200B;

"No, nor have I," Johan agreed. "Come on. I don't care what those dragons can do. There's only one of him and two of us. He hasn't got a hope of getting away." Johan ran on ahead for a bit but stopped once he noticed I hadn't moved.

&#x200B;

"Makes you wonder what those two on his arms can do though," I said.
