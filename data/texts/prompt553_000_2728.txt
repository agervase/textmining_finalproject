Holly woke with the sun on her face as it shone through the blinds. Chris lay beside her, cold and still, as she found him every morning. She kissed his forehead and rose from the bed.  
  
It was a warm spring morning, and he'd left the window open last night. Holly could hear birds chirping and the sound of a lawnmower somewhere down the street. Yesterday had been Thursday for her, so today would be Saturday. Yawning, she took the talisman from around Chris' neck and placed it around her own before heading into the bathroom.  

In the kitchen, she found the notebook in its usual place. She glanced at it to make sure there was no urgent message, then she made herself a bagel with cream cheese and a pot of coffee. Content, she sat at the table to eat and read.  
  
The message wasn't anything especially interesting, but she enjoyed the reading all the same. Sometimes Chris would leave her a video on the computer, sometimes he would simply write her a letter, but always there was a message.  
  
*Dear Holly,* today's read, *I hope this letter finds you well. I've finished up the Holt project. It's in the office and can be delivered on Monday. Jerry called this morning and asked me to do an add-on print for a pool house with a bar and a game room. He's trying to talk the Holts into spending the money on it. I've already drawn it up and written the additional invoice. When you see him, let him know that I wasn't sure whether they wanted one or two bathrooms in it, so I only drew one. There is room for another off the pump room if they want it, and I can draw that up on Tuesday.*  
  
*Your mother called. I told her you were in meetings all day and would call her back on Saturday. I've scheduled the guy to come look at the furnace on Tuesday so that I'll be here to meet him. I'll try to keep him out of the bedroom but he may have to go in to check the airflow or something like that, so, well, we've dealt with stuff like that before. It's no big deal.*  
  
*It's been a long day, so I'm going to bed early. The forecast for Saturday is really nice. You should go to the park or something. Whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a wonderful day. I love you, always.*  
  
*Love, Chris.*  
  
Holly put the notebook down and smiled. It was a beautiful day. Maybe she would go to the park as he had suggested. She checked the forecast on her phone. Tomorrow looked likely to be a rainy, cool day, so Chris would most likely be stuck inside. Maybe she would text him some sexy pictures to help keep his spirits up. He liked that black dress a lot and hadn't seen her in it in a while. She smiled again and took her plate and cup to the sink.  
  
Yes, the park would be a nice idea today. That was what she would do. She would have preferred to go together, but that was no longer possible. A life together without ever interacting. A life of every other day, of a dead body lying in their shared bed, one day hers, the next his. A life of never, ever, under any circumstances, forgetting to wish on the talisman before falling asleep, so that he could enjoy life the next day while she succumbed to death once again, as she had hundreds of times before, every other day.  
  
It was easy to fall into the rut of thinking too much about it and becoming depressed. The park - the park would be nice today.
