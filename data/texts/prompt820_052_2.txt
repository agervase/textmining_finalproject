The cavern we entered was dark and musty the fire danced against the glint of the metal that adorned the room.

 I could smell the damp and dust it created a sickly aroma "hurry child" the aged warrior mumbled  "pick your weapon".

For as long as we could remember our young warriors had come here to select the weapons retired by our best.

I saw the shield of two bears the very shield he had used In the fight for eleven pass it stood towering over me I needed another foot of height if I wanted that. 

My eyes darted around the room I saw the Orc smasher a double sided axe that had been used by Araul the destroyer during the dark times when we migrated from the north to the warm lands of the south.

What should I take I wondered a sword a bow a shield or an axe.

Then my eyes flickered towards a weapon that had never been seen before in this cavern.

I wondered how it had arrived here I picked it up and turned it over in my hands and then recalled the old adage the pen is mightier then the sword.

Pocketing it and the ink pot it came with I walked towards the exist.

The old warrior looked at me and smiled.

"Knowledge is true power and now it is upon your shoulders to share the knowledge of the ancients."

As I walked through the exit and crossed the threshold I felt a rush sweep up inside of me I knew the names of plants which ones to mix to cure infection, how to help the old ladies deliver the babes what lay to the east and what lay to west.

As I looked at the setting sun I knew I had to prepare my tribe for what lay in that direction.

I just hoped I had enough time.
