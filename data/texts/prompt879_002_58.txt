My Biggest Mistake

I once did have a lamp,
which my Grand Pappy gave to me.
He said it granted wishes, 
And that I should'na ask for kisses.

I took it from the shelf,
and rubbed it to a shine.
Thinking it was a tall tale.
That my Grand Pappy did design.

No sooner than I set it down,
Smoke rose from the end.
Slowly forming into a cloud,
It turned right into a D'jinn.

"Ho! What is that?," said I.
As my Grand Pappy grinned.
"See I told you was no lie,
"Don't look quite so surprised."

The great D'jinn bowed before me,
As I in shock just stared.
He stood a good head taller,
And had the size of a small bear.

"If you could have one wish,
to fulfill your strongest need,
What would that wish be?"
The D'jinn asked of me.

Should I wish for world peace?
Or should I ask for True Love?
Or be selfish and wish for money,
Or all of the above?

No I had but one wish,
One route I could but take.
To use my wish wisely,
And fix my biggest mistake.

I asked of him, my simple request. 
He nodded his head and said,
"I shall do as you ask, Master.
Your wish is my command."

There was a loud whoosh,
As if the air had all suddenly left.
It did not take me long to deduce.
I had been returned.

Time had been rewound,
To the moment before my wish.
I had but a second,
To take it all in.

The lamp in hand,
My Grand Pappy's grin.
The D'Jinn stood before me.
And he asked me again.

"If you could have one wish,
to fulfill your strongest need,
What would that wish be?"
The D'jinn said to me.

I knew right then,
My biggest mistake had been,
Requesting a wish,
Of this powerful D'jinn.

I smiled at him and said,
I wish you to be free,
And have to give no more wishes.
To the likes of me.
