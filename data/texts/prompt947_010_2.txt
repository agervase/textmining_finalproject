“Hey, Jeff - it’s the police on the phone for you. They said they want to see you for some kind of questioning?”

I froze in my tracks, gin spilling over the brim of the highball glass I had begun to pour my nightly beverage into. Glancing down at my hand, I noticed a speck of dried blood that I somehow had missed when I took my shower earlier in the evening. Shit, I thought I had got all of it. I even double checked!“Uh…fuck. Tell them I’m not home right now. I’ll call them later.”

She paused. “But Jeff, you’re home now. What’s going on, and why are the police calling the house for you? Nobody’s called our landline in twenty years. I wasn’t even sure it was still plugged in and working. Is there something you’re not telling me?”

Well shit. There’s no way to tell her what happened without seeming like a complete loon. Harry had been our gardener for the past decade. How had I even come close to confusing the local gardener with the fucking grim reaper? 

I ripped a paper towel off the kitchen roll and began mopping up the puddle of alcohol that had gathered at the base of my glass. “Honey, there’s nothing wrong and I’m not hiding anything from you. We’ve been married for thirty-five years. Why would I keep anything from the love of my life?” I quickly scrubbed the blood from my thumb with the gin-soaked towel and tossed it in the trash. “I don’t know, Jeffrey. You’ve been so distant the past two days. Never at any time in our marriage have you acted the way you’ve been acting lately. Something has to be up.”

“Quit pushing. There’s nothing wrong. Do you want me to pour you another drink?”

“No, that won’t be necessary. I’m going to bed. Just…come in when you’re ready. I love you.”

I said nothing in return, instead taking a sip from my freshly poured gin and tonic. I had a lot to work through in an extremely short amount of time and no clue how to even start. I needed to move quickly, otherwise they were going to come for me.
