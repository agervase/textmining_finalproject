Apologies in advance to a certain, popular YouTube channel on Warhammer 40k.  

“BRUVA FRIEND, HOW ARE YOU!”

Oh no.  

It’s him again.  Honestly, I’ve gotten my bones shattered by his ridiculous hugs more than once.  I’ve met fragments of his dad’s soul, but honestly, that guy was a bit more... uh... grumbly.  

Couldn’t blame him though.  Losing his kids like that... 

Well, one of his kids is here.  His flaming red eyes, enormous frame encased in jolly green armor, and happy demeanor is infectious.  

He grabbed me and hugged me, crushing my rib cage.  I would have coughed up blood, if it hadn’t been for the fact that I don’t have any.  

“So what happened to you this time?  Honestly, you usually show up with half a planet’s worth of human souls, who I have to lead to two entirely different locations in the nether realm.  One group to the golden palace and one to the nightmarish Chtulu rip off.  Honestly every timeI go there, there’s a pile of cease and desist letters.”

“OI, WELL YOU SEE!  I ZOGGING BOOPED A SNOOT ON THIS JUNGLE PLANET, AND IT WAS VERY SQUISHY AND MADE LOUD POPPING NOISES!” 

“Oh.  Don’t those kill like everything in the vicinity?”

“NO NO MY SKELETY BRUVA FRIEND, THAT IS THE BIGGER SNOOT AND MY BRUVA CORVIII ALMOST DIED, BUT HE GOT SAVED!”

“I see.  Well, let’s see if you can get in this time.  You remember the way?”

“COURSE I DO!” He strode toward the Golden Palace, stomping around in his power armor.  Unfortunately, or fortunately for him, a really angry dismembered head head butted him right out.  

“YOU ARE WEEEEAAAAAK!  YOU MUST SEEERRRRRRVE!” The really angry skghost yelled at him.  

The jolly green giant laughed him off, and went,
“GOOD T SEE YOU AGAIN BRUVA FRIEND, BUT SINCE YOU ARE JUST A HEAD I CANT HUG YOU.  IT SEEMS THAT MY TIME TO HUG THE ASCENDED SOULS HAS NOT COME.”

I shook my head a bit, and beckoned him.  

Welp, time to escort him back.  Maybe one of his dad’s pieces will come back and look for a way home.  

As I sat down on the curb next to that tiny spiderweb, watching the enormous armored warlord stomp happily away back to his body, I looked out at the screaming, raging galaxy full of lunatics.  

Honestly, it’s probably a good thing he doesn’t die.  The galaxy needs a friendly big man thing like him.  

Note: I just marathoned Emperor TTS, so it’s kinda stuck in my head.
