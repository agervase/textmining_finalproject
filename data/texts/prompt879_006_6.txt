The golden lamp glistened sweetly, like caramel candy left too long under a summer sun.

I rubbed it. There was a flash, a loud bang, and then a tremendous cloud of purple smoke which coalesced into a colossal humanoid form. *Aha,* I gleefully surmised, peering expectantly at the creature. *A genie!*

"Human!" the genie roared. "You will set me free! According to the ancient accords, you may have one -"

"Well -" I interjected. "I already have it. Let me go back in time and change my biggest mistake."

I had actually thought for a long, long time about this subject before searching for the lamp, you see. After hours of deliberation, I realized this request was the best I could ever make. And so...

"Human!" the genie rumbled. "You will set me free! According to the ancient accords, you may have one wish."

*Ah, shit.*

"No wishes," I shouted. "Nothing I say, think or do either now or in the future will constitute a wish made to *you,* you malicious backstabbing sonofabitch."

The genie stared. Then it glowered. "Well, fuck you too," it finally managed, slinking back into the lamp.

I let out a dry chuckle. "Feeling's mutual." 

At this point you might think this is where I throw the lamp away - but no, I'm not the type to take chances. I hid it carefully. On the next day I returned with a cement mixer and tossed the little golden pitcher of pure evil into said mixer, stirring carefully. On the following day I loaded the mixer onto my pickup and drove all the way to the nearest harbor, and a week after that, I rented a boat and dumped the mixer into the deepest part of the ocean I could find. 

To this day, I imagine that furious but helpless genie still rages on, encased in a block of cement at the bottom of the sea.
