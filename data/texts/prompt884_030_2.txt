Odd. Normally, he makes much better decisions than this. Well… given the circumstances anyway. I’m somewhat of an expert on people like him. Serial killers. No one ever suspects men like him to be murderers. He’s too pretty. A strong jaw, five o’clock shadow, salt and pepper hair. He has a distinguished look and he dresses well, too. 



But attractive or not, all serial killers are predictable. Maybe not when they strike, sometimes in how they do it, and definitely in who they choose to target. They all have a favorite victim. And, admittedly, I do look the part of his. Young. Blonde. Female. Legs up to… well, wherever. We’d actually make a charming couple in just about any other circumstance. But 10/10 women will agree: there’s nothing romantic about being bound and gagged in the trunk of a strange man’s car (even if you are into that kind of thing). 



I actually expected more of him than this. I mean, who knows what he’s got waiting for me at our destination. Not that it matters. I’ve been following his work for a while… it is, in a word, impressive. Imaginative even. How he handled Sarah Kettleberg? Genius. And I know what you’re thinking. But he’s not one of “those” kinds of killers. It’s not Silence of the Lambs or anything kinky like that. It’s… old fashioned. For the thrill of the chase. And I can admire that. Personally, my victims tend to be easy. Lots of elderly folks. Even if they can fight back, they tend not to–and I appreciate that. But him? He goes for young, vivacious. But still. I’m disappointed he chose me. You’d think someone who does so much of my work would be able to recognize me walking down a dark alley in a pair of blood red stilettos. But, then again, who is ever really expecting to meet death anyway.
