There's 2 types of disposable income. Disposable as in, buy a small treat for yourself if you're in the green, say, going out to eat at an expensive restaurant, or the truly disposable, "Money means nothing to me", kind of income. I had the latter. See, I was a senior exec at a large investment firm. Managing Grandma's retirement and Little Sally Shitface's college fund was fun, but having 200k to throw at people was great. Once hitting people with bricks of cash got boring, I went on to other things. What other things? Watch...

"Yeah, a VP at whateverthefuck bank, I fuckin got it. Where's my damn cash?"

"One, it's Goldman Sachs, and 2, the cash will be wired to your account."

"Fine. What will you look like?"

"Black suit, black pants, black shoes, and a green bowtie."

Fuck. She was a tough one. 100,000 bucks buys you the best though. Now on to number 2. Best chick voice. Game face you bastard.

"Hey, it's Mark. Leave a message"

"Meet me at ****** for lunch. Wear a black suit, pants, and shoes. Green bowtie. I'll wire 200k to you for it. Tuesday 12pm. Act like a banker."
