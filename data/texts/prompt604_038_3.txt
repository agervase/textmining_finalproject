I stood before the Temple of the Gods. The majestic structure was simple on the plateau, but was huge enough to cast its shadow over Elysium below.

&#x200B;

From here, on the final step before the temple proper was the Divine Terrace, one could see the power of the divine, and the blessings of the world below.

&#x200B;

There were 108 discs, each kilometer round, that overlapped to form the stairway to heaven. The discs were very close at first, but began to space further and further apart.

&#x200B;

Until the Divine Terrace presented itself. The perfectly flat marble that one had to walk a full kilometer to reach the overly large temple.

&#x200B;

I leaned on the marble railings, intricate scenes of the pantheons were etched through the solid rock and were highlighted during the rise and fall of each day's sunlight.

&#x200B;

The winds that would normally buffet such a mountain top were suppressed to a gentle breeze. Here on the Stairway to Heaven, the full blessings of all gods showed their presence.

&#x200B;

Plants bloomed regardless of season. Fruits were quick to regrow. The intricate river system formed small streams that one could drink from at any height.

&#x200B;

I ignored it all and stared down onto the city below.

&#x200B;

Elysium sprawled before me. The hundred trillion people that formed the core of the city proper spread out for over 510 million square kilometers.

&#x200B;

Towers spired into the air, and under ground. Water cities existed above and below the liquid surface. The Floating provinces held yet more people.

&#x200B;

All under the rule of the Jade Emperor. Long may be live. Forever may he rule.

&#x200B;

Yet the current Jade Emperor was dying. The time for the 255th ceremony of ascension was quickly coming up, and that meant the trails were to begin.

&#x200B;

This was to be a ceremony for the history books as well. With over ten thousand children, the 254th Jade Emperor had lived an especially long life, as the chosen of Ra.

&#x200B;

This meant that even if only a tenth joined in, that was over a thousand participants. Which meant that having a good patreon was important.

&#x200B;

Alexander, the eldest son, was already nearly ten thousand years old.  He had the blessings of Zeus and could summon thunder at will.

&#x200B;

Ashera, fifteenth daughter, had captured the attention of Aphrodite and was said to be under the protection of a dozen heroes.

&#x200B;

Yet, I, a son of no renown, had nothing. I had no glory like Alexander, or Icusarus. Victors of a thousand campaigns to the savages that threw themselves at the bountiful kingdom.

&#x200B;

Nor did I have the charisma of Ashera, Gwendolyn, Serasha… who could command legions of devout followers.

&#x200B;

I stared at the stump of what was my right arm, and then my stump of a right leg. In the place of flesh, was the cold metals of iron and bronze.

&#x200B;

They were makeshift contraptions formed from scraps. While the food and room was free, one had to earn their worth. All I could afford was to rummage in the dumps of Elysiam. 

&#x200B;

My worth was scraps. A bronze level power that was certainly lacklustre against my diamond leveled siblings.

&#x200B;

I had stepped on Alexander's cape by accident once nearly a hundred years ago. With his bare hands he had ripped off my right leg which was  the culprit, and my right arm for trying to defend myself.

&#x200B;

The setting sun caught the mural of the gods. The holes etched into the railings showed the many gods that protected Elysium.

&#x200B;

The red glow of the setting sun was much like my heart. A passion not to rule, but to kill.

&#x200B;

Because he was strong, he had crippled me. For no other reason then because he could.

&#x200B;

Before that day, I had never exchanged a single word, and yet it was something that changed my life.

&#x200B;

It had also changed the life of my mother, who needed care and medicine. Something not afforded to a devalued concubine.

&#x200B;

I could only eke out coins by menials tasks. Glorified paper pushing for the city dumps was all I could get. A crippled boy was not the greatest prospect for an employee.

&#x200B;

Not when there was so many people who could also apply.

&#x200B;

If it wasn’t for uncle Jack, my mother would be dead.

&#x200B;

The sun set as the final tip of the glowing orb dipped below the horizon.

&#x200B;

I straightened and made my over to the temple itself. 

&#x200B;

Each step made the temple grow. Until it towered overhead as one stood before its only step.

&#x200B;

With each pillar measuring at a kilometer high, and formed from hardened platinum, it was a testament to those that watched over the people.

&#x200B;

The diamond roof was sculpted to fracture the unyielding sunlight into a dance of soft colours when one entered the temple itself.

&#x200B;

I made my way in, under the full moon was bathed the empty temple within in a soft pearl like colour.

&#x200B;

I made my way over to the end of the temple. A surprisingly simple setup that held only a round table as its sole alter.

&#x200B;

It was at waist height and was ten meters round.

&#x200B;

Offerings would be placed on the table, and the worshipper would whisper 

&#x200B;

I hobbled my way over to the empty table.

&#x200B;

The various worshippers, and priests had always kept the temple in immaculate condition.

&#x200B;

I stared at the table as I finally reached it.

&#x200B;

My fake joints creaked as I kneeled before the table. I had no offerings. I had no belongings. I would do almost anything to move forward.

&#x200B;

"I offer nothing," I began as regretted my choices. I had nothing of value that I would ever offer. "I can only swear to uphold my promise…"

&#x200B;

I took a deep breath. I could only count on the fact that the gods were anything but unified. Sure they protected Elysium, but there were many reasons that it was so.

&#x200B;

The city was their greatest source of worship, and without it they would fade into the ether.

&#x200B;

"I only desire two things. Power to prolong the life of my mother, and death to my eldest brother Alexander…" I whispered to the empty alter.

&#x200B;

I had nothing. I would also promise nothing else.

&#x200B;

Where upon others would promise more, I could not give it. The only thing else would be the potential future. Money that I did not care about… a family that I would never sacrifice.

&#x200B;

I had learned enough from the sad reign of my father. He had the power to kill any within the empire, money beyond counting, and more lovers then a district within of the core of the kingdom…

&#x200B;

Yet he had nothing. No children that adored him any longer. No love that would stand freely beside him by her choice.

&#x200B;

I was far more simple.

&#x200B;

A future for my mother, and vengeance for the weak that were trampled by the fools born before me…

&#x200B;

I…

&#x200B;

Did it just get darker?
