Greetings and Salutations!

A Rousing Thank you for purchasing your very own Pet Dragon from the one and only Dr.Wondertainment!

We want to congratulate you for purchasing our increasingly popular "Pet" Dragon from Wondertainment industries! Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your Dragon, and you, are kept healthy, and safe\*.

&#x200B;

**Care & Feeding:**

Dragons are not unlike cats in many ways! They eat meat exclusively, they love to hunt, and at times they enjoy hunting for sport! \[Did you know that Outdoor Cats only bring home 1/3rd of their kill? Dragons are almost the same!\]

Our suggestions for the young wrym under 1 year old is any raw quadruped. Suggestions are to keep said Quadruped meat to a domesticated and easily accessible animal, and those which are on the cheaper side to obtain meat from. A Dragon will gain a taste for meats it enjoys! \[Warning: Due to the similarities in Pork and Human, it is strongly advised to NOT feed your dragon Pork or Pig related meats.\]

Dragons shed once every week for their first year, and then semi-annually after that. Disposing of dragon scales is easy as throwing them in the compost. After the third year, however, Dragon Scale, even discarded, gain hardness properties similar to steel. It's recommended to make use of your discarded dragon scales. \[See our Catalog for our best selling how to book: "10000 uses for Dragon Scale." - only $199.99!\]

**Temperament:**

Dragons are terribly misunderstood creatures! Did you know Dragons pur when happy? Just like our feline friends!

A Dragon allowed to roam will fly low, and occasionally forage for it's own food! A single dragon can reduce local prey animal population by almost 5% on it's own!  Making feeding easy in a Dragon's formative years!

Most Dragons are fairly happy to be left alone and live a solitary life, but they do make a strong bond to their 'mother' or 'father' --  that's you!  Should anything threaten you, your dragon will whisk you away to safety while defending you from any threat\*\*.

Be warned: Family or otherwise are not excluded from what your dragon may consider a threat.  Best to introduce folks to your new pet early and when it is smaller.

&#x200B;

**Play**:

It's very important to spend plenty of time with your pet dragon!  Otherwise you may find them coming to visit you in the most awkward places and, again, whisk you away to wherever it prefers to play.

Favorite games are: "Fetch" (With a large stick or animal limb), "Flying" (We hope you don't have a fear of heights!), and Swimming! (Buy our extra durable scuba-gear!  Dragons can hold their breath for a very long time!  Only $1,999!)

&#x200B;

Remember, a Dragon is a lifetime commitment! \[It will outlive you\]

Your Dragon will likely find resting on your grave-site a tradition after your passing, and will have a tendency to hoard gold around your lifeless corpse and kill or maim anyone fool enough to try to take the riches it has gathered for you.  Please keep this in mind when selecting your eternal resting place!  Anyone wishing to visit your grave-site will discover the old saying: "Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, for you are crunchy and go well with ketchup."

&#x200B;

As always, we hope you enjoy your purchase!

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

Dr. Wondertainment
