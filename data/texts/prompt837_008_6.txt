"No, don't run that way, this way!" Damn idiot kid nearly ran into the basement; nothing down there but an ancient boiler that heats this old warehouse and a confusing tangle of dead-ends and rusty pipes. What kind of weirdo teenagers breaks into an abandoned factory to hook-up anyway? A crash from behind us indicated my improvised barricade was holding. 

But how long?

"Jesus, Mister, what do you think you're gonna be able to do against that thing?"

The girl was right. I had shot it, lured it next to my cruiser and blew it up, the kid she'd been foolin' around with had went all Last Stand and hacked at it pretty good with a samurai sword his grandfather- no, you know what, no time for that.

"We're gonna keep moving, we're gonna maintain at least two exits at any moment and we're gonna wait for the backup I radioed in when Jonny went all Rambo on the thing."

She scoffed. 

"More like Jesse Ventura in Predator."

I bit back a laugh. It was her man got mauled by the thing, let her make the gallows humor if she must; the last thing I needed was her brave veneer cracking. We began running again when the crashing changed into a smash and clatter. I grinned when we heard a monstrous roar tear through the night. 

"Guess it found your dead-fall"

"I wish we had something bigger than a stack of pallets."

"I think I hear the sirens approaching. What did you tell them?"

"Well, I knew they'd think I was pulling their leg if I told them what it actually was so I said I saw a group of young black men behaving suspiciously."

She narrowed her eyes at me, and I threw up my hands. 

"Hey, don't look at me like that; I just know my department."
