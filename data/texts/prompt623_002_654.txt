“When I was your age, saying ‘literally die’ with the right emphasis would kill someone, but you kids ruined it!” 

I don’t understand why he couldn’t just change it to something else. “Then Perish!” is WAY cooler and works just as well. I mean, if you say it with the wrong inflection, they try to open a church as the leader of the congregation, but that’s alright.
