*Shit.*

It's impossible to focus on writing a quarterly financial summary with that goddam countdown sitting in the corner of your vision. My eyes constantly flick up to the left as if they'll be able to see it clearer that way, of course the damn thing is projected in my eye so it just moves with them. It's even there when you close your eyes, I have no idea how anyone born in the morning can get any sleep the night before. As the countdown hits an hour left the numbers turn red.

*Shit shit SHIT!*

For the 30th time this afternoon I check my phone, my bank balance still hasn't updated.

*It's only 2PM, we're guaranteed to be paid by 3, I'll get the money, it will be fine. Everything will be fine.*

I try to focus on the report. I try not to think about it. I can feel the sweat running down my back as my hands start to shake. Just my luck to be born right at 3PM on a Friday, I get to go through this shit every two weeks until I die. And looking at my phone I'm thinking that it's going to be sooner than later. It's 2:15 now and I still haven't been paid. 

*Deep breaths. Deep, slow breaths.*

I breath and all I can think about is that I have 45 minutes, no, 43 minutes now until I stop breathing forever. Now I'm just staring at my bank balance not even pretending to work, willing it to update. "You'll get used to it" I was told. "Just give it a few weeks and it will be the new normal. Everybody goes through it once they turn 50." The new normal, yeah right. What they don't tell you is that 20% of people are living paycheque to paycheque and can't make it past the first year, and  another 15% kill themselves within two even if they do, just to escape the stress.

*2:30, thirty minutes left. Just stay calm. I will get paid on time. I WILL GET PAID ON TIME.*

Panic rising. Breathing getting quick and shallow. Shit, like hyperventilating is going to help at a time like this. And then Janice's fucking bleating laughter cuts through it. Like she has any fucking worries, she's only 35 and still thinks she has a few years until she really needs to save for the big five oh. A daily payment increasing by a dollar a week doesn't sound like much until you're three years in and can't pay your bills.  I grit my teeth and try and ignore it until what she's saying filters in.

"Aww yeah, bank account's been topped up so it's time to hit the bar. Who's in for some drinks?" And from the chorus of people joining in or yelling fuck offs she's not the only one.

*What. The fuck.*

I look across the floor to my boss's office and he's staring right at me. Smirking.

*No. No nononono.*

I don't have a choice. It's 2:45 and I'm still broke. I get out of my seat and try not to break into a sprint as I walk over to my boss' office. He's back behind his desk when I get to the door, looking like he's expecting me. Motherfucker.

"David, what can I do for you?" he asks with a smile on his face.

"Mr. Ivanov, I'm just wondering if you could check to see if there is something wrong with my pay. I couldn't help but notice it seems like the rest of the floor has been paid already but I haven't received mine yet."

His smile widens. The bastard. "We're not required to pay anyone until 3 PM, I'm sure your pay will be deposited shortly. Is there a problem?"

"Mr. Ivanov, you know my time limit is 3PM exactly, I can't afford to be paid late again. I know we're allowed to ask for an emergency transfer to make our Lifeline payments. Please, Mr. Ivanov."

As the countdown hits ten minutes the numbers start to flash. My boss's smile turns into an toothy grin as he sees my eyes flick up and to the left. "You're allowed to request the advance, yes, but it's up to me to approve it. And right now I don't see the emergency." He says as he leans back in his chair, "After all, you still have 10, no, 9 minutes until 3PM, I'm sure your pay will come through."

"Robert, *please.*" I hate that I can't keep the desperation out of my voice. "I know you blocked it, it had to be you. Why are you doing this?!" 

He leans forward and opens up a desk drawer and pulls out a folder. My employee file. He starts talking like I never said anything. "I know it's a few days earlier than usual, but while we wait for your payment we may as well start your annual review."

*No.*

His mouth is frowning now, but I can see that evil smile in his eyes. "Unfortunately the quality of your work has been dropping of late."

*Oh no.*

"As you know, we pay our employees for high quality work, and when that quality is lacking, well, so too is the pay."

*Please no.*

He pulls out a sheaf of papers and puts them in front of me on his desk. "If you look here on this revised employment contract you can see your new rate of pay. I've also included a voluntary waiver on the limit to required overtime, we wouldn't want you to drop dead on us now, after all. All of this is, of course, negotiable." That smile is back. "That is, if you have the time."

The bastard. The absolute bastard. 58 years old and able to afford to buy a new BMW every couple years on top of his Lifeline payments and he still wants to steal my pay. I feel like throttling him. I feel like weeping. I have 5 minutes left and I don't have the time for either, so I pick up a pen with shaking hands and sign the contract. He quickly picks up the papers, puts them back in his desk and hits a few keys on his keyboard. "Excellent, thank you for your cooperation David. I think if you look now you'll fine that your pay has been deposited. After all, it's almost 3, and we always endeavor to pay our employees on time."

I'm already out of the office. With 3 minutes flashing in my vision I sprint back to my desk and grab my phone. There it is, my bank account back in the black with enough to pay for another two weeks of life. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely complete the Lifeline payment but with one minute forty three seconds left the clock resets to twelve hours and fades from view, waiting until the next time I miss the advance payment to return.

I hate this. I hate everything about this. I hate the stress, I hate this job, I hate, hate, HATE my boss. I even hate myself for not saving more, for giving in to these threats so easily. For not fighting back when I didn't have to spend every waking moment worrying about whether I'll make it to the next payday. 

With my mind roiling with anger and despair, I steady my hands and get back to my computer. After all, I have a Lifeline to pay, and this report isn't going to write itself.
