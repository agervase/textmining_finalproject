Tuesday, it just had to be a Tuesday... I hate the Oven Roasted Chicken sub but it's the "sub of the day!"

&#x200B;

Please excuse my sarcasm, today hasn't been a great day, ok? My stupid Corolla wouldn't turn on today, can't blame the old thing though. 28 years and this cold front really make a killer combination.  It's not a surprise though, it only works half of the time. And even when it does, the smell inside that thing, ugh... I still don't know how that squirrel got trapped in there during the summer... I was visiting the family but I made sure to give him a proper burial when I found it.

&#x200B;

Ok, if I get that Sub I'll be saving $2.50. I don't know what I'll do with that kind of money, but I guess I'll have enough for a gallon for when spring rolls back around.

&#x200B;

I should invest on a bike. Walking 40 min to get to work is simply not worth it. Well, I could get a bike, or I could buy a new car! Eh, I don't know. I'm scared that would take some lives away. You see, it's nice to know the effect of your actions; like knowing that using L'Or√©al Shampoo saves 0.2 people every time you apply a penny sized droplet. Don't ask me why, I just know that it does. But knowing that some actions have negative, VERY fatal consequences is- Uh... It fucks with you. Seeing that number go negative for the first time, it was scary.

$7. For a footlong. That's not bad actually. I can eat half now and I could give the other half to Bella when I get back home.

&#x200B;

This power, it's made me a lot more mindful. Sharing is usually good. Doing good deeds is generally good as well. Heck, I walked a lot today, and I'll have to walk back home later, but I saved 2 people because of that! Maybe it's because of global warming and the ozones and all that. Or maybe I was gonna crash my car into a pregnant lady. Maybe the traffic would've driven me insane, causing me to pull out my gun and go wild with the 3 bullets I carry loaded in. What's up with these intrusive thoughts today? It must be the Tuesday. Why did it have to be Tuesday!

&#x200B;

"Sir? Can I help you with your order?"

"No, I got it, well not yet... Camil? Sorry I can't read well from over here."

"Camil, sorry to bother you, but if you aren't gonna order... Would you mind?"

&#x200B;

Ok, that's a big line. Lots of people. It's a funny thing, really. I should feel good about saving all these people but I'm kinda desensitized to it. Don't get me wrong, I still do the right thing, but every now and then I might chain smoke a pack. Smoking does nothing to me, aparently I'm immune to nicotine, but the rush! Oh, the power that comes from those red numbers! Then I'll immediately go plant some stuff in my garden. Potatoes are good, 3 of them equal a pack of cigs usually.

**-0.1**

&#x200B;

"Sir, you can't smoke in here!"

"When did I?- Sorry about that, I didn't mean to do it."

"I'm gonna ask you to leave"

"Yes, yes I'm sorry."

&#x200B;

That's weird. I've never smoked for no apparent reason. I'll just throw it out and-

&#x200B;

**-1**

&#x200B;

Shit, ok where's  can I dispose of this safely? I'll just smash it and... In my pocket it goes. For now at least.

&#x200B;

**+1**

&#x200B;

I'll just get the sub and get on my way. Representing non-profits is harder with an empty stomach. Why did I become a lawyer again? It's hard to work and live off from donations. It's selfless, which is nice. I tend to see some big positive numbers. I'm a good guy at heart I guess. Ok, back to business.

&#x200B;

"Can I have the sub of the day on an Italian?"

&#x200B;

What is this? My eyes, I can't see! 1... 9... 4... What is up with the numbers? Is this good? This isn't supposed to happen. I don't think it is. AGHH. My eyes!

&#x200B;

"What would you like on it?"

"However you like it!"

"I usually get it with-"

"I don't care, just do it!"

"Sir, I we will not tolerate- Sir? You're eyes are bleed-"

&#x200B;

STOP. SILENCE. RED. CHOCKING. IRON.

It just had to be a Tuesday-

"Police have been calling this the Miracle Death, a Subway Restaurant was closed after the apparent suicide of lawyer Damian Surley. Surley, a well known good-doer in the community, ordered a sub when he suffered from what we currently assume to be a stroke. Witnesses claim he was bleeding from every orifice in his body. He then pulled his registered gun up to his head stoping what we assume was a painful event. His autopsy report showed his death was not in vain, as it lead to the discovery of a mutated Rubeola string (commonly known as Measles). It is believed that Damian contracted the virus and it mutated once inside him. Everyone who experienced first hand contact with Damian over the past 48 hours has been quarantined and will remain that way until a cure for this reinforced virus is found. As for what caused it, it's still a mystery. With KCB News, This was Janice Voulp wishing you a new and safe day."
