“… there was an explosion right when I looked up…”

“… largest death toll in this country since…”

“… unprecedented…”

Sirens blare from the TV. I sit on the floor. Dazed.

*What had just happened?*

The words “BREAKING NEWS” splash across the screen. Every pair of eyes in the country – no, the world – must be glued to their TVs. Plumes of smoke continue to rise from the side of the towers. Witnesses cry and scream about the carnage they had witnessed.

“Mommy,” Emma stumbles into the living room. “It’s time for school, Mommy.”

“Oh honey,” I say, on the brink of tears. “Come here.” She walks to me and I hold her in my arms tightly, running my hands through her hair. “We won’t be going to school today, dear.”

News continues to pour in from the TV. 

In the corner of the screen: Monday, 11 September 2001.

“Dr. Wu, you have to look at this.”

“Not now, Lin. There’re enough people freaking out about this! We need to focus on our research,” I take off my thin, metal-rimmed glasses and look at my assistant. She has helped me so much in the past seven years. We’re so close now. We can’t afford to be distracted. “If we don’t meet the deadline, all our efforts would have gone to waste.”

Lin shakes her head. “No, doctor. I’m not talking about the attack. I… I…”

“What is it, then? Speak up.”

“You… you should see this for yourself.” Lin takes out a massive sheet of paper and lays it out on my table.

“This is the oceanic temperature table today – why did you print it out? These fluctuations are perfectly normal, and the –” Something at the end of the graph catches my eyes. A massive spike. “This… this…”

“Yes, doctor. You were right all along.”

My heart skips a beat. I check the time of the spike. It matches perfectly.

“Lin,”

“Yes, doctor?”

“Get me the director of the Chinese Meteorological Administration. Now!”
