Hank stood, sweat leaking down his face under the watchful glares of the judge and the jury. He'd picked law because he thought it'd be easy, something that future employers would like. He had been unaware of the new type of exam when he'd chosen it. His gaze switched from his client, the man he was supposed to be getting off from a murder charge, to the wife of the victim, staring blankly at him, as if she couldn't bring herself to cry or glare.

"W-Well..", Hank's voice was cracked and weak, a constrast to his normal confident tone. His hair was beginning to cling to his forehead now, padded down by the buckets of sweat pouring down himself. There was no way he could do this with a clean conscience. The footage of the murder was damning enough to put his client in prison for life, no questions asked. And if that happened, if Hank lost his case, he'd have to sit the entire semester once more.

"Mr Ellis, would you like to repeat yourself?" The judge's booming voice filled the court room, as if he was addressing the entire assembled court and not just the terrified young man standing before him.

Hank gulped, "I would like to claim insanity." His voice had reached a steady tone as his mind grasped at the final straw. He wasn't sure what claiming insanity was, he just remembered hearing it in a lecture. The judge frowned at him over the rim of his glasses, "Oh yes? On what basis?"

Of course. Evidence. Hank needed evidence. Only, he hadn't prepared anything. He'd barely had a week to look over the case notes. He opened his mouth to try and summon an idea, but it died before it even properly formulated.

The judge's eyes narrowed at Hank, as if he was picking every scruffy, bad thing about Hank apart. "I'm afraid I have to overrule your claim." The judge said, with no hint of sorrow in his voice, and banged his gavel down. The sound was hellish to Hank, as he felt his heart sink and his mind slow to a stop. So much for his gap year in Paris.
