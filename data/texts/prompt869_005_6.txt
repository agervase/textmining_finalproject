Day 100 after the human race moved to mars. We have made the most horrifying discovery. In a newly discovered underground lake, we have discovered the remains of a really advanced civilization. At first we thought that it was peculiar that the ancient inhabitants looked like humans. Then one day, a member of the archeology team working on the ruins accidentally activated a hologram. A human looking male then began to talk in an unknown language. His message was accompanied by a written transcript. 15 months later, our experts cracked the following message:

We are the Elfenheim. Wich means the children of El, our earliest known ancestor. We have made too many selfish mistakes and have destroyed the natural balance of this planet, our planet. Fortunatly, our knowledge has given us the power to terraform the 3rd planet of our star system. Although it possess primitive life forms, it is poisonous to our race. We will change its environnement to suit us however we will have to also modify our life code by fusing it with that sof a local life form to facilitate the transition. If you see this message then it means that you are one of our race. It also means that there can only be two reasons for your presence here. Firstly, our race has succesfully kept or reaquired the level of knowledge necessary for void exploration and we are trying to know more about existance. That would be the best outcome. However, if you are here because you wish to take refuge on this planet because you have made the same mistakes as us, your ancestors, then it is the end for our race. We have exhausted the planets entire potential. There are nothing else than rocks and ice. We have used the entire supply of precious minerals and ressources of this planet in order to terraform the new one. It was our one and only chance to redeem ourselves. So i hope that we have not failed the will of El and doomed our race to anihilation. May our bloodline continue forever more.
