"Promise me," she pleaded. "Promise me you won't die."

"I promise, milady," I replied, from my place at her feet on my knee.

"Not ever," she continued. "You are my knight, Sir Jonas, and I will not have you abandoning your post."

I stood, and nodded, as I walked from the room, off on yet another quest. I felt myself enveloped in a warm light.

I sat up bolt upright. That dream again... Every night, the same dream. For the past five centuries and change.

"Jonas!" The foreman called my name, and I jumped.

"Coming!" I grabbed my gear and headed out to the dig site. Maybe this time...

I jumped down the pit, seeing as I can't die and all. I started my digger, and almost immediately struck something solid. I brushed the dirt away and I saw her face. In stone, and a decade or so older features, but unmistakably her.

I called up to the rest of the crew, and they made their way down. We dug for a few hours and finally unearthed her tomb.

I pulled the lid from her coffin, and dragged her rotted remains out into the light. "Why did you do this to me?" I said, mournfully. "Five hundred years, I've been living this cursed life, and you got to leave it behind..."

As my tears fell onto her decayed body, I didn't notice that her skin and muscle had begun to grow back. Suddenly I felt her weight shift in my arms. "Sir Jonas... You came back... for me..." She buried her face in my chest, and I tightened my arms around her.

"Now it's your turn, princess. Promise me you won't die."
