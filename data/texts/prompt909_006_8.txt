It had been just like all the others. I was standing on a precipice, soaring above the verdant wood below. The rock face was a sheer drop. Hundreds, maybe thousands of feet down. I had the feeling it didn't end. If you were to fall, it would be endless. No bough to catch baby. Dreams are strange like that. Some things you see in them, other things you know. 

Hey.

I turned, and she was there. Minerva from work. She had been showing up in this dream for the last five days. There came the strange realization that I knew that this had happened before. That I was in a dream. 

Here. 

She said, and handed me a lotus flower. I took it in my hands, although this too I felt. Understood rather than witnessed. The flower filled my vision suddenly,  it was all that I could comprehend. Dazzling colors emitted from it's center, blue greens and sunny yellow orange light danced in front of my mind. 

You should go. But don't forget the flower. She said. 

I opened my mouth to speak, but streaming out of it came the screeching tones of my beside alarm table.

I awoke with a start, and found my bed sheets drenched in sweat. I could still make out the colors of the lotus flower, stamped on the forefront of my brain. 

Later that day, while working Minerva passed me while stocking the book shelves. She was pushing the cart with the bad wheel. 

Minerva, I said immediately wishing I could stop myself from doing this. 

What's up, she asked, and smiled. 

Uh, nothing. It's nothing. Just. 

Spit it out Henry. 

Don't take this the wrong way, but you've been showing up in my dreams, like, a lot. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. Anyway, just thought I'd let you know. 

Flushing, I turned back to stock the shelves. 

There was a terrifying moment as she stood behind me. My anxiety welled up like a tsunami as I expected her to call me a creep and walk away. 

She said, Weren't the colors pretty?

-edit a word.
