>I was going to continue my older set of stories, but they are really low quality and seem like an excuse for me being able to write whatever I want. New and old fans, please kindly not read the trash I wrote before, it is only being kept because I have nothing else to put there.

This world is depressing. You have to, you know. For they are watching.

It all started with the end of the Great War. Millions dead, all over Europe, just because of a few secrets and lies. When the great, powerful allies won the war, they were known as heroes. I call them...

^^monsters.

Every day, another one of my friends dead. Every day, another city under their control. But we aren’t talking about another Great War. We are talking about their “projects”. 

You see, the best way to stop another war, is for people to not hide anything. So, he newly formed NATO, pit it’s scientists to work making a drug so powerful, so menacing, that even our lies, something we use every day, are taken away.

At least, they should’ve. You see, they don’t work on some of us. We naturally resist it. So while those who got the drug and lived their lives in relative happiness, we lived down in shelters. Only, people weren’t happy. They couldn’t hide their sadness from anymore. In a world full of depression, they suddenly couldn’t fake happiness.

*vrooomm* 

Don’t say we lived happily ever after either. While there isn’t another Great War yet, there will be. For I, am ready to help my comrades.

For now, I want you to hide, for we have company.
