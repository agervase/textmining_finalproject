Dear Journal,

Last Sunday I found my new patsy. Some yuppie fellow in his late twenties. Handsome enough for Tinder, and from what I can tell 'ready to put himself out there again.'

It all began when I used my powers to get him a match. The match was another patsy from a few months back. Another yuppie girl working on her bikini body though *mysteriously* keeps losing her water bottle one day only to find it another random place later. She threw it out because she swore it was haunted. Her distress was delightful. Alas I digress. Point is, this young woman is so now completely full of anxious that she barely trusts her own recollection.

My male patsy had a nice date lined up. Though he made the mistake of parking his car in near a meter during lunch. With the simple use of my powers, I not only overcharged his card, but also set the damn thing to expire soon. Muahaha... I hope you have good credit sir! The frustration on his was delightful.

Having bothered his mood, I turned instead to the woman as they drove towards the date. Did you know that smartphone batteries can sometimes drain for now reason? At anytime? Such as when you're on an unfamiliar highway and using it as your navigator? Muahaha... poor woman had to *ask for directions* at gas station. She spent thirty dollars on a charger, so I decided to be kind and restore her smartphone battery life. 

I am so kind.

Once at dinner, the poor man was waiting at table. What better thing to do than make sure he found the most distractingly attractive server on staff? He's so bored, and she's so lonely and friendly!

Now all I need to do is add a rusty nail beneath the table. A romantic evening is *never* complete without a Tetanus shot.

Why do I do this? Because I'm *eeeeeeevil* and because *I can!* muahahaha...
