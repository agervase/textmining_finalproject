I got up to pour another vodka on ice while the code was compiling. This was the end of doing the laundry and scrubbing the toilet and making the bed and.... pouring my own vodka! I put the vodka down and practically waltzed back to the garage. My little helper would be perfect this time. No more pouring vodka in the toilet. No more dishes in the laundry machine. *Perfect* this time.

Google had updated their inference engine on Friday. The optimizations to abductive reasoning meant a 45% reduction in CPU requirements, meaning this piece of shit on wheels now had enough brain power to know the difference between vodka and draino. No more draino on ice.

The code compiled. The unit tests passed. The integration tests passed. I uploaded my work and put my feet up on my desk. I wonder what Teagan is doing right now... I wonder how she'll react to me posting a video to Instagram of a robot making me a drink and then setting our wedding photos on fire. She always said I was *obsessed* with my robots. It's not an obsession, I am just passionate about my work. Not that she had a passionate bone in her body. She was cold like-

***Beep***

The program had uploaded. The clunky old robotics whirred and hummed as the metal came to life. I can't borrow the good stuff from office or they get suspicious. Teagan hated it when I borrowed things from the office. She called it stealing! It's not stealing if I intend to give it back.... she doesn't understand! T2 will understand. I programmed my sense of morality into it.

"T2, make me a vodka on ice."

***Beep***

And off it went, to the kitchen. No matter what it was in that cup that T2 brought back to me, I would drink it all.

Morning came and my head was splitting.

"T2 fetch me an Advil and a glass of water."

***Beep***

I started to wish I didn't get lazy with the audio interface. Maybe I'll give her a voice in the future. Something pleasant and charming. I started to wonder how to synthesize the vocal opposite of Teagan's voice as I drank my water and Advil and left to explain to my manager why I'm late for work and smell like vodka.

"T2 clean this place up while I'm gone."

***Beep***

Teagan was *not* happy about the wedding photos. T2 was a major success! Weeks of living together and not a single draino incident. My apartment is the cleanest it's ever been. I'm eating better. I'm well rested. I'm feeling good. I'm even leaving for work on time today!

"T2 pass me my lunch!" I command as I tie my shoes.

***Beep***

"Thank you my beautiful little helper."

***Beep***

Another sunny day too. Life is good. "T2, do what you gotta do!" I say as I skip out the door.

................. ***Beep***

T2 has left me.

In its place, a pale comparison. T2 had "borrowed" some older spare parts and assembled a new helper for me. "Do what you gotta do?" What was I thinking? Such imprecision in my instruction. I should have known it would end like this. I'm not destined for happiness. Am I so repulsive that even my creations are eager to leave me? All good things will leave me in the end.

"T3 fetch me a vodka on ice."

......***Boop***

And off it went, to the kitchen. Once again, no matter what it was in that cup that T3 brought back to me, I would drink it all.
