"You see it? That is what I crave. The Rajpank of Avoothenkor."

"That's what you want? That's why I'm here?"

"With that I could rule this World. But I cannot have it, for it is not mine."

"So there's guards, cameras, lasers? What's the deal?"

"I don't understand."

"What's guarding it? You know, the security? I don't want to get roughed up or arrested or anything." I could see his confusion. "What's to stop you taking it?"

"I cannot take it. It is not mine."

Was that anger in his voice? They're all so weird and calm around here I just didn't know.

I stepped forward. Nothing. Looked around, reached out a hand, another look. What the fuck is up with this place? I passed the rock to my new friend.

"There you go."

"How did you do that?"

"Like this" I grabbed the rock from him, tossed it in the air a couple of times and then passed it back.

"God forgive me. What Stygian power is this? By what demonic force, by what heaven banished treachery do you control the fates of man and mete out of this global dominion with the ease and abandon of a careless god? What have I done? Have I gained so much and lost myself? No, their praise shall be my balm and my power the tonic to ease the pains of my troubled soul."

"Well, good luck with that and everything, but this place is freaking me out. When can you send me back? You said you'd send me back when we were done."

"Yes. But I may have need of your powers in the future. Here, take this as a sign of my gratitude." He reached into his satchel and pulled out a small round orange object and handed it to me.

With a faint pop I was back at Cheryl's retirement party. Steve noticed me appear in a corner. "Hey," he asked, "where'd you get that orange?"
