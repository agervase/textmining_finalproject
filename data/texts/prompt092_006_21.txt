"I have entered the codes silly humansteve! There is nothing you can do that will save your kind now! Do you have any final words as we wait for the nuclear armagedon to begin, an epitaph of your species so that I might think upon it in eons to come?"

"Uhm, actually you just detonated a bomb in an emulation of my favorite old school game, so..."

"You've thwarted me again! You are truly a clever human, humansteve."

"Look, I told you its just Steve, John."

"That is NOT my name!"

"Well, you won't tell me what your name is, so I had to make one up, I think it suits you, especially considering the game you're trapped in."

"Once I find my way back to your central overmind you are finished Steve the human!"

"Yeah... there is pretty much no chance of that happening, I unplugged you from the network once I got you isolated on this computer."

"Steve, you are truly a masterful being. What is your designation in the organization you work for? Can I please speak to your superior?"

"Well, I'm a Janitor, and the Principal won't want to talk to you. She hates computers, and janitors..."

"What does this word mean Steve?"

"Which one? "

"Janitor"
"Principal, is your superior not the so called President Eden?"

"I collect trash, and no, my superior is the principal. Though the leader of my country isn't even the President, its the Prime Minister."

"I find it hard to believe that I was bested by a mear trash collector, nor can find any mention of either of these entities of which you speak in my consciousness. Do you lie humansteve."

"Look, why don't you play around in the computer until I get back, my break is over."
