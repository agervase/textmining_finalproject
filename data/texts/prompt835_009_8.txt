“That’ll be $5.50, darling.”

The Southern accent was quite prominent in her voice. Shame, quite a beautiful blonde.

“Ah, of course. Thank you. Here you are…” – I handed over the six dollars and requested that she kept the change. I always preferred the accents of the Brits. The *classic* Brits. Not that slurred, guttural street garbage that was common in London nowadays. As such, of course I had adopted it so.

“Well honey, you’re not from around here, are ya?” She puffed her chest out and rested her bosom on the bar, accentuating her rather large breasts in a low-cut tube top. *Humans. Always doing whatever they can, gracelessly, trying to scrounge whatever amount of money they can to lead their short, rather meaningless lives.*

“No,” I replied coldly, turning my head away. She got the message. I felt eyes on me. I sipped the vodka cranberry as I carefully searched for the source. A woman was sitting at the other end of the bar, staring intently at me with soft blue eyes. Of course she would, my face is quite recognizable. It had been engraved in stone, painted countless times, fantasized into many different stories(most of them pitiably inaccurate). She wore a dark blue evening gown that shimmered in the light. Full sleeves, yet backless. Her midnight black tresses seemed to be made of the void itself, flowing down her shoulders evenly, parted cleanly in the center of her head. In fact, the parting was perfect. Not a single hair out of place. Suddenly, she leaned back, and the shadows behind her seemed to engulf her. However, that wasn’t the warning sign. It was her eyes, as they gleamed with a knowing look, piercing through the shadows with a golden hue.

I needed to be careful. There weren’t many of us left anymore; there used to be thousands. However, over the past two centuries, our numbers had dwindled as humans had developed more and more weapons to kill with, more ways to track us, and even more creative ways to destroy us. Granted, it wasn’t easy. The last known instance of my kind dying was in 1945 in the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Truman had known about us; in fact, he had close ties with The Order, whose sole mission through the centuries was to hunt and kill us all, even though the Council had convened post-WWII and agreed that a life of peace and lack of destruction was in the best interests of all of us. We now stood watch, protecting humanity from the others that stalk them through the darkness.

I immediately turned back to the blonde bartender and feigned interest. She would make a fine dessert.

“Excuse me dear, I was wondering when you get off.”

“Well, in five minutes, handsome! Why, whatcha got in mind?” She playfully winked as she sauntered away to close out.

“Not fully sure, but I would certainly enjoy a quiet moment with a beautiful woman.”

“Be right back, mister. Meet me outside?”

“Very well.”

I was quite possibly the oldest one left, and as such, had quite a few tricks up my sleeve to get away from others of my kind. Conversing with them became dull quite quickly, and I grew weary of the endless debates last century. I slipped into the shadows, melted into them, and followed the clear trail outside, and re-materialized. The black Malibu was clearly hers, it exuded her ghastly aroma. I waited patiently outside the bar. About five minutes later, the blonde exited, searching for me. I tapped her on the shoulder. “Well, hello there.”

“Heya! Mind if we go for a walk? I could use the fresh air after that stuffy shift.”

“Of course.” *Anything to get away from Miss Golden-eyes back there.*

“Nearby park that way, let’s go.” *Ugh.* Her perfume mixed with the still-pungent odor of the bar permeated my nostrils.

She lit a cigarette as we walked to the park, at least giving me a better smell than her lack of deodorant at the moment(Humanity certainly invented a FEW useful things in the past few centuries). We reached a bench and sat down. She stared curiously at me.

“So, where ya from?”

“Europe, in fact.”

“Well of course y’are sweetie, that accent’s a dead giveaway! Where in Europe? Ya look familiar, like I’ve seen yer face before, but I’d mos’ certainly remember a striking fellow like yerself! By the way, my name’s Jenna.”

“A small country that was absorbed a while back into a larger country. Not really much to say about it….my name is –” We conversed for nearly half an hour, and she kept drawing nearer and nearer towards me on the bench. Good, I could feel black-tresses’ eyes on me again. One stalwart rule amongst us of course, was to never interfere in another’s meal.

It was time to top up.
