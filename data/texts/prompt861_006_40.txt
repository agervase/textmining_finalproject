I pull up to the McDonald's drive thru and order my usual coffee for the morning. As the cashier hands it to me I can feel the heat through the cup. The dang lid isn't on right, keeps popping off, perhaps it's poor design? Who tests out these cups anyway? I go park to adjust the cup and get the lid properly back on. As I'm fiddling with the cup the lid just won't seal then just as I think I got it I must have exerted too much force and he whole cup spilled over onto my lap. 

The pain was excruciating and instant. My crotch was on fire, as were my thighs. I tried to take my pants off but it's as if they melted to my skin. I call for an ambulance and get rushed to the hospital, which naturally is quite crowded. They give me drugs and ointment for the pain while they spend hours trying to take my pants off. I need skin grafted back on, and am in the hospital for over a month recovering as there is no one to care for me, as my daughter tragically died from a peanut allergy years earlier. 

I take a second mortgage to pay for medical costs, however I'm unable to really move or work for 2 years. As the bills pile high I'm not even able to use my savings to make the minimum payments anymore and am evicted. I go to a few shelters but mostly live on the streets, it still hurts as I walk around but that's become one of many problems now. 

As I beg on the boulevard between some businesses, what I've been reduced to now, someone comes along and gives me a coffee from McDonald's, placing it by my feet. I stare at it intently, waiting for it to cool.
