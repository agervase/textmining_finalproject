It's my 80th birthday today. 

&#x200B;

I wake up early as I usually do, my bladder urgently signaling my brain that the dam is going to burst. After a blind stumble (what used to be a confident strut, mind you) to the bathroom and a piss, the robe comes on and I make my way downstairs to my waiting wife. 

&#x200B;

She's already dressed. She wears less makeup now than she did when she was 30, and is lovelier for it. She aged better than me as a result of vigorous diet and exercise, something I could never quite get behind. She smiles at me like she doesn't see the stubborn sack of fat that settled between my hips in my early 40's, and I'm grateful for it. "What would you like to do today?" she asks, hopping more nimbly than I could dream to from her wooden stool. My hand moves to my throat- a reflexive response to being put on the spot. I act as if I have an itch and scratch into a few days' worth of stubble. "Ah..." I say, hesitant. The truth is at this age birthdays are a reminder that you are speeding toward death. Time moves faster. My body decays more rapidly. Even as I stand here, now affectionately rubbing my wife's back, there's dull pain in most of my joints. I want to stay home and have a quiet dinner with her and put on a television program. I know that my wife would consider this selfish and is constantly on my case to make myself more available to our children and grandchildren. My lips purse while I'm getting my raisin bran and she can't see. "What about a little family dinner at Katie's place?" I say, referring to our second child's home. Bea, my wife, smiles, and for a moment I forget my aching body. "That sounds wonderful," she says, and I know that she's been planning it all along. In moments she's kissing me on the cheek, gathering her things, and is out the door with a "Call if you need anything, I'm going to help her set up!"

 There's nothing left to do but chuckle, shake my head, and eat my breakfast. With a few moments of peace I have time to get some chores done I've been putting off for a while. I fix a door latch. Replace the filter on the kitchen sink. Trim the dog's nails. When you're young you don't think of the maintenance required for your dreams. In your mind you see a picket fence that always stays white, a wife that always stays happy, dogs that stay happy and young. You are quickly disabused of these notions. Eventually you are trapped by your dreams, and wonder if they were worthy goals all along. "Did I really want three children?" you ask yourself, thinking perhaps of the daughter you can't talk to or the son that sneers when he sees you. I wonder to myself, even now, if this is the life I really wanted. The bitterness has increased exponentially over the last couple of decades. 

&#x200B;

Eventually I get dressed for dinner and make my way to my daughter's house. My firstborn had always been a loner. Even now he lives in a big city far from our rural outcropping in an apartment alone. Whatever clever doodad I have now sometimes shows me a picture of him, usually alone, usually a drink in his hand, staring peacefully out over some ocean. My daughter, however, immediately wanted a family. She barely made it through college before she found The One, and married him six months after graduation. She wasted no time at all getting pregnant, but by the time the second child came along we could tell that while she had grand ambitions for supporting them, she might need a little help. Our third daughter, having gone to school and then immediately into a graduate program, was out of the picture and unlikely to move back home, so we switched homes with our daughter, son in law, and their children. We took their modest condo and they took the sprawling Victorian I had inherited from my parents. The self-driving car ambled slowly along the drive, but every meter we passed made me more tense in my seat. Car after car lined the drive. Some I recognized, family and close friends, but even more I could only hazard a guess at. 

&#x200B;

Shaken, I was deposited on the wraparound porch, my heart pounding rapidly. Acting more bravely than I felt, I flung the front door open and was greeted by the whooping and well wishing of every colleague, friend, family member, and associate I had made in my life. Eventually my eyes found my wife, still a stone-cold knockout in a floor-length black dress. I offered a playful scowl and she laughed, the sound filling the large foyer and dining area the party was being held in. Despite the deep introversion I have maintaned over my life, I still managed to accumulate a lot of people whom I can spend a pleasurable evening mingling with. The wine flowed, the appetizers served were all my favorites, I was a little perplexed not to see a cake, especially considering it was my birthday. 

&#x200B;

All wonderful parties eventually achieve a natural "lull" in conversation and enchantment. The trick is to end them here before everyone becomes tired and impatient. The evening reached that point without candles or an embarrassing song, and I was grateful. Sensing the lull, my daughter appeared as if by magic and shot me a sly smile. "Everyone, thank you for coming. This has been a wonderful party for a wonderful man. We've had the luck of 80 years of getting to know him, here's hoping for 80 more!" she cheered, leading a toast with champagne handed to her by a deft waiter. "If everyone could join me in the kitchen I have time for one last surprise." she said, grinning like a fool now. She ushered us all into the kitchen, a tight squeeze despite the generous space, and eventually I made my way to the center of the gasps and "awwws." I clutched my throat, stunned, mentally the years and decades melting away. 

	

On a small white table, one familiar to me as my own hands, was a cake and a photograph. The photograph was me, 70 years earlier, a cake identical to the one sitting on this very same table was visible. I swallowed hard, the memories of that party hitting me like an icy wave. My friends were there... My mama... I had begged for... god damn it, what was the gift? I wrack my brain as I take a seat at the table, the very same square foot I had occupied on the same day 70 years ago... "Where did you find this table?" I asked, trying to act normal while my mind was spinning. My daughter doesn't hear me, there's a flurry of activity, the song we all know, laughing, clapping, an artificial smile plastered on my face. The second I let my mind focus briefly on the song I remember. I remember the gift I had begged for... It was a new thing. Better virtual reality. You were supposed to be able to hardly feel them and the graphics were supposed to be hyper realistic. I start to laugh. Hysterical, manic laughter. I'm crying now, too, crying because I know the choice I have to make. Do I leave them? Do I get another chance? Everyone starts to look at me, and I start to scream. My gnarled, aged, fingers move up, how could I not have noticed this before now... how long have I been ignoring this pressure on my eyes and temples? I rip the glasses off and throw them across the room where they shatter on impact on the same sturdy wooden counter top that had just been obstructed by a room full of people. I look down at my hands, finding them fleshy pink and small, then up at the kitchen now empty, save for my mother and father.
