**EDIT: After you scroll down half an entire page of comments, here's something a little brighter.**

I yawned as I stretched myself awake as the morning rays hit my forehead.

*It's going to be a good day.*

I smiled as I hopped out of bed and collapsed under my weight.

*That's right.  I barely have any strength.*

I carefully pulled myself up as I slowly made my way over to the restroom.  I began to wash my wash as I took another glace at the mirror.  I knew the phrases 'a face only a mother could love' would apply to me, but there had to be a limit.

"Maybe I should have put a couple of points into looks," I muttered to myself as I dried hands, "It wouldn't hurt."

I made my way into the kitchen and took a sniff of the air.  The sweet aroma is a steak and spaghetti hit my nose like an anvil as I ran to the fridge.  Inside, a juicy steak and a bowl of spaghetti sat in front of me.  

*My two favorite foods.*

I grabbed the note Mom had left and read it aloud:

"The grocers gave us free steaks and pasta yesterday.  Thought  you would enjoy it.  Lucky you."

"Oh hell yea," I muttered as I set down the food on the table, "I'm fucking hungry."

I went up to the cabinets and began to look for.... what was I looking for?

Spoons.... no.

Knives... yes.

Bowl?  Plate?  Sugar?

It took me several seconds before I realized what I had needed.

*God, I'm pretty dumb.*

I finished my meal as I looked at the clock.   It was a Saturday and the time read 10:15am (luckily for me, it was a digi... digit... a digit clock).  I grabbed a light sweater and ran outside.

Watering the hedges was the exact reason I had tossed my points into luck.

Samantha Hems.

A hot young single mom.  She was only twenty-three, but her bodacious curves echoed through my head every evening as her womanly charms seemed to exceed that of any model I've seen.  Her silky blonde hair waved through the air as her pale skin shone with the morning sunlight.  She was wearing a sundress that seemed one size too small on her as I felt my body grow warm.

"Hey Chris!" she called out, "How are you?"

*This is it.  Time to prove my luck.*

I slowly walked up to her and gulped.  The only thing that stood between us was a foot of hedges.

"Chris?"

"Ms. Hems," I slowly began as I looked her in the eye, "I'm not going to beat around the bush.  I'm in love with you, and I want to... I want to have..."

I blushed as I looked down.

*What the fuck is the matter with me?  What was that word?*

Samantha looked awkwardly at me.

"Chris Park," she whispered, "Did you want to have sex with me?"

"Yes!" I blurted out mindlessly, "That was it!"

I instantly fell silent realizing my desperation was out of control.  

*Fuck fuck fuck!  I knew I should have put some points in charisma!*

I felt a sharp pain as Samantha had grabbed my shirt collar and dragged me towards her.  Her face less than an inch away as I smelled a soft perfume coming from her.

*God, she smells so nice.*

"Chris," she muttered, "You are the ugliest piece of shit I've ever seen..."

I frowned.

But her face went right up to mine as her tongue began to explore my mouth.  I was shocked as our saliva began to exchange.  Through what seemed an eternity, her tongue had led mine through a tango of lust.  A drip of saliva fell on my chin as my eyes widened in shock.

"What..." I gasped for breath as she let go.

"And I **LOVE** ugly pieces of shit," she grinned at me as she pushed me away, "Give me five minutes and come through the back." 

She began to walk away as I slowly regained my senses.

"Wait wait!" I called after her, "You and I are going to sexing?"

She looked back and raised an eyebrow.

"Sure, we'll be sexing."
