The arena was fairly ramshackle, which didn't seem to fit with the whole "angelic judgement" vibe. Scia looked around as she traversed the corridors underneath the battleground, where voices could be heard screaming in an uproar. 


"You'd think they'd've at least given the place a facelift." She murmured.


"Scia Orioso, please make your way to the Arena Gates."



Judgement day.



An angel greeted Scia at the gate.


"Hello, my child." the angel grinned. "What will your weapon of choice be? Will you select the flamethrower? The grenades? The water hose? Perhaps the net?"


Scia had a brainwave. "You wouldn't happen to have a gun for this, would you?"


"I... Why? That's almost the worst weapon for this!" 


"C'mon dude, throw us a bone."


"...Good luck, child of God."


Scia shot herself in the head.





"...Ow...My head..."


"That was reckless."


Scia looked up. Standing over her was an archangel. Gabriel? Michael? She could not remember his name.


"I have good news and bad news. Which will you hear first?"


"The good news."


"You committed suicide. While I had the power to bring you back, it was not a simple fix. I had to erase your sins and purify you first. Which means..."


"I don't need to fight the bugs! Haha! I knew the plan would work!"


The angel smiled wryly, before his expression hardened.


"Ingenious. It's a shame about the bad news though. Suicide is a cardinal sin; unremovable. And the punishment for that sin is being sent to hell."


Scia's euphoria faded.


"...So..."

"I pray Lucifer will have mercy on your soul. Although, with his sick, twisted mind, he probably plans on making you fight those creatures anyway."


Scia sat with an aghast look.


"You ruined your chance. Your choice is probably going to bug you for the rest of your life."
