I watched Rebecca's beautiful green eyes as they first filled with fear then confusion, and finally anger. My face remained blank. This process was as routine as breathing for me. The poison coursing through her veins took time but time was something that I had. I knew exactly how long it took to work. First, there was pain, then violent coughing, followed by vomiting and finally death.

I brought death to others. I murdered thos I called my soul mate so that I could survive. Life or love, I made my choic many centuries ago. I did not search out love but if I came upon it, I knew what I had to do. I had an entire medicine cabinet full of the poison that allowed me to get rid of these soulmates without a trace. The world needed me, needed the knowledge that only I had. I was technically 324 years old but I still looked not a day over 20.

Originally, there had been an entire group of us who sacrificed love for eternal life. We refused to die chose to eliminate any who might pose a emotional threat. We had to remain steadfast and vigilant. We had to survive. 

&#x200B;

The problem was that we as humans shared one common flaw; the need to care for something, the need of a greater purpose, the need for love. Our group slowly dwindled as members gave in to their emotions and fell in love. They passed their knowledge on to remaining members and departed to their new lives. When I did run into them, they seemed happy about their decision, but no one was ever truly happy when their death was an inevitability; ask all my previous soulmates. The last emotions on their face as they slowly died to the poision was never happiness. Eventually, I was the sole remaining heir of the sacred knowledge. I had to survive for all of humanity.

"*Why*", she choked out through gritted teeth. The pain was wracking her body with convulsions.

"*I have never loved anyone and I never will",* I said to her as tears streamed down her face.

Her eyes narrowed and her lips parted. I expected her to start coughing but instead she muttered two words.

"E*xcept yourself*", she spat out along with a fine spray of saliva mixed with blood.

With this she began laughing hystericaly. her laughs quickly devolved into a violent coughing fit. The vomiting and death would soon follow but my mind was no longer focused on her.

I left her there convulsing and coughing and walked out of the room.

I went into the bathroom and splashed some water on my face. I had killed so many people before. Some plead, cursed, threatened, bargained, seduced; but this was a new one. What she said had shook me to my core. As I looked in the mirror, I noticed the signs of aging all over my face. How had I been so blind. It was my worst nightmare; I had found my soulmate after all and unlike all the others, this one I could never get rid of. The only person I had ever truly loved was my self.

&#x200B;

I hastily made my way to my study and began transcribing all the knowledge I had. I had to get it all down before I too fell victim to the aging process. I had to.

**The officers finally managed to break down the door to the office. Besides the decomposed corpse in the bedroom, this was the only room they hadn't investigated. Behind the desk was a youg guy who didn't look a day over 20 surrounded by huge stacks of notebooks. Apparently, he had suffered a heart attack while writing some grand anthology.** 

**While it appeared that he was very young, the autopsy discovered that his body had undergone all the symptoms of advance aging. They never did discover how someone so young had managed to die of old age.**
