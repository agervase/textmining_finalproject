Emily Chung was  about to kiss the frog and reveal his handsome princey self but she stopped short when her pragmatic, practical self wrestled back control of her mind, breaking her brief spell of romanticism.

Questions and doubts quickly flashed through her mind of the consequences of bringing this supposed Prince (who apparently lived during the Crusades) into modern day USA. How long would it take for him to adjust to life in the 21st century ? Did he have any skills that could lend him some sort of job (god forbid he be a goddamn leech - that was the reason she dumped her last boyfriend)? How was he to get any form of ID to allow him to function properly in society, to get access to Medicare etc?

Not to mention since his royal family or lineage had long died out, and he would not offer her any practical benefits such as wealth or political power. Not that Emily needed any of that, she held a high paying solicitor position in a law firm and her boss had hinted at a promotion in the near future ; and being a rather private person, a life in the public eye as some consort was not very appealing.

Just then, her stomach began to growl. She realised that in all the excitement of finding this talking frog that said that he would be restored as human prince if a fine lass kissed him, she had forgotten to eat breakfast AND lunch. 

It was at that moment that a very primal thought crept into her mind. 

“Wait a minute ... I have to go .. powder myself,” she blurted out at the anthropomorphic amphibian, before dashing into her bathroom and locking the door.

She took out her cell phone from her pocket and dialed a number.

“Po po, it’s Emily. Can you send me your recipe for frog porridge?”

(I just realised that the prompt said “pet frog” but I’m too lazy to edit it)
