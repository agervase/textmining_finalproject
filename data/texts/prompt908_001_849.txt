"Chriiiist, this thing again?" I said, as my therapist wheeled in another damned droid. 

"Doc, can't I just put in my time and go? These things feel like freaking ankle bracelets or something."

"This isn't a punishment," my therapist said. "I want you to give this a real *chance*."

I groaned inwardly. These therapy droids looked straight out of a sci fi flick--all buttons and lights on a sleek shiny surface. I'd seen ten of them already. All with the same result: A disappointed look from my therapist, and an extended timeline from my court order. 

*Would you like to talk?* the blasted thing whirred. *I'm here to help you heal!*

I crept down on my haunches, right next to the thing's sensor. "I'd rather launch you into the sun," I said.

My therapist heaved a sigh. When my time was up, I asked her why she was doing this to me. "Because you're worthwhile," she said. "and it's time you accept it." She tilted her head and smiled. 

See, that's the thing I found so frustrating with her. She was *always* smiling. But did she ever pause to think that, sometimes we're not? Humans, I mean. Sometimes we're steaming bags of shit, and there's no other way to slice it. 

The worst thing about the droid was the walk up my stairs. The engineers had defeated the complex enigma of instilling human emotions in a tangle of wire, sure, but constructing a robot that could tackle Minneapolis apartments? No way. Too tall an order. The thing just bumped into the bottom step repeatedly with its tire tread, eliciting this electronic sort of purr. They were easier to carry down afterwards, though. At least with me. Broken into a hundred pieces, they were really quite manageable. "Come on, you," I sighed, hoisting the thing up like a suitcase. "Reckon my therapist will write the judge if I don't at least try."

Raul spotted me on my way up. His belly peaked from underneath his white shirt. I focused on it instead of his frown. "Late on rent again, Jackie-boy," he said. "You're out in a week."

"I'll have it to you tomorrow," I said. He and I both knew it was a lie. 

In a world full of strangers, I felt he was the only one who saw me for who I was. Because, really, the legends all held true. Minnesotans were *nice*. I would pass folks on the street, eyes bloodshot and hungover, losing count of how many strangers cheerily bade me a good morning. *To hell with you*, I'd think, *and your perfect life too*.

Once, a woman in a fleece jacket bought my morning coffee. She was staring at me through the window, waiting for my reaction as I walked up to the cashier. 

My look had been so searing it could char a steak. "You don't even know me!" I'd yelled through the window. With everyone staring, I threw the damned thing in the trash.

But Raul, he *knew*. He saw me stumble up and down the stairs, already wasted come noon. He heard the phone calls with my ex-wife, and he'd always come beating on the door. Oh he knew all right. I was a skid mark personified. A human piece of filth, that not even court-ordered therapists could crack. 

Raul eyed the droid warily as I walked down the hall to my door. "Don't set off the alarms again, eh!" Raul yelled. "Those things smoke when they break."

Inside my apartment, I fished through all the empties, hoping to strike gold. *Salvation,* I thought, clasping a can half-full *Ohhh sweet, sweet nectar.* I took a hearty gulp. The beer was warm and flat. But ever. so. needed. If I could scrape together a few dollars, I'd run down to the gas station and buy a few more. Had I checked the couch last time?

*Shall we commence?* the droid asked. 

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Truth be told, I'd forgotten it was there. Its tires hardly made a sound atop the stained carpet. 

"Believe me. You don't want to--" But when I turned, I discovered the droid had been fishing through my closet. A slender sort of arm crept out from its chassis, rifling through a shoebox full of my daughter's drawings. Right there in my fucking living room. 

The beer can skittered on the kitchen floor as I ran over. "No!" I screamed. "You don't go anywhere fucking near those!"

I pushed the droid away. It rolled along the carpet, coming to stop against a pile of dirty laundry. 

*She drew beautifully, you know*

My chest felt balled up. All the pent up *bullshit* that life had slung at me coiled inside, knotted as a rope.  I crumbled to the carpet, just staring at this thing--this little piece of paper drawn on with crayon--that had torn my life to shreds.

"You don't fucking know a *thing*," I hissed.

I felt a steel hand on my back.

*I do* it said. *Dr. Mayhew briefed me beforehand.*

"She..."

*She filled me in so there would be no further malfunctions* it said. 

It paused for a minute, letting me soak everything in. Then it said: *Would you like to talk?*

My dead daughter's picture trembled in my hands--me and her, riding our four wheeler. The smile looked so foreign drawn onto my tiny face.

*Christ,* I thought. *She'd even drawn the beer in my hand.* 

I felt emotion release. The bells and whistles--all those gleaming lights of the personal therapy droid--they blurred behind my eyes into one great muddled mess. *I* was one great muddled mess, really. I always had been. Even my daughter had seen it. I only wish I'd done something to clean it all up. 

As if it sensed all the pain, the droid took my head into its metal arms. 

"You really won't self-destruct?" I croaked.

*No,* it said. *And no longer will you*
