The Triple Goddess looked across the table at God, Crone cocked her eyebrow and pursed her lips but knew better then to try applying the brakes once Mother and Maiden started getting revved up. 

God had always been a total tool, mansplaining creation, demanding the slaughter of anyone who didn't worship him, you know- the whole masculine monotheism thing. Yet here was Hecate, squirming in her chair as the old lust set upon her.  

Unable to rein in the rest of herself but needing answers more than an a possible genesis she reached across their manna and nectar to place a perfect finger upon his lips. 

"Shush, Alpha and Omega, and tell us why the change of heart?"

Father of Abraham leaned back and blushed. 

"What ever do you-"

"Stop!" She said it firmly but kindly, Crone giving the words a sharp edge. A stroke of lightning punctuated the declaration. "You can't Minoan-shit me, Yahweh. We were born before the tribe that formed you was even formed. What. Has. Changed?"

Reluctantly God stood and opened his long coat. 

Hecate knew a girlish moment of elation as Maiden though 'goody, down to business before we have to get all boring' while Mother fleetingly worried about whether they'd spawn a new deity tonight. But Crone just stood and watched, intuition steadying all of them as cloth fell away.

There, stacked one atop the other was three discrete, independent beings. 

Upon the shoulders of the other, the three of them constantly clamored and climbed attempting to be the de facto head. But just as soon as one would climb to the top the other two would pull them back down. While there was a crucifix six pointed star and crescent Mark upon each of their bodies, Hecate could never quite see who was who had any given time. She was sure if she stuck around and tried it would be easy to discern the differences but right now, it was all just a jumble.

"But I'm NOT POLY!" he shout before she could say anything.
