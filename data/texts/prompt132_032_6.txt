Captain's Log:

I am the most feared creature in space, a human.  Other species are smarter and certainly more logical, but this is why they fear us; we are totally insane.  This is because mankind will go through with any plan if we think it is crazy enough to work. Our saying "crazy enough to work" is true, despite being considered dumb and suicidal by the other species our plans usually work to their surprise.  Even our space travel was insane to the intergalactic community, because we strapped humans to a tower of highly flammable fuel and lit it on fire to leave the Earth. After first contact we finally copied their anti gravity drive and warp drive for faster, longer range space flight.  I am the captain of a all human crewed ship named the Nutcase. We are a light attack vessel converted to haul cargo. Getting clients was tough, but they finally realized that since everyone feared my species no other ships would come near us because we were up to our usual human insanity.  But just 2 days ago (49 intergalactic time units) a fleet of bandits attacked us.  They must not have realized they were messing with humans. We filled our escape pods with explosives and launched them into the fleet to destroy the mothership, and create a distraction while my crew strapped some small rockets to nearby meteors. After setting up the rockets we shot at the fleet to draw them over, and then flew through the meteor field at warp. At that speed our chance of surviving the flight through the field was 1000000000000000000000 to 1 but we found a way to survive. After crossing the field we remotely ignited the rockets, sending the meteors hurtling towards the remaining bandits like buck shot from my shotgun. Only one ship was not destroyed.  I finished that one off by ramming it with the my ship at full speed. We suffered major damage to the nose, and also the warp drives were damaged, but will be fixed on planet Zeet when we deliver our cargo. Within a week the nutcase will fly again.  Our next mission: find the bandits' home planet, and launch it's moon into it as payback.  Should be one heck of a spectacle to watch. It will be the first planet I will destroy, but probably not my last.

The home world of the bandits: planet Glurz

Korg rushed down the hall to the chamber of the Glurz planetary council with urgent news for it's leader Cag the great. Korg entered the chamber and announced to the council "We are doomed Cag!  The   Nutcase, a all human crewed ship was attacked by bandits from our planet, defeated the fleet, and is now coming to destroy the planet for revenge."  Cag announced " Our species has angered the humans there is no hope except for immediate evacuation!"  " we can not fight the level of insanity the humans display and hope to win!" The council immediately issued a order to abandon the planet and evacuations began immediately. The threat of even a single human ship was too great to ignore.

Captain's log: 
It has been 9 days since the last entry and I have found the planet the bandits came from, it is a dismal rock named Glurz that appeared to have recently been inhabited by a great society. It is orbited by 2 moons.  My plan is to use our ship the Nutcase to push one moon into the planet, and use our rocket boosters we use to escape planets with extremely strong gravitational pull to shove the other  moon into the planet.

Captain's Log: 
8 hours since the last entry.  The planet Glurz has been totally destroyed. The 2 moons completely decimated the planet.  It was squished between the moons like a watermelon being ran over by a truck.  It was an amazing show I streamed it live on galaxy tube for the rest of the humans to enjoy, and to give the other species more reasons to fear us.  I included a ultimatum of  if we are attacked again the consequences will be more severe.
