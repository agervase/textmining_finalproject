There's only one bit at the end that satisfies the prompt. but here it goes:

Fragments of war part I.

&#x200B;

In her dreams, she sees.

She sees a large grassy meadow that extends off into the horizon

She doesn’t know if these dreams are memories from before she was adopted, or of a time before she was blind. Sometimes, people come to visit her in her dreams. There is an old man with a stern face who frightens her, yet whose voice is soft and kind and bring her bread that smells of lavender and tastes of honey. Sometimes an older lady comes and combs out her tangled hair while rambling out complaints about her husband. Occasionally, a warrior clad in shiny armor stops by to lie down and gaze into the sky.

But the one who appears most in her dreams is the girl. She thinks they are the same age, yet the girl is slightly taller and with eyes colored like the sky. Like the warrior, she is clad in heavy metal plates that looked as if they would weigh her slight frame down. Yet she dances through the grass, as nimble as a hare. She likes these dreams most of all – dreams when the girl with eyes like the sky comes to visit and play with her.

Today is a little different. The sky eyed girl wishes to show her something. The girl drags her out to a hill in the middle of meadow, putting her fingers to her lips to tell her to keep quiet. Then, she puts her fingers together and lets out a long and clear whistle. From the edge of the meadow, horse runs up to the two of them.  The girl reaches out and the horse nuzzles her and licks her hand. The girl begins to brag, her voice laced with pride and excitement. She smiles. It has been a while since she has heard her friend so happy.

Her eyes begin to burn.

It is a nagging itch at first, which turns into searing pain. The once vibrant world fades into grey and crashes and shatters to pieces. She first hears loud neighing which turns into whimpers of pain. The girl’s voice too changes. As the last whimpers begin to fade out, her friend’s voice turns to anger and rage. She doesn’t know what she has done, but the rage in her friend’s voice continues to increase.

And then, the girl with the eyes colored like the sky speaks the words she should not.

Suddenly, everything changes. Her eyes had stopped hurting, but now her body itself has begun to contort in pain – molding and changing. The pain engulfs her. She knows she has to make it stop somehow. As she flees she hears her friend’s voice call out to her. It is tinted with confusion and regret. As she awakens on the bed of the hospital, the voice of her friend fades out to silence….

She nods her head as she tries to follow along the words are spoken to her. She doesn’t understand everything the doctor is saying to her, but she understands enough to know that she might be able to see again. The rest is as confusing as some of the other words she has heard the nurses say  in hushed tones as she laid in bed and pretended to sleep – words like ‘perfect compatibility’, ‘neuroregeneration’ and ‘organ donor’. As the doctor finishes and she hears the door close behind him, his voice is replaced by two familiar voices speaking to her. They are the voice of her adopted mother and father. Their voices are calm and soothing; reassuring her it would all be alright. As they grasp onto her hands, she feels the pain from last night’s dream slowly fade away…

That night she dreams again. This time, it’s not of the meadow. It is cold and damp here. She squirms in the dark, trying to fight off the gnawing hunger in her stomach. It has been too long since she last fed, but she cannot risk being discovered.

Suddenly, light fills her eyes. She hears shouting. The voice seems resolute, but she can hear the trembling of fear underneath it. She turns her eyes towards the source. Her eyes can barely make out the figure holding a sword and a shield. From the voice, it must be a young man. She smells blood in the air.

The gnawing hunger turns into a screaming ravenous impulse to feast. She leaps into the air lunging towards the figure.

In that moment, she sees it. A twisted demonic face with piercing eyes colored like the grass. It’s the last thing she sees before she feels her limbs freeze in place. A searing pain runs through her eyes and across her face as the man shouts out in a warcry and the word turns to black. As she falls to her knees, she feels a sharp pain pierce through her chest…

It’s dark now. She cannot see anything nor feel her limbs. She struggles to move but cannot.

She opens her eyes to find herself once more on the bed of the hospital.

&#x200B;

Her parents are excited and anxious now. She can tell it from their voices. They chatter about all the places they will visit when she has her sight back. She knows that they have dreamed for this for a long time – to travel the world with their adopted daughter who can once again see. She too hopes this dream will come true. Perhaps somewhere out there is a place just like the happy meadows of her dreams. Their voices fade out as the door opens. She holds out her arm and feels the sharp cold metal of the needle pierce into it. Sleep takes her away again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s still dark. She knows time has passed, but can’t tell how long.

Suddenly for the first time in a long while, she feels warmth. A voice speaks to her. It’s tearful and regretful, and the words are filled with apologies. Though she cannot place where she heard it, it feels strangely peaceful and nostalgic.

The voice is fading out. As she strains her ears, she makes out one last sentence.

“If we ever meet again, this time for sure….”

She opens her eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As she looks around in the white hospital room, she sees many faces that she does not recognize. The old man in a strange coat who looks at her anxiously, and a middle aged couple. As they begin to speak, she instantly recognizes them as the doctor and her parents. She smiles.

But there is another face as well. In the corner of the room, behind them all is a young lady clad in armor with sky colored eyes.

She finds a name come to her lips

“Ath…”

With a smile her friend brings her fingers to her lips just like she did in that meadow long ago. The next instant, the figure vanishes from her sight.
