The chair swung halfway round, 2 tiny hands appeared and a squeaking noise was heard as Cody shuffled the rest of the way round to face his crew. 

Cody took a deep breath, and slowly clutching his claws together started narrating. 'Why do I want to destroy the asteroid belt? Great question, to answer it we have to go back 65 million years ago. A flourishing dinosaur civilisation. Everything was just great. Food aplenty, top predator, the works'.

The crew glanced around at each other with slightly bemused expressions as he continued: 'Then the blasted buggers in the asteroid belt had enough of our advanced civilisation' and tried to wipe us out'.

'But sir', one of the humans interrupted, 'Asteroids are inanimate objects, governed only by the laws of physics?' 

'Wrong.' Cody exclaimed. 'It's a conspiracy, that's what's they want you to believe, those idiots tried to kill of the last of the dinosaurs, well they failed.'

The crew were starting to think the all expenses paid trip to the asteroid belt observing the wonders of the universe, wasn't exactly what it was cut out to be.

Cody persisted with his story: 'The Blomfonstein family survived in hiding, licking their wounds, waiting to hit back at the _asteroid belt_. And now, humanity's technology has finally caught up to allow me to execute my family's goal. Eradicating the asteroid once in for all. First mate Bob,' 

'That's __still__ not my name' Tim interjected.

'Doesn't matter, you're Bob, he's Bob, she's Bob, you're all Bob. Annnway Bob, man the gravitational misalignment tool aim for the asteroid belt.' Cody finished his spiel, as the quark gluon powered laser turned around towards the asteroid field.

'Should we tell him that you can't actually like destroy the field?' Tim whispered to the crew.

'Nah, he'll figure it out eventually.'

Cody turned his hair around to face open space, and with a devilish twinkle in his eye, whispered to himself 'Goodbye Asteroids'.
