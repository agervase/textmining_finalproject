Brown, shaggy hair, narrow face, green eyes, tall, slouched-posture, brown sports jacket with a blue and white checkered shirt underneath, jeans, and vans. They were looking around in a nearly 360 degree motion in what looked like a paranoid frenzy. What brought my soulmate’s eyes to this person was intrigue, but ended the sight-seeing with a feeling of admiration inside. She couldn’t quite explain it, or so it felt, and it took longer than I care to admit that I realized that person she was looking at was me. 

When I returned to my body, I looked across the street, hoping that she would still be there. She was, but as I was beginning to look towards her, she was looking away, about to continue walking. I decided to run across the street, weaving through cars and other angry New Yorkers, until I reached her side. I felt a short-lived amount of satisfaction making it over there, but I had to follow through and get to her. She was walking in the direction of that weirdly named coffee shop, Café Grumpy I think. 

I was about to reach her, tap on her shoulder and tell her I saw her see me, hoping it doesn’t come across as a drunken pick-up line. Before that moment happened however, she was stopped by a tall, muscular man, who hugged her. They gave off a few quick words, laughed, and gave each other what was just longer than a peck, but felt like forever.

I stood there, flabbergasted. This wasn’t how this was supposed to happen, but I needed to do something, and quick. After a moment, they continued walking, and so did I, walking faster to try and catch them. 

It’s funny, at that same moment “First Day of My Life” by the Bright Eyes started playing in my head.
