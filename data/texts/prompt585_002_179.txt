As he hit the key to send the message back to mission control back on Earth, he wondered what would be the death of him: himself, or the inhabitants of the Red Planet... He pulled on the slide of the handgun he had smuggled in his personal cargo, seeing that glimmer from the brass casing in the chamber. He had at least one round left, he could end it now if he wanted. He didn't. He wanted to take as many of whatever those things were with him. They brutally ripped through all his friends he had made on the journey to Mars. He looked back into the blood soaked hallway he had traversed to get here. It appeared clear, but who knew for sure. Eating a bullet crept back into his mind one last time, it would definitely beat getting shredded to pieces and eaten alive, but he only had to run roughly 30 yards down the corridor and hook right to reach the reactor. That one round, if placed properly, could blow this whole place sky high. Taking a deep breath he rushed for the reactor room. He could swear he could feel them right on him, whether it was in his mind or in reality he didn't know, but he kept running anyways. As he turned the corner, almost slipping on blood and discarded pieces of his former friends and acquaintances he was in the reactor room... Right in front of one of them. The size was unlike anything he had seen in person on Earth. It towered above him, with its saliva dripping out of its open mouth onto the floor in front of him mixing with the entrails of the corpse between them. Without any time to react accordingly the monster rushed him and speared him with its tail raising him up to the ceiling of the room he shot the reactor as it did, watching as the sirens sounded as it slowly started to meltdown. He smiled and put the gun to his head. Click. "FUCK!"
