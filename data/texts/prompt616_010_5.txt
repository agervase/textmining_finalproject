How was I supposed to know that a shrimp allergy was Crocodilo’s one weakness? I was just a waiter. My boss told me to stay in my section, but when I saw Crocodilo in the club, you bet your ass I went over to offer him some cocktail shrimp and coconut radish dipping sauce! At first, I thought he was just so in love with the flavor that he was pretending it took his breath away. It’s hard to tell with a face like that, you know? A crocodile maw wide open, gasping for breath, looks a lot like a big gaping maw full of way too many teeth that want to eat you. It’s hard to remember your CPR training and try to apply that to super physiology in the moment.

&#x200B;

Crocodilo was the first super-villain I accidentally killed. It’s such a stupid name, but it wasn’t unfitting. I heard he used to be some top-shelf government geneticist, but something went wrong on a top-secret project, and he got somehow transformed into an anthropomorphic crocodile with skin impervious to any weapon, venomous saliva that could kill in under a minute, and the strength and speed of an actual crocodile. How strange that he died because the geneticist he used to be had a shrimp allergy.

&#x200B;

Don’t get me started on Leeroy Jenkins. It seems stupid names are fairly common among low-level super-villains. He called himself that because his ability was to inspire great chaos and lure people to their deaths, like lemmings off a cliff (which is not a thing that actually happens, in case you didn’t know, those lemmings were chased off that cliff by the documentary crew, it’s horrible). Unfortunately, he was also very easily distracted, and I swear I was just turning around to pick up that banana peel. I had no idea it could actually do what you see in cartoons, and send someone flying directly into the path of an oncoming Waste Management truck.

&#x200B;

And then the third, the one that got me into my current predicament. Nostrilus the Great Flayer of Scents. I think that one wins. Just saying.

&#x200B;

Now, Nostril had lived in my apartment building for about three years. He was a tall, kind of gangly guy, with a huge nose and an odd tilt to his neck, like he was always trying to look up my skirt. I knew he wasn’t, because his eyes were at the appropriate level, but I wondered once if he just really needed a more ergonomic pillow. We’d met, in the hallway a few times, but I just thought he was maybe just a rather flamboyant cultist or something. I don’t judge, you know? Until he finally introduced himself, sometime in the second year, and followed his name with a few aliases and titles, in case I hadn’t heard of him. I had. In person, he smelled a lot more normal than I expected, but I guess he’d want to keep it light around his home. The Destroyer of Sinuses and the Scintillator of Smells (missed opportunity, right?) must, after all, have a sensitive side.

&#x200B;

As it turns out, he was an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor in a small clinic downtown. How that led him to super-villainy I never learned. Right at that moment, I dropped my grocery bags trying to get my keys out to get into my apartment and away from this crazy man, and I guess the jar of salsa fell on top on the one ghost pepper I managed to find in three different markets, and crushed it. The air instantly filled with the sharp, clinging, burning aroma of capsaicin, and my eyes began to water. Behind me, I heard a sharp gasp and a crumpling noise. Turns out that big nose of his was his superpower, and he wasn't wearing his special plugs because he was trying to ask me out. That ghost pepper must have hit his sinuses like a ghostly skeleton on a chopper powered by all the fires of Hell, and good ol’ Nostrilus couldn’t handle the heat so he left the kitchen. Metaphysically, as it were. If anything flashed before his eyes as he died, I hope it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to now. Right now. Sitting at this table, at some FBI Headquarters building in Who-Knows-Where, Texas, with one Special Agent  Willis Bloom across the table from me, in the middle of not-so-subtly trying to determine what super power I possessed that allowed me to so efficiently take out three super-villains in the span of 24 hours. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, this all happened today. I am protesting outright now, trying to get him to believe that I’m perfectly normal, and not at all a superhero, when the wall to our right caves in, and a man in a cape steps through.

&#x200B;

“Robber Raper? You have one chance. Tell me what you’re up to, and I’ll make your death quick, as you did for your competitors.”

&#x200B;

So the first thing you’ll notice there is my name. That may be another reason why the FBI guy was giving me a hard time. Speaking, as we were, on the topic of stupid names, not only did my mother try to give me a boy’s name, she couldn’t spell it. And my last name, Rapier, is French or something, and everyone somehow mishears it no matter how clearly I say it. I’m not sure what he means about my death, but I think some part of me is wondering what *his* weakness might be, so I try not to think about death at all.

&#x200B;

“*Rapier*. It’s Rap*i*er. Yeah. That’s me. Um. You must be…?”

&#x200B;

“Yes, I am the Caped Crus4der (4 copyright reasons).  Now tell me, are you acting alone?”

&#x200B;

Have you ever heard a number being used as a letter in an actual sentence before? It sounds really strange and unnatural, maybe even magical, and for a moment I’m convinced that must be his superpower. When I don’t answer, because I’m lost in thought, as usual, which is why I’d be a terrible supervillain, his expression seems to harden, and I start to feel my body lifting into the air, an invisible fist crushing my chest. This guy is wound up pretty tight for a superhero. He should be out upholding justice, not holding me up in here not letting me breathe. I'd be outraged, if I could breathe enough to muster any breath to say anything.

&#x200B;

I’m gasping for air, and Caped Crus4der is still being a right bastard and denying me it, when my mother calls. My phone, sitting face-up on the interrogation room table, lights up, her familiar tone ringing out. Tom Waits' gravelly baritone asks, "Hello, hello there, is this Martha?" My mother's given name is the only thing that shows when she calls, followed by “Mom” in parentheses. This is so I never forget, even when I really want to. Suddenly the grip loosens, and I’m set back on my feet. Caped guy looks at my phone, then back at me, and speaks, softly and defeatedly.

&#x200B;

“Your mother’s name is Martha? Why did it have to be Martha...”

&#x200B;

And then he dies. This is going to be hard to explain to my mother.
