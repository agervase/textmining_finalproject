The convenience store owner was talking. I strained to read his lips in the dim light. "Take your stupid gang signs and get out of my shop!" I scrambled back towards the portal as he pulled a shotgun out from under the counter. Thankfully, he didn't fire it. 

This was what I deserved, apparently. A portal opened up in my living room and I just *had* to walk through it. Stumbled right into a gang war, judging from the price of soda, the tight pants, and the 'fro picks, somewhere in the 70's. Thankfully, whatever unseen force had summoned it was holding the door, at least for now. It was time to go back home. I crouched through the scintillating doorway, which had positioned itself in the middle of an alley between two dumpsters, and fell into a big field. 

A farmer shouted something and approached. I held up my hands in surrender as he approached me with a pitchfork. 

"I mean you no harm," I signed, on the off chance he'd understand. The pitchfork came clattering to the ground as he backed away.

"Stay away from me! Stay away! Norma! Get the children indoors!" He rushed off towards a small white cottage. I wasn't desperate enough to follow him. 

The portal was nowhere to be seen. Great. I set down the uneven path that bordered the grain field and came to a crossroads. Thankfully, I was in a period where signposts had been invented. Unfortunately, this one had all but worn away, and the spelling seemed odd in the letters that remained. A passing rider steadied his horse.

A leather-gloved hand clapped me on the shoulder, bringing me face to face with the rider. "Ignoring me, are you?" I read off his lips. He did not look happy. 

I pointed to my ears and shook my head. He raised an eyebrow. "I'm just trying to get back home," I signed. He glared, grabbed my arm, and leaned close to my (useless) ear. I think he probably whispered something. Then he pointed to one of the signs and rode off. 

First person I met in these portal adventures that didn't try to kill me. Figured taking his advice was better than randomly guessing. The sun was setting and I needed shelter. 

I drew stares from passerby, likely due to being in jeans and a t-shirt, but none approached or showed any hostility as I traveled down the path. If I turned to meet their gaze, they'd develop a sudden interest in their boots and hurry along. After an hour of walking, I arrived at a stone tower and knocked on the door. It opened on its own. 

The air smelled of spice and ashes, and strange glass statuettes peered at me from a shelf on the left. A white cat shot up the stairs, claws clicking against the stonework. I followed it. The second floor was no less amazing, with displays of medieval taxidermy lining the walls. The portal from before hung, shimmering, over the fireplace and a man in dark robes sat in a circle of black chalk decorated with symbols I did not understand. 

"Welcome," he signed.
