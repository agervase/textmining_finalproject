***An Interview with a Serial Killer:***  


Why do I think our world works the way it does?  No clue.  I've given up trying to piece it all out.  I like to go with the classic stories as laid out in the holy texts.  Should I go into it for the recording's sake?   Oh, fine.   So...Legend has it, thousands of years ago when the world was a wilder place and the gods were known commonly to man that one woman, Megara, daughter to the King of Thebes would change mankind forever by simply dying.   I'm sure you know the legend.  The one where Hera tricks Hercules into killing his wife and sons?  Well, if the scholars are to be believed, upon the realization of his tragedy the stricken Hercules beseeched his father to find the reincarnated soul of his lost love again.  Thus it was made true by the powers of the father of the gods, in collaboration with Athena and Aphrodite convinced the fates themselves to rethread and weave yarns from threads.  This is why our symbols for the fates start as embroidered silks, but end in heavy brocades.   


Again, if the scholars are to be believed.  But then why else would mankind be the only race upon Terra to so stop aging upon maturity?  Further, explain to me in purely scientific ways they might be driven to seek out their reincarnated soulmate so that they might age together, hmm?  Riddle me that.  But, as is true of most things divine and godly, there are loopholes.  That's where my story comes into play. Thus as it is, every oh...sixteen to twenty years I can feel her tugging at me.  My soulmate, having reached her new bodies maturity comes seeking for me, even as she does now.  Thus it has been and why my long thread has evaded the Fates' yarns for so long, instead merely tangling, twirled and touched along my matched thread without ever actually weaving to a whole.    


How long now?  I've managed this way for...a few hundred years.  I could probably figure out the exact date if I wanted but umm...lets see.  What year did the steam engine get invented?  Sometime in the early 1700's I think.   Yes, well, I remember the papers the day the first one debuted. I remember it, because it was the first time I killed her.   The first time I stabbed myself in the heart by plunging a knife through hers.  Her name was Sylvia.  As far as I'm concerned her name will always be Sylvia.  I loved....no, I still love her.    


Don't look at me like that...with those...judging eyes.  Ugh, so much like hers your eyes but so...different.  The saying that eyes are windows to the soul are true by the way.   Each of the sixteen times I've met her and thus ended her, I've always had to watch the life drain from the exact same set of wonderfully blue eyes.   Always the perfectly. Exact.  Same.  Shade.  Every time.  It's how I've always known her and how I will know her soon when next I have to destroy the other half of my soul.    


Oh, yes, right...your question, I'm sorry miss.  I forgot, how could I kill the one I love.  Fear.  As crazy as it sounds, I am a coward.  As much as love will compel you to the insane, fear of death can compel so much harder.  At least...for me it can.  That shade of blue sets my heart thrilling with love, desire and passion while that same beat carries dread, fear and adrenaline spurred by a survival instinct shouting to run from my looming death.   Conceptually, I know it's ridiculous. My soulmate only heralds my coming end in eventuality but that's apparently enough for my fickle heart to be spurred to terror's run.  I've had at least three hundred years!  You'd think that would be enough!  But it's not for me!   


What's that?  What do I do with all my stolen time?  Stolen...I suppose that's a word for it. Well, ma'am.  I study.  Technology is so fascinating.  Imagine, for a moment, constantly being the correct age to hide in colleges across the world.  Universities where you can be right there as the newest technologies are developed and come out!  I've had enough time and classes in my life that I stopped counting after my 30th degree.  I've studied in dozens of universities around the world and being in my early prime, why...I cannot imagine a better age to have stopped aging!  My life has been ever constantly exciting with new...things!  


You're judging me again.  I can see it in your face.  You don't approve that I've given up on real love for things.  It's all written across your stare.  Love is an intangible.  Incalculable.  Priceless.  But it does not better humanity.  I may fear death but that's because I saw too much of it in my early life.   I saw what love accomplishes, for my parents could not have loved each other of my many, many siblings more but eventually?  Poverty and famine took all of them.  So I hid.  I hid until I found a purpose.  A purpose that required me to sacrifice such frivolities and luxuries such as love! And who better to make such sacrifices than one who'd already spent years making such things for selfish reasons?    


No, love has never bettered all of mankind, merely two of mankind.  I've dedicated my life and that of over a dozen of Sylvias toward the betterment of mankind.  I have had a hand in nearly every major technological advancement since the invention of the microchip.  Love does not improve humanity, merely a couple of humans at a time.  I've *sacraficed* in ways that nobdy, *nobody* alive can understand to make the world better for *THEM*!  Do NOT judge me, miss.  You...cannot understand.    


I...huh? I'm sorry, what are you doing.  Are...are those....contacts?  Oh....oh my.  S...s....Sylvia?  Is...is that you?  Please...now that you understand, tell me that you forgive me.  Tell me that you understa...no!  NO! PLEASE! N...

***Diary of a Serial Killer:  Year one.***  


Dear Diary,

One does not piss off the fates.  At least, not for long.  Where there's a thread, there's a pair of scissors and through my life her sister Atropos has been whispering to me to find a pair.  Clotho may now reweave my soulmate into the weave and thus maybe I'll join him down the line.  Revenge, as they say, is in fact a dish best served cold.  And I believe I will relish it's flavor in another eighteen years or so.
