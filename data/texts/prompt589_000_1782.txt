The gods of the multiverse mingled freely in a particularly empty, cavernous stretch of space. 

Eru, one of the younger and somewhat naive gods, began poking and prodding at one of the few planets that drifted nearby. Perhaps he'd start his first civilisation. He'd been thinking deeply about this revolutionary system of evolution and governance...

"Leave it alone," a massive god with three heads said behind him, his voice booming through the universe. "We're here to nominate candidates for the new God of Earth, not fiddle with that little planet. Anyway, I can read your thoughts, Eru - you simply *can't* do what you're planning. It's impractical. It'll never work."

The smaller god left it sulkily. "Fine. Where's Josh, then? Shouldn't he report on Earth's progress under his watch?"

The three-headed god rolled its many eyes and turned to address all the gods gathered around him. "He refused. Not that he *could*. Spent too much time drifting through the multiverse. And you know how much he likes to ride the wormholes, right? I honestly think it scrambled his brains. Probably forgot all about Earth a millennium ago."

A wispy god made up of mostly stardust sighed, coughing up a new solar system. "Well, there aren't many to nominate. We're all busy with our own galaxies and planets. We might as well choose Eru here. Why not give him his shot? We all have to start somewhere, right? And anyway, it can't get much worse on Earth right now...if he has to mess something up..."

The gods glanced at one another as Eru trembled in excitement. The three-headed god glared at him.

"Okay, Eru. But you'd better not try anything unorthodox," he growled. "Definitely not what I heard you thinking - trust me, the planet will explode into chaos. It's good to be benevolent, but don't overdo it. Just pay a bit more attention than Josh did, alright? A happy middle between what their old gods did, and Josh. Do you hear me? We'll be checking on you, so don't dare try anything *weird*. I warn you, I'm good at smiting. Even other gods, if need be."

Eru nodded solemnly, but was cackling inwardly. He knew gods. Oh, they *said* they'd 'check in' and 'watch', but they had their own galaxies to worry about. When one of them finally remembered to visit, it would be time for the next election. He'd have Earth all to himself. 

And he had always hated their style. All aloof and high and mighty and 'mysterious ways'. And cynical, never trusting their species. Simply making decisions without any input. Take Earth, for example - all that doom and gloom about a supposed 'looming world war' and an imploding planet. But had anybody actually given them the chance to shape their world to their liking? They couldn't be as bad as the others said, anyway. Pure propaganda and spitefulness, he bet. Things were going to change.

**Six months later**

The world woke up to see the same image of a cheerful, smiling god drifting through their minds. The same words echoed in their thoughts, as clearly as if someone were whispering in their ears.

*Good morning, afternoon and evening, humans! This is your new God speaking. I'll swing down to Earth so you can all have a look-see soon. Get to know the new guy. But first, I want to revamp things. Spice it up! So pray hard on what you'd like the Earth to look like, and yourselves! Yes, even you, atheists - you'll soon change your minds. I'll mix and shake this dreary evolution up a little. Talk about slow! Gosh, you guys don't even have wings yet. How depressing is that, right?*

He was silent for a bit, then spoke again.

*Now, I promise to incorporate absolutely everything all of you wish for in my new designs. I'm omnipotent, after all - trust me, it can be done. I'm sure you're a lovely, cooperative species who will agree on the basics. Your changes will take effect immediately, too. Yes, I'm that good! And get this: there's no need to even worship me, unless you really want to or something. So let's get started. What do you guys think should change? Let's rule this thing together!*
