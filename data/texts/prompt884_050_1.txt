"Eenie meenie minie mo, catch a tiger by her toe!"

You couldn't hear the bones of little toe crunch between the teeth of the pliers as she screamed into the cloth bound around her mouth, digging painfully into the corners of her lips. She blinked more tears from her eyes, soddening the rag even more so. 

Minutes later another gutteral, gasping shriek. 

He laughed and took the wet cloth to her brow, shushing her and gloating.

"Oh you cow, you think any one can hear you? Don't worry, this is our private little secret and you can make as much noise as you want." 

He pulled her top open, exposing her breasts and their large swollen areola, slapping each in turn before reaching around the wriggling, resisting form to unclasp her bra and take it for himself. Once it had been released, he spat in her face and slapped her with as much sting as he could manage. Proud as a peacock he put the bra on and strutted away from her to pick up a whip, tweaking at the cups and arranging them on his otherwise naked torso. He was sweating, rivulets of sweat making the paint he had daubed on his chest bleed down the lines of his abdomen. Her bra would be stained. 

He felt the weight of the whip in his left, and then his right hand, before turning swiftly on his heels and striking the floor next to his quivering prey. She jumped, grimaced, and he purveyed her. 

"Disgusting cunt, pissed yourself now."  

He pulled her skirt over the knees he had bound to a chair, exposing her fully.

And dropped his whip. 

The body count was higher than he expected. 

He looked at her eyes screwed shut. He knelt down, and she tried to kick but the overwhelming urge to push in other ways took hold. He held the crown gently.

He looked at her eyes screwed shut, the body twisted, the body twisted, he looked at her eyes screwed shut. 

And as he held her in his arms and watched as she opened them for the first time, he knew he was in danger.
