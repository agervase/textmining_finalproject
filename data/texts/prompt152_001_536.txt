"OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD. You killed Ryan!"

I drop to my knees in horror. My best friend, dead.... by my... hands?

"It's okay. Grief is a process, you'll get over it."

"You just shot my... OUR best friend!"

"I know. I don't have much time. Listen, this little time travel experiment you guys are contemplating? Goes to complete shit. I regret everything leading to this exact moment, and I can't have it repeat again.... I'm sorry"

Future-me aims the gun at my head.... BANG. I flinch, accepting death... but, I'm still here. I open my eyes to see me, er, my future self with a gaping hole in his forehead. He falls in his own pool of blood.

"What?"

I look to see that it's my friend, Ryan; or at least, a future version of him dressed in a business suit stained with blood.

"What the fuck is going on?"

"Hey, pal."

"No, no more words unless it's an explanation of what's going on."

"You see "you" down there? He's from an alternate timeline. A timeline screwed from us messing with time. He wanted to go back and prevent World War II, but his interference caused a complete takeover of the United States..."

"Oh, like we're Nazis now?"

"Worse... Japanese."

"Oh shit."

"Yeah. Heavy stuff. If I see one more Anime mascot giving out a parking ticket... listen. I don't have much more time. I have to complete my mission."

"Your mission?"

"Yes. I may have eliminated future you... but he only exists cause you're alive... I'm sorry."

"Oh, come on!"

My friend aims for my head and cocks his pistol. BANG. I'm sure I'm dead this time... except... I'm not? My friend has been shot in the head by me. Or, not me. Another version of me?

"Hey, me."

"No, no, I'm not doing this again. I've had enough trauma for one afternoon. Let me guess, you're here to kill me because whatever we did caused ripples in another timeline and it's only possible because I'm alive in this timeline, so I have to be eliminated?"

"What? No. I mean we did some weird stuff but nothing that serious."

"Nothing serious? Then why did you have to kill Ryan?"

"There's infinite versions of us doing different things at different points in time. Honestly at this point, I'm just dicking around pretending I'm a secret agent trying to track down--"

BANG. I drop dead... the future self, that is. I can't believe I'm saying that I shot myself. I couldn't take it anymore. Now I have a pile of dead bodies that all look like me and Ryan. The horror... the smell.... if only....

&#x200B;

If only I could have prevented it. That gives me an idea.
