"Daddy," he asked, "are clouds candy?"

"Ha! No, son, no - they look a little like it, though. Clouds are made of lots of tiny drops of water, hanging in the air."

"Water in the air? Why don't they fall down?"

"They do, son - that's rain!"

"That's funny, Daddy!" he giggled. Kids find the strangest stuff hilarious.

The road hissed beneath us as the car ate another mile.

"Daddy..." he began again. Another question. I just hoped that it was something I knew. "Daddy, what are Earth's defense systems?"

The creature stared at me from the car seat, eyes like burning coals - dark and hot and burning the answer from my brain.

My brow bristled with sudden sweat. "N- No. No, I don't want to tell you." I fought for control, to keep the answer to myself. I can't, I mustn't answer.

"What is the defense system, Father?" the creature demanded.

The steering wheel faded under my hands, it's solidity dissipating like smoke.

"N- NO! NO! NOOOO!!!"

`TELL ME` it intoned.

"I... I love you, son."

`NOW.`

"I'm... I'm sorry."

The car was gone now, all pretense ended - but I still retained the memories of my son, a memory that still held very real emotions - as real as the shackles that now bound my wrists.

Choking back tears, I finally answered him. "Earth's primary defense is a Mk XVII hyper-reality simulation system, with an advanced AI trojan hostage."

`IMPOSSIBLE. WE WOULD HAVE DETECTED IT.`

"The simulator is shielded by an impenetrable Vogonic cloaking system."

The mixture of shock and fear clear on the creature's face was clearly human. It tried to get away, but suddenly found itself quite immobilized. My bonds melted away from my wrists as I stood up. I stepped over to the trapped thing. Tears flowed from my eyes as I whispered, "I ʟᴏᴠᴇ ʏᴏᴜ, Sᴏɴ."

I wept as I opened my mouth impossibly wide and devoured him whole.
