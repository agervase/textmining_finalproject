The shuttle rocked under Lyca's wavering hand. She had only ever flown once before, not counting her hours in the simulators, and she'd never flown anything with a military grade fusion engine. It had a hell of a lot more kick than she'd expected.

> Shuttle Romeo Lima Victor 827, you are not authorized for take off. Repeat, you are not authorized for take off. Change heading and land on platform 12. 

The radio had started up almost immediately after Lyca was airborne. She wanted desperately to turn it off before the inevitable threats of violence began, afraid she would lose her nerve, except she had no idea how.

Her plan was the kind of scheme only a teenager could even conceive of, let alone run the numbers on and decide to go ahead with. She would sneak out of the family dormitories while her father was posted in the airforce base for December. She'd hijack the shuttle in the cover of darkness, and take off without anyone even noticing, keeping close to the ground so as to avoid radar stations. Then, she would bee-line it for Earth and crash land in the water, near land, relying on the redundant safety features of the military shuttle to keep her alive. 

So far, the plan was not going quite as well as she'd hoped. Other than sneaking out of the dorms and getting the shuttle in the sky, just about every other thing had gone wrong. The blowback from overcharging the engines at takeoff had blown up half the hangar and woken up the entire base. It also sent Lyca flying straight up out of the base's electromagnetic eco-sphere, right into the radar of just about every military outpost on the Moon. 

But there was no fixing all that now. Lyca was pot-committed. She set a course for Earth and pushed the throttle to full.

> Lyca, Lyca can you hear me?

Lyca recognized that voice. Her father had gotten to the radio tower. She was glad that she did not know what button would let her reply. If she did, he might have been able to convince her that she was wrong, that the Moon wasn't a dead end. Instead, Lyca could only listen as he spoke.

> Lyca, honey, you need to turn around. I know how difficult it can be to grow up here. I did it, your mother did it, and we both hated it just as much as you. 

There was some noise in the background, men talking. Lyca thought she heard the word "missile". Her father said something sternly off the microphone, likely a sharp command, and then he returned to the radio.

> But sweetheart, there's a reason we've chosen to stay here. You know the histories, you've read them all, I know you have. You have to trust that they are true, Lyca. You have to believe that everything is the way it is for a reason! 

Lyca felt hot tears forming in her eyes as she considered the irrevocability of her choice. Even if she got away, even if her father convinced the military hotheads not to shoot her shuttle out of the sky, success still meant never seeing her family ever again. They would never come after her. They were true believers, the truest, high ups in the Lycanthrope government. Lyca would be a great shame, a black sheep, better forgotten than pursued. 

> Oh sweetheart, please, Lyca, turn around. You won't be in any trouble, I pr-m--e y--. Yo-- moth-- i- wa---ng j--

The radio cut out as the shuttle's roaring fusion engine tore around the edge of the Moon, into the light side of the rock. It would be now or never, Lyca knew. She was playing chicken, not only with the military but with her own father. She knew she would not flinch. Would they? 

She waited, the ship rumbling under the strain of incredible speed, for a missile to blow her into oblivion. She waited until she was clear into the light side of the Moon, until she was leaving the pockmarked sphere far behind. She only began to breath easy once she was out of Lycanthropic space altogether, in neutral territory.

The radio buzzed angry static, and Lyca choked down tears. She would never hear her father's voice again. 

She prayed, to Van Helsing himself, that it would all be worth it. 

**************

The landing did not go smoothly - which is to say it went exactly as Lyca had anticipated. The ship came down hard into a body of salt water, in the middle of a harbor of all places. The autopilot took over at the last moment, just as piezoelectric foam came to life and surrounded Lyca in 360-degree shock absorption. 

The impact was still quite distressing - but the ship's hull did not breach, nor did the interior flood with salt water - 
and Lyca was able to move all her limbs once the foam receded into the floor. 

"Any landing you can walk away from," Lyca mumbled to herself, massaging a painful strain in her neck.

After confirming the ship was buoyant and that the airlock was above water, Lyca manually popped it, activating the explosive bolts holding it in place. 

As she climbed out of the shuttle, she was struck by a blast of hot, humid air. It filled the cabin almost immediately, along with a rank, fetid odor, like rotten eggs. Sweat began pouring down the back of Lyca's shirt right away. 

It was dusk, the sun was setting in a glorious bright red starburst on the far horizon. Lyca surveyed her surroundings, looking around for the inevitable military escort, the heavily armed "welcoming party," so to speak.

Except there was none. She scanned the harbor in the dying sunlight and did not see a single ship, only the dark red water, uniformly covered in thick algae. There, in the middle of the harbor, was the famed green statue, the one the Lycanthropic counsel called the "Queen of Human Hypocrisy." There, beyond her, was the city island, New York, with its towering skyscrapers of steel and cement, unconstrained by the limitations of artificial magnetic fields and solar radiation bombardment. The spires of the buildings rose high into the sky.

Except as the sun receded and night came, not a single light could be seen in the great expanse of those towering buildings. The blazing heat receded and Lyca spent her entire first evening looking for a single electric light, anywhere on the horizon. She saw nothing. The stars above her shone with almost the same intensity as the starscape on the dark side of the Moon. 

The next day the sun rose, and with it came a heat, unlike anything Lyca had ever experienced before. It must have been nearly 120 degrees by 10 AM, and getting hotter by the moment. Eventually, Lyca was forced to jerry-rig the shattered hatch back onto the shuttle and use the remaining fuel to condition the air inside and keep cool. 

She lived this way for several days, spending the sunlit hours inside the ship, eating what rations remained, and the nights desperately searching for anyone in the wasteland. Each night, she would put up a flashing beacon, but no one came.

At the end of the 6th day, Lyca ate her final nutrient bar. She had a small amount of water left. She decided, if she did not see someone during the first couple of hours watch tonight, she would try to swim for the shore. 

But no sooner had she stuck her head up out of the ship, then she saw a distant light approaching in the water. It was not electric, but flickered orange, like a flame. As it got closer, Lyca saw that it was a small row boat, rowed by two anxious figures. They were armed, one with an ancient looking rifle, the other with a sharp stick. 

Lyca tried to speak to them in standard English, but the two men did not understand. The one with the rifle pointed at Lyca threateningly and gestured toward the boat. She took his meaning and carefully climbed down to him, even as the man with the spear climbed up and into the ship, combing it for useful salvage. 

Despite being held at gunpoint, Lyca was happy to see another living soul. She even felt herself begin to relax in the boat, bobbing on the water gently. After all, look where she was, floating on an *ocean*, breathing real, natural *air*, on *Earth* of all places. Sure it was blazing hot, a shadow of its former self, but Helsing help her, at least it was not the moon. 

At the thought of her old home, Lyca looked up. The white rock was blocked by a cloud and only the rounded top and bottom of the circle were visible to her. 

As she watched the cloud slowly pass in front of her pitiable home world, her mind recalled the ancient texts - "I, Lycanthrope," "The Hunts of Van Helsing," "Encyclopedia Lycanthia." How ridiculous they all seemed to her now, here on the world they'd abandoned. 

And for what? Absurd superstition and fear. For that, they chose to live, trapped and alone, isolated on a ball of gray dust? 

"Was it worth it father?!" Lyca screamed up at the veiled Moon. The man with the rifle raised it up threateningly, but Lyca did not care just then. She was angry, angry at her family, at her government, at her entire civilization. They were cowards and fools and they had taken the cowardly way out. 

"Well, you were wrong," she yelled up at them, "all of you! You're still trapped, and I'm â€” free," she said, the last word quieter, to herself. 

"Free," she whispered.

No sooner had the word left her lips, then the clouds parted above her, revealing the fullness of the moon in all its pallorous beauty. At the mere sight of it, Lyca's breath hissed from her lungs. Her heart began to race, her veins to dilate and pump, her muscles to throb and pulsate beneath her skin. Something was happening to her, something ancient and terrible, something which had not happened in over a thousand years.

From inside the ship, the man with the spear heard a scuffle, a scream, and then the splash of something heavy falling into the water. He yelled for his companion in their language. When there was no answer, the man inched his way out of the hatch and froze in horror, gaping at the moonlit, black-furred beast in the boat.

Frothing, the monster loosed a long, wet roar from its blood-soaked maw. Then it leaped and was upon him.
