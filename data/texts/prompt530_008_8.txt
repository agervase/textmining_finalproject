"Guild master?" Godwyn hesitantly asked by the door

"Fetch me that acolyte, they've been doing some... interesting things of late" I gently responded, "oh and one more thing"

I noticed Godwyn catching his breath as I stopped him at the door "uh, yes sir?". I stared at him for a long moment before dismissing him "Don't worry about it, report to Jeeves when you are done. Because this is to do with a guild member we shan't involve reception or non essential staff. August only knows how difficult guild bureaucracy makes these simple tasks."

"Yes sir, I'll use discretion", I smiled, "good, see to it I hear from you soon" Godwyn nodded and ducked out the door, his hurried footsteps echoing in the air. "He seeks a way out of my blackmailing" I chuckled motioning for the person behind the veil of reality to reveal themselves. "Impeccable sense as always Aelgrääd" chimed the shadowscale, arrogant as usual I could tell too "Had I not known you were there, I assume you would have attempted for my life. So lets skip the brown nosing and tell me why you seek my presence" the shadowscale visibly shrinked in disgust at my use of a human colloquialism, "The firstborn summons you to the keeper's place", I paused "when?" Resuming his infuriatingly joyous speech at delivering this news he lazily replied "now, time is growing short for you wayward kin."

I glowered, the keeper's place was the ancestral home of dragonkin, to go there was one of the most revered and sacred endeavours for our kind. It was also the place where traitors were brought to rest as atonement for their sins, we are indeed a very independent people, but there are a set of edicts designed to preserve the sanctity and longevity of the dragon race. One of them included to avoid immersing ourselves in alien culture and abandoning our territories, if a traitor dragon assisted a foreign race to exterminate dragonkind... they'd be very successful. "I do not seek abandonment of my charge, brother" I added brother heavily, anger propelling my words. "My place here is not one that forgets the call of the ones before us", continuing I pushed the dagger of words home "In fact I do not see you resuming your duties after your poor vigil resulted in generations being laid waste by common adventurers, do you not see the value in what I do here?"

The shadowscale hissed, his position as messenger resulting from a great disgrace many years ago, crippling his pride. It was a cheap blow, but still effective "It is not for me to say, you must come to the keeper's place. But it seems to me that you are more lost than I was originally informed, at least that is what the firstborn will hear" Steam hissed out of his mouth and nostrils, his fire quelled by a water curse as punishment for his catastrophic failure, such humiliation can drive a dragon to deep lows in character.  I returned a throaty chuckle, "you'd be a fool to think your snake tongue will weave it's way around the wisdom of the first, leave me now, I intend to stay." In truth I was not sure if the firstborn would believe him, however with his self confidence lower than it would ever be, any doubt I could feed him now would make his story less believable when he tries to construct it.

&#x200B;

Nothing more was said, the shadowscale 'stepped' into the veil and was gone moments later. I wonder how he felt being compared to our cousins suffering the eternal punishment, "snakes" as humans called them, ignorant to the true nature of that inferior existence. In a rare act of cultural mingling our kind has also started using the term, making human speech somewhat more palatable. I pushed such idlings aside and began to write a guild quest, I didn't have much time if the firstborn take my act of defiance as outright treachery. Hours later I was interrupted from my drafting by a knock on the door behind the bookshelf, the secret entrance. It must be that acolyte.
