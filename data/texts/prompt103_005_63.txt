I have lived for ages.


At some point, humans began to stop aging at 18. The old generation started to die out, with the new taking in knowledge and grow via experience, but keeping their physical prime, most of them. There were a select few that still aged, whatever the reason. Some loved and embraced this new life. Some hated and cursed it, stating that it wasn't right. It didn't matter what anyone thought, however. This was how it was going to be from now on. The Freeze, people named it.


Then someone had reached eureka. Found the pattern. Why some began to age again after The Freeze. The scientist presented her work to the world, and that was when humanity had realized what was happening. It was love. When one met their soulmate and truly fall in love, and the love is given back, The Freeze would be lifted. The curse broken. 


Too bad I didn't consider it a curse. 


I too am human. Before all this knowledge and experience, I too have fallen in love. Countless times over centuries. No one knows. Every time I ran into someone that could've been, could've been the one. The perfect one. My soulmate. I was torn into pieces everytime.


My agenda was to save humanity. To save it from it's own folly. It's own foolishness. To gain immense knowledge and wisdom, and watch over them from the shadows. To guide them to a better future. I didn't consider The Freeze a curse, far from it. It was a blessing. To give up love and protect the world. Save the Earth, nurture it back to health after all the hurt we've done.


So I killed my emotions. It killed me every single time. I wished the meetings never happened. Coincidential happenings, planned by friends, it mattered not. I couldn't risk it. It killed me... so I killed my feelings. I killed them every time, all of them. Potential lovers... potential soulmates. To gain immortality.


Now here I am. Ruling the world from the shadows, making the world a better place. Made it a better place. No wars. No poverty. The planet breathes fresh. Waters run clean. Life thrives everywhere. Smiles everywhere. 


But I am broken. Do I go on? Can I go on? These questions remain unanswered. I know not... I know nothing anymore. I go out from my palace, to take a walk in the forest. To see what I have accomplished, to give myself a sense of pride and achievement, to fill these feelings of void and emptiness.

Who is this? What is she doing here? Lost, she says. Well, well. Centuries of assisting humanity, this one will be no different. She looks wretched, tired. Beaten. Do not worry, I will care for you, young one. What is your name? 


Natalie.


... ...


It has been a while. Nearly a year, to be precise. I had much to think, much to ponder. I now stand at a crossroads. I... I have done much I regret, and much I take pride in. Now... maybe it is time to lay down my pen and sword. Natalie has fully recovered in body and mind, and will most likely take leave soon. Unless... she has stated her mind and feelings before. Maybe... just maybe. But... do I deserve it? Deserve this? Deserve her?
