(I made a thing but ran out of steam halfway through.)

-----

Hell was, stereotypically, unpleasant. 

Its soil was dry and abrasive, grating against my skin as the rest of my body was assaulted by harsh, cold winds. My face felt like it was being ground against the burning sand, the air feeling like icy knives plunging into my lungs. I had lost feeling in my feet, the monstrous hand was clutching it like a choking, meaty vice. And through it all, her words ran riot through my mind. What bet? What had I done to stand out to her? My mind's eye turned, inexorably, to the tattoos running down my arm, designed after long nights of study. 

I would cut it off, afterwards - if there was an afterwards.  
I would take my knife - my best one, the one with inlaid symbols and graven images - and purge the corruption from my body, sacrifice the flesh to save the soul. 

I was dragged on, my eyes shut to protect them from the razorous earth. Can it be called earth if it isn't from there? Unholy terra, maybe. My night-robes were being shredded, good silk turning to tatters. I had paid good money for it, been assured of its protection from the fiercest of djinni and afrits. I would curse the vendor, but I suspected nobody who discovered his ware's weakness were left in a fit state to.

My legs were leased, thudding down onto the unholy terra with a rush of pins and needles. Throwing my body sideways, my burned face was exposed to frigid air that at least numbed the pain. My eyes cracked open, giving me a mass of blurred shapes swirling and swimming in pale light. 

"Take him!" the demon's voice commanded. "He is defiled and filthy, corrupt and wretched. Even now he would mutilate his flesh to escape, and bears the mark of Kairos. His soul is forfeit!"

Another voice answered, a deep rumble spoken slowly but reverberating into my bones. "**KAIROS, YOU SAY? I HAVEN'T HEARD OF HIM.**"

"He is of the Sixth Circle, an archdemon of knowledge an conspiracy, secret plots and whispered fortunes. You wouldn't know if him, unless he wishes it."

**"YOU'RE MAKING IT UP."**

"Lies and deception have no place in this! The man is degenerate filth, his soul will buy you much favour and-"

**"HIS MARK RUBBED OFF."**

"Uh-"

**"AND HIS ROBES ARE MADE IN CHINA. DID YOU THINK YOU COULD FOOL ME, FOOLISH YOUTH? NO. YOUR DEBT STANDS."**

"but-"

**"I WILL HEAR NO MORE. RETURN THIS NECROMANTIC TOURIST, AND BRING ME A SOUL OF WORTH. IT WAS NOT I WHO CLAIMED SHE COULD BEAT ME AT FIRE-SWIMMING. AND CLEAN YOUR CAVE, IT'S A DISGRACE."**

"*I HATE YOU!*"

**"I HATE YOU TOO. NOW SEND THAT BACK, CLEAN OUT YOUR CAVE, AND BE DOWN FOR SIX, YOUR MUM GOT SOME GOOD SINNERS FOR DINNER AND I WON'T HAVE YOU DISRESPECTING HER."**
