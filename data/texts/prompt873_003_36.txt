"Another one. ANOTHER!" the king roared in anger. The palace square was in perennial maintenance and the palace itself was in disarray. The pillars broken and the residences in shambles, the once proud capital of the sea was destroyed entirely. The rage of the citizens had risen exponentially since the first blast. Ever since, they'd searched for the place to blame. Earth Scholars, men who were well versed with the kingdoms above, found and pinpointed the spot. Pyongyang, North Korea. The place was mapped out. Media about and from the country was researched. Soon every citizen knew about the situation overseas. And they waited, daring the demons above to strike. Today was that day, the day they would regret their decision. For life.

Troops readied themselves. The army and the navy prepared, as the entire Atlantis waited for the signal of war. With one confident shout and a flourish, the battle was on. Screams and war cries could be heard, as the entire forgotten city went forward to war. To save their country.

Above, above. The water was swept apart as the troops below swayed forward and back, like a syncronized water dance. They were one with the water, one with the elements. The only citizen deserving of God. And by God today the siegers would fall.

The light approached. Faster, faster. The troops basked in the glow of the sun, the first glance in their entire lives. Finally, the world would know who they were. The fear of the seas, *Atlantis*. But the light...it was getting too bright...

From below, the king looked in pure shock, horror and anger as the perfectly timed strike tore through the men like paper. He stared at the ensuing annihilation and destruction. A bone-splitting cry that could shatter souls rang through the kingdom. Alone, again. Alone by the same terrorizing explosive.

At least it didn't hit the palace again, he thought.
