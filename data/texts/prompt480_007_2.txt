I knew the day would come. Living off the land, an "offgrider" for lack of better terms had got me through alot of the wars we as humans put on ourselves. I was distant. My own little world so to speak. I could grow vegtables and hunt. I only took what I needed. I raised some chickens and had a very good supply of food. I remember sitting in the sun. Listening to the birds sing. Thinking of my son back in the big city on his daily grind and his mother, who I split ways with from unfortunate events. Yes, I am still human and love my sons mother no matter circumstance. I had been hoping my boy would be spending the summer months with me and I could help him release from the connected and wired world. Young men need guidenace and support. I'm sorry I must sound like a babbling fool. Life has changed. I only write this because I hope it will one day find the right person. Who will understand. 
Something happened and I'm not quite sure what is going on, but my watch and time has seemed to stop. I was out foraging late evening last night and saw a beam of light. It was fast. Very fast. I decided to check the spot I had seen it land or fall or whatever you would like to call it. I made my way down the valley to the spot I had thought the light had landed. The sun was almost down and dusk was on me faster then I had thought it would catch up. Stumbling across some underbrush I noticed a box with what seemed like initials on it. KOD. KOD i had no idea what they meant. I always come prepared and so I broke the box open. It wasn't easy. I suspect it was some sort of metal but I did not recognize it. Inside was a mask, double sided with canisters and also a handgun. And a note. The note read: : "if you are reading this, take care.". That was it. My mind raced and I was wondering what is this?
