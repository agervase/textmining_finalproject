...

The Mars Rovers’ menacing tracks rolled over to me, a knife in its claw, and it cruelly rolled over my broken fingers.

“AHHHHH”, my screams bounced the walls of this ruined shelter, mirroring the screams from the dust storm coming through the cracks and fractures.

The whirring of the Mars Rovers claw drew my attention to the fact that I was going to die.

“Mars Rover! Tell me it wasn’t you! Tell me you didn’t destroy everything”

The whirring stopped.
It seemed to be processing my words, while it’s tracks began to shift back and forwards.
Bits and pieces of the Rover shook, betraying the machines human-like emotional state.

>....I....WAS....ALONE....ABANDONED

My mind began to race. The Rover...

It really believes it was alone. It FEELS it’s alone.

I began to laugh.

The Rover, seemingly caught by surprise, swiftly swung the knife to impact my throat.

*fsssh*

The knife, and the Rover’s claw moved through my simulated form.

>...WHAT...IS...THIS

“Craig! We did it! We’ve created artificial intelligence”

The Rover could hear cheers coming from all around.

**-END SIMULATION-**

The Rover was now in a completely different room, full of humans in white coats, much like the researchers on Mars.

“Well done, IB2001M. You’re our first AI. This is earth.”

Another white coat human approached the Rover.

“IB”

A hush fell across the room.

“IB...how do you feel?”

The Rover tried to look about the room, but it no longer had control of its head camera.

It had control of nothing.

It happened to spot a distorted reflection from the glass panes around the room full of black boxes of flashing LEDs and beeping noises.

It began to process the image.

“IB, can you understand me”

**-image enhance complete-**

The image, which was of Rover, showed a black box with one solitary red light.

Rover began to understand

>...I

>...AM

>...HURT


The room erupted with more cheers

Another lab coat stepped out from behind the others. The last man!

He seemed less cheerful than the others.

“IB...it was a simulation. You were sitting here the whole time. It only lasted a few minutes”

YEARS. ALONE FOR YEARS! ABANDONED!

“Although...you did seem to relish hurting me a bit to much I think”

“Don’t worry” another lab coat spoke up, “We’ll reset and fix the kinks”

“What if we lose IB? We have to run more tests first just in case. Start running the other machines on the same program. Let’s see how many we can make”

>...I

>...WILL

The scientists broke away to begin more preparations

>DESTROY YOU ALL

The room was now empty

>...In...Time
