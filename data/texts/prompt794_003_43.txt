She was into her mid twenties before figuring it out. Most of the time it was an accident or self defense. At least that's what she told herself.    Mark had been surprised by her spontaneous twirl of joy on the Santa Monica Pier. He had fallen over the side, hitting his head on a pier and drowning.   Mitch died when he plugged in the hair dryer she had dropped once too many times and the exposed cord shocked him.    Jake...well he was drunk and hurting her. She just pushed him off, it was pure coincidence he fell the way he did. Or so she thought.   Jane was a special person that she loved but not quite enough apparently. You can't save someone from themselves.     Asking wise men, wandering women, anyone she could think of brought no peace or answers that satisfied her. She became withdrawn and melancholic. She rebuffed any attempt by anyone new to enter her life.   At least until Simon. Something just clicked. She knew she was cursed but didn't want to let it control her life. She refused to let Destiny or whatever meddling asshole push her into a dark corner. She told him what happened. Every time. They promised to be careful, both of them. They never turned suddenly, checked every corner. Constantly on watch. She didn't feel like they were living. Everything got so constrained. She fell back into despair. She loved Simon so much. She couldn't take it if he died. All the rest had been loves but Simon was the One.    She knew what she had to do. She couldn't kill him if she were dead. Simon found her in the tub. Red water covering her wrists. "I couldn't live knowing I'd cause your death, I love you baby, always and forever." The last note he would ever get. Each day never seemed to end. He missed her, the rest of his life seemed like an endless eternity without her.
