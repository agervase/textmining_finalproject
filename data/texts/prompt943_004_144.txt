"Good god how did we ever reach space travel working with this garbage?" One voice grumbled, the audio quality was not great but it was clearly the voice of a woman. A grating laughter rumbled out through the speakers as another spoke "They managed. It wasn't like we jumped straight from fire to nanofactories you know.".

Around the room we all had different looks on our faces as we processed what we were hearing. Some looked amused, others angry, both probably figuring this was a practical joke of some sort. The few that looked worried were, like me, fully aware that this was no joke. The pottery segment we'd scanned had come from a newly discovered settlement that, if carbon dating was to be believed, predated our earliest signs of civilization by several hundred years. A few subtly began running diagnostics on the translation system, clearly hoping something was wrong. It was a monumental achievement creating a system to analyze the minute etchings underneath the surface glaze, and then crafting an AI to piece together all of the data in an attempt to build a language index and translate it over, but every test showed that the system worked flawlessly.

"Yeah, well, if it weren't for those jackasses on Aretes, we'd be able to use the equipment from our ships! What were they thinking?!" the first voice, clearly frustrated, ground out. There was a pause, and something that sounded like a scratchy sigh. "Jass, you know we had to throw it all away...they can sniff out even small electrical signatures from light years away. The only chance we had to survive was to throw it all away. We couldn't fight what they made.".

It was at this point that the looks of worry became near panic...but things did not truly trip over into horror until we heard that voice continue "It was either this or be hunted down to extinction. With luck, our children will not forget these lessons.".
