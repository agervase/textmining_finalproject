Eyes narrowing in confusion, she stares at the person before her. Moments of silence balloon to fill the space between them before she finds her voice: "I...I'm sorry. But there must be a mistake. I don't know you."

The other girl tilts her head, ringlets of brown hair cascading onto her shoulder.  "You do, Claire.  You know me better than anyone else. But this is the first time you're really seeing me."  She pauses. "Not a reflection, not a photograph, but me."

Processing the information, Claire feels her chest tighten. "But, but you're so pretty," she finally manages, voice tainted with tears. 

Other Claire sighs quietly. "Because you're pretty. You've just never believed it. And you hurt yourself so badly because of that."

Lowering her head, Claire protests, "It wasn't that bad," but there's no real conviction.

"Those summers you spent eating 500 calories a day to lose weight you didn't have? Or clawing at your face whenever you saw a blemish? Or all the time you spent in front of a mirror, finding more and more flaws?" Other Claire is crying now, softly. "You hated yourself for so long, you didn't believe it when people told you otherwise. Until you sunk so low that you finally ended it all."

Claire flushes and stares at her wrists, at the long, thin cuts the extend from her palm to half up her forearm.

"They miss you," Other Claire whispers. "Your family, your friends. You whole life was ahead of you. Of us. And you just...just gave that all up."

She wants to respond, to justify herself, but she's sobbing too hard, and besides, she knows there's no justification for what she's done. "I'm so so-sorry," she finally chokes out.

"I know," Other Claire says gently, pulling her into a hug. 

"Do...do you forgive me?" she barely even breathes, too afraid of the answer.

"Not right now. But I will." Other Claire takes her hand and leads her across the misty landscape.  In the distance, a city glitters gold. "We have all the time in the world."
