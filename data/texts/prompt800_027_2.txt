I know it's a little late to the party but this one just struck a chord. New to the whole writing thing so criticism is welcome :) now enjoy






It was weird to see someone with a body so perfect and smooth. She stood out in the at the bar straight away. It took me ten minutes to realise, although everyone was glancing at her, she was staring at me. I'm glad I found the courage to say something because 'that' was amazing. And now we're at her place and she's lying next to me. 

As she looked up at me from within the satin sheets I started running my finger tips across her soft body. I traced up her right arm to her shoulders. Although they were quite pronounced they still felt smooth, I still couldn't get over how she had no scars. I carried tracing up to her neck, I grazed her face with the back of my hand and she smiled that crooked smile. I dropped my hand down her bac... 

That's when I felt it.

The ridge started at the bottom of her neck and ran down her back, jumping back and forth across her spine and stopped an the small of her back. I couldn't believe it at first. And as she pulled away from me I knew something was wrong. 

She slipped off the bed taking the sheets with her and now I could see it in its full glory before she slipped into the bathroom.

It was fairly fresh, can't have been more than a week old. About an inch wide at its thickest. What had she said. What possible lie could she have told to have deserved that. She then emerged from the bathroom fully clothed and rushed to the door. 

"What did you lie about?" I asked, my voice trembling with doubt. 
She just stood there with the door open looking at me for what felt like an eternity and that's when she said it. 

"They asked me if I'd killed anyone" 
And with that, she left.
