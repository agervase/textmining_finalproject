Aight, I'll throw something together before I fall asleep. Wont be the best formatted stuff, but hey, the story has to escape my tired mind.

Edit for some words.

A bright light suddenly appeared and blinded Richard, then came a short but very loud crashing sound followed by complete darkness... for a second. Another bright light appeared, this time with a red tint to it. 

He opened his eyes, still utterly confused as to why his car-seat had vanished below him. He could see nothing but the light, and he felt something wrapped around his head.

-"What... The... Kitten..." Richard mumbled, then caught on to the word that came out of his mouth.

-"Wha..."

-"You can't say bad words in Heaven, sorry about that." said a familiar female voice beside him in a dull tone. 

-"Hea..." Richard muttered, before being interrupted by the voice.

-"You're dead, you went to heaven, welcome and all that. If you're wondering how you got here it waaaas... hang on. Yeah, a 2016 Mack Granite cement truck at 69,053912 miles per hour. It also says it wasn't your fault, which is surprising to me". Richard now realized who the voice belonged to.

-"Yeah, okay... that was oddly specific, but thanks, *sis*." Richard said with a dull tone of his own. "I didn't reckon you'd be up here. Did you escape from the part cordoned off for insufferable gummybears? Oh for... Ahh this will get old really quick." 

-"Yes, of course I did. No, You're in a reception facility, and the reason you can't see much is because we've decided that new arrivals are better off that way for reasons I'm about to explain to you."

-"We? Are you management here or something? Can I choose to go to hell instead? Please?"

-"You're as much management as I am, Brother, and no you can't escape this place".

-"You're worrying me. I'm in heaven and I'm worried."

-"Since you're being difficult with me I'll just go ahead and remove your blindfold straight away, you're family after all. Enjoy, *Richard*." 

And off the blindfold came.

-"Toddler Pancake Puppy KITTEN KITTEN KITTEN!"

-"Yupp. Kitten sounds about right."

-"WHY THE KITTEN WOULD HE DO THAT?!"

-"Modern culture, actually."

-"Oh... God?"

-"He was omnipotent, as you may have read, he heard and saw everything every single human said or did."

-"Poor sap... oh wow..."

-"He was fine with the wars, the death, the starvation, stuff he'd seen from day one more or less. He viewed them as necessary to human development. What got to him in the end was Nicki Minaj, that Thift Shop song and Fidget Spinners. The day he did it he had just witnessed a Youtube Video where a guy named Todd blew vape-smoke onto a fidget spinner to watch the funny patterns it made. Two months ago, I believe." 

-"I have no words."

-"Would you like to know his last words?"

-"Sure..."

-"Kitten this."

-"Of course."

-"Well, you always got on my nerves downstairs and I can tell you'll get on my nerves up here as well, so I'm going to leave you to get accustomed to the surroundings by yourself. Good luck with that, there's an information folder on the chair beside you when you're ready to start exploring."
 
-"Kitten off."

-"Gladly."

What lay before Richards eyes was heaven. Paradise scenery stretched out below his position on a mountainside retreats veranda, he could see a million miles out and it was strikingly beautiful. Doubtlessly a glorious place six weeks ago he thought, as he stared at what sat on top of an impossibly large mountain very much visible to everyone below. God was approximately the size of Earth, and very dead. In one hand the size of France was a sawed off shotgun the size of south america. His head was almost gone and the fluffy previously white clouds above him splattered with his divine gore for what must have been tens of thousands of miles, his flowing white robes and golden throne were covered in blood.

No sign of decay at all. A gentle breeze brought the smell of brains with it.

-"Kitten", Richard said.
