Never tired this before.

My watch has been broken for about 10 days. I've worn watches all my life, but it's been an accessory at most. It's not done me well to think about time.

It's been 197 years since she vanished. I thought nothing was wrong to start with. I was sad that she was moving away. Her making me promise to not die didn't seem to be anything but a joking moment between friends. For those three years after that she got quieter and quieter. By the time I realised three years had passed, she had gone. Nobody seemed to remember her. She disappeared. The man she went to live with all that time ago simply kept going to work, carrying out his typical routine. He never had another partner, but he also didn't seem at all phased about this missing person. Nobody called to check for her. She had simply vanished, leaving me still pondering those last words to me, the only one who acknowledged she was gone.

I didn't notice that I stopped aging that day. Not the day she made me promise, but the day she disappeared. My hair doesn't grow nor grey normally. My skin doesn't wrinkle in time like it should. I'm as healthy as I was. Aside from the hiccups where I age slightly- some days I seem to gain a spot, or a single grey hair, out of nowhere.

Nowhere isn't the best word. I've had enough times to realise why it happens now. The moment that she leaves my thoughts, I begin to die. Slowly, but surely, the weight of the years catches up. It's been nothing but a cruel trick. 

She has condemned me to this life. I can't die because I can't stop thinking about her. I can't do anything with my extra time because if I forget, we both die. I have been stuck, buying watch after watch, breaking them in anger, each one a reminder of the time I have been forced to survive through.

Tomorrow I'll buy another watch.
