Fuck off Sandra, its stupid o'clock in the morning and I havent even woken up yet. I dont want to hear about your kids again. Give me an hour, at least. Of course I would never say this to her. Shes a good kid, I say kid shes older than me but whatever.

And the day starts. I walk upstairs, say my hellos, chat to Tony about whatever he's chatting shit about today (why they let him work here i'll never know) grab my coffee, and head to my office. Well, office is a strong word. Imagine a room, with like 5 highly secure doors, and inside the room is a desk and security monitor. Thats about it. Think "Monsters vs Aliens" and you're pretty much there. I'm an over-glorified security guard. Long hours, but decent pay. My job is to make sure the 5 "beings" that are there A) Are happy, and B) Dont try to break out and kill us all, so no pressure right.

I open up door number one. Inside is what some cultures would call a God. Immortal, un-imaginable power, you name it this guy has it. Diseptato-en-something-or-other (Dez for short) destroyed worlds, was worshiped, and took retirement in flipping Sheffield. Whatever, not my kettle to open.

> "All right Dez, hows it going"

He puts down his drink and floats over to me.

> "Did you see that ludicrous display last night? Every time we had the ball..."

And so begins the 10 minute rant about how United lost, or didnt score, or whatever. This is fine by me, as a football fan myself its great. Keeps the mind active you know.

> "...Should never be playing for the national team. Sorry mate, I know you got shit to do, we'll talk later"

Dez is a good guy. He knows why he's here, accepts that im just doing my job, and gets on with it. Hopefully they go easy on him. The same cant be said, for door number two...
