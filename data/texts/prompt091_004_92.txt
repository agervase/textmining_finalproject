"Janus, what do you think you're doing?"

Janus Kirkpatrick raised a brow at the question, the stacks of beige boxes and double-wrapped containers obvious evidence as to his actions. 

"Stocking. What'd you *think* you're *doing?* Don't you have a shipment of ferns to take care of?"

Vincent DeFris waved a hand absently, scoffing. "Those fuckers can wait around for a little bit more. No one except some old granny will mind if they don't get their fern plants. Nah, I'm here 'cause there's someone here looking for ya."

Janus moved a box off the pallet and onto a waiting u-boat, grunting at the weight.

"Is it Jim? You can tell him that the box of nails he was looking for is on the break room table."

"No, it ain't him. It's some Mexican fella, says he's from Caracas wherever that is."

"Caracas..." Janus muttered. "Vinny, you stupid sack of shit. Caracas isn't even in Mexico, it's in Venezuela. And no, that's not the annoying horn you heard at the FIFA world cup. And what does he even want?"

DeFris shrugged, leaning against a stack of wooden pallets with his hands in his pockets. "Fucked if I know. Said something about destabilizing the economy. Christ, I thought you said you flunk Econ 201? I didn't figure you'd fuck up that bad."

"Heh, very funny, Vinny. Now go fuck a cactus, or something as similar. Maybe a porcupine? He's in the break room you said?"

Vincent DeFris nodded, easing off the pallets and moving towards his garden department. "Yeah, I hope you speak Spanish, cause he's yammering about things like 'Destabilizing the Bolivar, crippling South American interests in the near and far future.' Weird Mexican shit man."

Janus sighed with exasperation, as Vinny vanished around a corner. "He's from Venezuela, you dumb fuc- Oh forget it, it's like trying to wipe your ass with your elbows; you won't succeed and you'll just spread shit everywhere."
