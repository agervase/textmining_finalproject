It started slowly. Smudged and even shattered glasses and plates, uncleaned linens, and general neglected duties; Vrarren chalked their discordance up to mistakes or accidents. But his theory was quickly thrown out of the window when he walked into the restaurant’s kitchen during a dinner rush to find a chef spitting into a dish.

 Vrarren didn’t understand why they were upset. He had given them everything that he could afford. Sure it wasn’t the best stuff, but they were only humans. And the trader told him that humans were very adaptable, so why weren’t they “adapting” to their new job. He couldn’t think of a single reason for why they refused to cooperate.

As the months passed, the humans became even more uncooperative. Doing an apathetic job if they even chose to do it in the first place. The amount of guests severely dwindled and the bills piled up. Vrarren heard whispers among the humans about what would happen to them when the resort went out of business. They talked about it as if they were almost hopeful.

Seething with anger, he had thought he did all he could for the humans. They hated him, they hated their work. Nothing turned out the way he hoped it would. He knew this, he was told by everyone not to trust them. That they were hard to work with. But he got a great deal and that was difficult to pass up. 

As the days went by, the humans rebelled more and more. It felt as if they were doing this to spite him. They wanted to see him go out of business, they must have. He could no longer afford them or the site itself. He could’ve left them to rot on the resort instead, but he wanted to be the better being. With the last of his finances, he arranged a spaceship to send them away.

When it touched down, he lead the 500 onto the loading dock, telling them that it would take them wherever they wanted to go. He turned back towards the bankrupted and abandoned resort and started walking, smiling to himself as he heard the ship take off back to the trader’s location.
