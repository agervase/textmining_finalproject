Everyone knew the rules, once you turned 18 one of the gods or goddesses would grant a gift of great power consisting of Magic or Weapons. Well today's my 18th birthday, and I can't wait. Maybe I'll get Loki's dagger, or Poseidons trident! Imagine if I get granted Zeuses lightning! Suddenly a eerie sensation overcame me. Goosebumps and spine chilling sensation for what seemed like no reason. A raspy breath came from right behind me. I let out a tiny yelp from surprise before quickly turning around. A skeleton in a tattered black robe with glowing blue eye stood before me. In that same raspy voice it spoke, "Happy birthday, I believe this belongs to you young one. But before I go, I must..." Before Death could finish his sentence I already had my hand wrapped around the Scythe he held out to me. "Thank you, for I really needed this vacation." My fingertips began sizzling as if dipped in boiling oil, the skin and flesh turning to ash, only leaving bone. The sizzling began spreading throughout my entire body leaving me a walking skeleton. Death tore down a curtain off a nearby window and and handed it to me. "You can't do this to me! I'm 18, I have my whole life ahead of me and you mutilated me and expect me to fill in for your job!?!?" I shouted. Death let out a chuckle, and said "Young one, have you noticed anything odd today? Like have you eaten anything or drink anything or any other bodily functions humans typically do?" "I... No, I guess not." I muttered. Death pointed to my bed in the corner. On it lay a body, MY BODY, in a contorted position, foam seeping out the lips. Death spoke again "You were so excited for this day, young one. So excited it caused a little weak vessel in your brain to split open, killing you early this morning. I guess you can call it a stroke of bad luck..." Death turned around and began walking back in the direction it came in."I'll be back for my scythe when I return from my vacation!"
