"Did he attacked you in any way ?
- Well, how could I...

-Okay little boy, she said, staring at him with her lagon blue eyes, you're not in your castle, with your Daddy. You're in my tower. I ask the questions, you answer them, it's easy.

-O.. Okay, he answered, shaking"

The young lady sighed, before sitting on a nearby chair, reajusting her crown on her blonde head.

"-Let's start again, she said, visibly bored, did Farin attacked you ?

-No.

-No, *who* ? She asked, angrily.

-No, Princess ? He answered, hesitant.

Suddenly the princess burst out, laughing. The young men decided to try asking a question, surprised by her reaction. Suddenly, the atmosphere was lighter.

-What ?

-All these years, she responded, still laughing, lords, counts and princes had come here to save me from some great evil, and then... you ! You have no idea of who I am, and you still came here ! What are you, a tourist who got lost ? You are lucky that I just fed Farin before you came ! 

-I... I guess. He said, shakened by the idea of himself being anywhere near one of the terrible monster's fangs.

-You, I like you. But still, I cannot free you, because now you know where I live...

-Please ! Don't kill me, I will help you ! I will do anything for you ! He said, panicked.

He didn't know who this princess was, but still he wanted to trust her. She didn't seem really different from him, actually, she looked... lost. At least as much as him.

-Anything ? She insisted, with a mysterious look.

-Yeah... he confirms, while running multiple similar scenarii in his head, all of them finishing quite bad.

-Did you hear about Pythia, the great oracle ?

-Yes ? That was a myth that you learned as a child, about someone who would see the future of everyone except hers. And then she would perish in an atrocious way, depending of who was telling the story.

-Well, hi, it's me. I reincarnated in this body. I lost all my powers, and I don't know where I am. Please, help me.
