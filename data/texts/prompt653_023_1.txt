Bright is the only way you could describe the *Limbo* nightclub. Amidst the cacophony of blaring, 25th-Century retro pop, and the hundreds, if not thousands, of doped and drunken partygoers, one could easily become disoriented in the winding mirror-like halls of the enormous complex. It was built almost like a temple, pyramidal in structure, with enough room, drink, and music to entertain an entire city's population for weeks on end. The top 200 floors of the building were reserved, however, for only one man. The Architect of the *Limbo* was not the most sociable of men; but for what he lacked in charisma, or geniality, he made up for with raw influence. Almost like unspoken law, it was known the most powerful man in the Kaiser Sea Cities was never to be trifled with. For the *Limbo* and the Architect were one, balanced ecosystem; like a king in his castle. 



And yet something disturbed this king in his solitude.


It started slowly. At first, the Architect would refuse his morning coffee from the service droids. A week later he wouldn't eat the food placed upon his table. He reclined into a trance-like stupor, refusing to see any of his attendants. A month later the *Limbo* was temporarily shut down, with the cover story of malfunctioning ventilation systems. Eventually the Architect shut himself into his personal chambers and forbade anyone from disturbing him, under the penalty of death.

And so the Architect sat, motionless; eyes deep-blue and seemingly staring into nothingness.

 Though he was wearing a simple suit, his tall, dark visage was apparently extraordinarily intimidating. He had learned this from the many gossip columns circulating through the city of New Chicago; tabloids were still a profitable venture in the 26th-Century. His subjects apparently needed distraction beyond what carnal pleasures the *Limbo* provided. The Office of the Architect was grand, but the many chairs and sofas were never filled with any guests of any sort, as he had no intention of seeing anyone for any reason. He sat at his rather enormous sandstone desk, embedded with tribal runes and carvings, upon which lay his vexation, his reason for denying the population of his city the wonders of *Limbo*. He looked down, glancing at the source of his self-inflicted exile.

A single gray hair.

The service droids had found it during his morning trim, and nearly had just dumped it into the garbage along with the rest of his hair, had it not been for The Architect's frantic pleas. The reason for his spontaneous obsession for his single decaying keratin follicle was not due to mental illness, as the droids had measured. No, it was a much older, and much darker part of the Architect's past. He tried not to think on it, but he remembered the terms he made all those years ago, what he had bargained for.

Softly, the words came back to him: 

*You shall have*

*the life you seek,*

*to control the lives*

*of the strong and weak.*

*You shall not age,*

*but ere come the day,*

*I shall return,*

*Upon your gray*.

Sighing deeply, he stood up from the chair and gazed out the viewport. In almost the millisecond he turned away from the desk, he felts all the hairs on his neck stand straight up, as if being held at gunpoint.


**"You hoped I wouldn't return"**, whispered the ghastly presence behind him. **"I thought you were the smart kind Virgil."**

The Architect turned to face his quarry. The Reaper had already made himself at home in one of the corner couches, reclined like a shadow, it's cloak billowing in the nonexistent wind. 

*"I thought I would have longer is all."* He paused for a moment, only to continue, *" I'm sure you get where I'm coming from."*

**'You have lived eight and two human lifespans, far beyond what you were originally......allotted. You were more fortunate than most.**"


*'Fortunate enough to build this, an Empire! My Empire. A testament to what Humankind could accomplish, simply with more time."*

Deeply, the umbral being chuckled.  **"A testament to Sins. Power. Domination. Lust. Avarice."**

The shadow-being leaped from the corner and took a accusatory stance. With it's bone-white fingers, it gesticulated in a passive, but poignant fashion, at the being before him. The Architect was on his knees now, almost pleading for a reprieve.

**"That is your failing. With your gift, you have created nothing. Nothing but a temple to Humanity's follies."**

Gracefully, and almost instantaneously, the Reaper produced it's namesake tool, and with one fell swoop, the specter's ghostly blade cleaved into the Architect's torso, and wretched the soul from within. Before the Architect's body could even hit the floor, the Reaper vanished, it's long bargain fulfilled. And upon the floor lay not a tall, intimidating man, but a shriveled husk; his true age revealed in death.

The *Limbo* opened it's doors again to the public not long after, it's pleasures and distractions needing, craving to be used by the vicious, sinning hordes. But a castle without a king, is no castle at all. The *Limbo* slowly decayed into even darker depths of depravity, and eventually the shining temple the Architect had labored for, had fallen into shadow.
