A bead of sweat rolls across my brow as I open my eyes. Visions blurry, a haze of red, brown and grey. Smells of ash and soot choke my senses as the heat assaults my skin. My vision's slowly repairing, and I can see mountains of flame, stretching further and further with every passing second, licking at the ceiling.

There is a man in the distance. He might know where we are. I'll approach. Getting closer I can see that he is no man. Man shouldn't have horns the size of my forearm. Man shouldn't have a reddish hue to the skin. Man shouldn't have jet black eyes. Man shouldn't be able to walk harmlessly on flame. This was no man. This was an ungodly beast. An ungodly beast that knew my name. How did it know my name?

"How do you know my name?"

"I know many things."

And ungodly beast that knew many things. Well that's just great.

"Do you know where we are?"

"Yes."

Well, that was helpful.

"Is there anyone else I can talk to?"

"No, everyone else left."

"Where did they go?"

"Upstairs."

Damn, stuck with the ungodly beast and his cryptic answers.

"Is there anyone else coming along?"

"No, the doors are locked."

The doors are locked? 

"Why are the doors locked?"

"There was a breach, so we've been sealed. You were the last one in."

"So it's just us?"

"Yes."

Why's he standing up? Wait! He's walking this way.

"W-When will the doors... uhmm"

Oh my god, what the fuck was I going to say.

"Uhh."

Oh good, you've pissed yourself. With a bit of luck he wont want to touch you.

"When will the doors u-unlock."

Show some respect.

"Sir."

Nailed it.

"Oh when they get breach sorted. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the end of time. Who knows."

He's so close. I can smell him. Wait. Whats he doing.

"Uhm Sir. Why are you touching my face."

Ouch! Shit, his nails are really sharp. Is that blood running down my face. 

"Sir?"

The pain, it's excruciating. Fuck, this really fucking hurts, and he's smiling at me.

"Sir! Please Stop! Why are you smiling?"

"Because I thought I would never get another chance to welcome someone too hell."

Also, just realised I didn't make any mention of a harmonica. Whoops.
