There are certain days that you look forward to for most of your life. Graduating from college, getting married, buying a house, witnessing the birth of your children, retirement. These are the temporal support beams upon which we build and create the memories of our lives. The size does not matter. Only magnitude â€” force. My strongest support beam came in the mail.

I received the first letter when I was ten years old. It came in a white envelope on a rainy Tuesday in October. It had no return address. The handwriting did not look familiar to me then, nor does it now. I was very excited to have a letter addressed to me. I didn't have very many friends at the time, being mostly bedridden since the diagnosis. It came at the same time each year, and always said the same thing:

*Dearest Everett,*

*You don't know me yet, but I know you. I live somewhere you can't see me. At least not yet. But please have patience. In 35 years we will meet and I will have much to tell you. Until then, know that you are cared for and that you are important.*

*Sincerely,*

*The Traveler*

Each year the content of the letter remained the same, except for the number, which counted downward, steadily toward zero. 

I received the last letter a few days ago. The message was the same, except under the normal body of the letter, there were instructions for me to meet at Danbury Park at noon, located just a few blocks from my house. 

I woke at dawn, my eyes snapping open as if programmed. I began the arduous process of getting dressed, slowly lifting myself from my power chair and down into the seated shower. Having finished, I dried and dressed myself and set about making myself a large breakfast, knowing that the meeting ahead would sap my small reserves of energy. Alongside breakfast I took my horribly bitter medication Eteplirsen, which helps me retain my strength and delays certain types of muscular degeneration. 

I rolled into the garage and got into my minivan, which allows me to steer, start, and stop with hand controls. I drove to the park and arrived 15 minutes early and sat, too nervous to move. The minutes ticked quickly by, and before I knew it, noon was upon me. Against every fiber of my being, I got out of the car and rolled to my favorite place in the park. The hanging flowers were faded in the fall time chill, but most of the vines were still intact. I sat in wait, looking for my mysterious caller to arrive. After twenty minutes I decided that my confidant had gotten just as nervous as I did, and, realizing I may have been led on a 35-year goose chase, I turned around. Standing a few feet in front of me was a full body mirror. I stared at my reflection and relief and disappointment washed over me. After a moment my silver-haired mother stepped from a vine-wrapped pillar, crying. She walked over to me and pressed my hand and lifted it to her lips and kissed it.

I looked at the mirror and smiled and said, "Hello time traveler. It's a pleasure to meet you."
