I looked up from the desk to see a tall man in a white suit enter the room. He smiled at me and began making a couple notes on the clipboard he was holding. He then set down the clipboard on the table for a second, before taking a seat on the other side of the desk.

“Hello there. My name’s Peter. You’re Alex, right?” He said, extending his hand.

“Y-yes” I stuttered, tentatively shaking his hand.

“How’re you feeling?”

“A little loopy, but...”

“No need to worry about that. It’s normal to feel a little shaken up in the transition between life and the afterlife, but you should have no problem getting into heaven, provided you complete a simple test first”

“There’s a test?”

“Not the type you’re thinking of I’m sure. All you have to do is have a little confrontation with the person you hurt the most. Sounds simple enough, right?”

“Um. I think so. We’re talking real people here right. I... um... wrote a few stories that didn’t really treat my characters the nicest. I always found suffering characters made for good storytelling. I just hope.”

“Oh no need to worry about that. I promise you the person you’re about to meet is quite real.

“Alright then. Sounds fantastic. Loving the spirit you got there. I’ll get you all set up in just a second.”

Peter stood up to exit the room, picking up his clipboard on his way out. And then there was silence. For eternity, I felt like I was waiting there for some hurt person to come through the door. Someone that I’d have another chance to help. It was actually quite nice, knowing I had could tie up a loose end that I’d left back on Earth. My pleasant disposition was quickly interrupted with a loud pounding noise coming from the other side of the door. I looked forward in suspense as the door in front of me swung open.

A young man stumbled through, hands clutching his head as he fell to the ground in front of the desk. His hair was a frazzled mess and his face appeared to be wet with tears. I could hear him whimper as he looked up at me. And despite his disheveled look, I had no trouble recognizing that I was staring into my own face. He began mumbling at me his words slurring as he spoke:

“What’re you looking at you crazy fuck.”

“I...uh”

“Yeah, you heard me. You’re nothing but a fucking maniac. Normal people don’t talk to themselves. Heh heh. Guess that makes me crazy too. Just super.”

“Um excuse me. What’s going on here? I was thinking...”

“Screw what you were thinking. You think you get to face some ordinary so in so, you screwed slightly in the past, you’re dead wrong. You spent so much time trying to care for others you forgot about caring for your damn self.”

“I was only trying...”

“To be the best person you could be. Yeah fantastic. I know what you were trying to do. But while everyone else was adoring how nice of a person you are, you never fucking helped yourself. You’re just some crazy writer who destroys himself with his own work.”

“But, I was just trying to vent into a creative outlet. Those stories...”

“Are tearing me apart. I can’t figure out who the hell I am any more when I find myself relating to omnicidal nihilistic maniacs and corrupt dictators that make deals with the devil. I can’t be like those people and yet I feel so similar to them. It’s just an endless cycle of confusion and hatred and I just can’t stand it. And it’s all your fault. It’s your fault I don’t know who I am!”

The doppelganger picked himself off the ground and leapt towards me. Instinctively, I dived out of the way and made a beeline for the door. Whatever the hell was going on, all I cared about was getting out of there. I burst out of the room and shut the door behind me finding myself in a large corridor lined with several unlabeled doors. Without thinking I opened the door across the hall and dove through.

I found myself in a dark room lined with computer screens, seemingly monitoring several deaths going on back at Earth. On one screen, an old woman lied in a hospital bed as her heart monitor shifted into a flatline. On another screen, I witnessed a drunk driver swerving down the road before careening off the edge of a bridge. However, it was the third scree that caught my eye.

At first glance, it was remarkably simple. A young man sitting in his room at a computer typing away. However, moments later, he slammed the computer shut and began walking towards his closet. After some digging, the man pulled a tick rope from the closet. I watched in horror as the man tied one end of the rope to a ceiling fan and wrapped the rest around his neck, forming a noose. And as  he hung there, I began to notice that the face on that man was all too familiar.

“No... it couldn’t be”

I stumbled backwards and ran out of the room back into the corridor. I turned to my left and ran as fast as I could. Nothing else mattered any more. Whatever kind of sick place this was, it was messing with my mind and I had to get out immediately. I randomly chose another door and ran through, never looking back. It led straight into another corridor. There was no logic in this place. And yet I continued running. Continued opening doors. And each time I found more corridors. There was no exit. There was no way out of this mess.

I cowered in the middle of a hallway and burst into tears. I was trapped here forever. I’d failed the test and now there was nothing left. I couldn’t even scream as I’d lost all my breath from trying to escape the ramblings of some alternate version of myself. And now, I was going to die here in these halls If I even could die in this afterlife transition hellhole.

I got up in anger and began pounding on the door next to me. I felt nothing but rage now and any sense in my mind had left me. No matter what I did, I wasn’t going to make it out. There was no exit. There couldn’t be. And suddenly, the door gave way and I fell through the opening.

I fell onto the floor before noticing that this door lead to somewhere different. No more corridors. But an office, not unlike the office I began in. I picked myself up off the ground and stare forward at a man sitting at the desk in the center of the room. I was staring into my own face. And I felt the anger stronger than ever. It was because of him I was in this mess. I had to face him. I would never get out of here if I didn’t. And so I spoke up:

“What’re you looking at you crazy fuck.”

“I...uh”

“Yeah, you heard me. You’re nothing but a fucking maniac. Normal people don’t talk to themselves. Heh heh. Guess that makes me crazy too. Just super.”

“Um excuse me. What’s going on here? I was thinking...”

“Screw what you were thinking. You think you get to face some ordinary so in so, you screwed slightly in the past, you’re dead wrong. You spent so much time trying to care for others you forgot about caring for your damn self.”

“I was only trying...”

“To be the best person you could be. Yeah fantastic. I know what you were trying to do. But while everyone else was adoring how nice of a person you are, you never fucking helped yourself. You’re just some crazy writer who destroys himself with his own work.”

“But, I was just trying to vent into a creative outlet. Those stories...”

“Are tearing me apart. I can’t figure out who the hell I am any more when I find myself relating to omnicidal nihilistic maniacs and corrupt dictators that make deals with the devil. I can’t be like those people and yet I feel so similar to them. It’s just an endless cycle of confusion and hatred and I just can’t stand it. And it’s all your fault. It’s your fault I don’t know who I am!”

I lost it. Right then and there. I couldn’t stand talking to this idiot any longer. He’d caused me too much pain. I was going to make him feel my pain. I lunged over towards the desk, aiming to strangle this clone. Reality didn’t matter to me any more. Nothing mattered but my anger, my hatred of this person who resembled me. I wanted to feel his throat close in my hands as he gasped for air. But I stumbled over the chair in front of the desk and missed him. He ran off into the corridors, shutting the door behind him. There was no way I was following him.

I gathered my bearings and exhaustedly sat down in the chair behind the desk, trying to sort out what was going on. Whatever it was, despite this promise of a simple path to heaven, I was feeling nothing but hell. Nothing but pain and suffering. I leaned over onto the desk, clenching my teeth, and screamed out in pain hoping that someone somewhere could save me.

And then the door creaked open.

I looked up from the desk to see a tall man in a white suit enter the room. He smiled at me and began making a couple notes on the clipboard he was holding. He then set down the clipboard on the table for a second, before taking a seat on the other side of the desk.

“Hello there. My name’s Peter. You’re Alex, right?” He said, extending his hand.

“Y-yes” I stuttered, tentatively shaking his hand.

“How’re you feeling?”

“A little loopy, but...”

“No need to worry about that. It’s normal to feel a little shaken up in the transition between life and the afterlife, but you should have no problem getting into heaven, provided you complete a simple test first...”
