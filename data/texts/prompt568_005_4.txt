FADE IN:

1 ON COMPUTER SCREEN 1

so close it has no boundaries.

A blinding cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a

heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath

the derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were

making the call. The cursor continues to throb,

relentlessly patient, until --

MAN (V.O.)

Yeah?

Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing

faster then we can read: "Call trans opt: received.

2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>."

WOMAN (V.O.)

Is everything in place?

On screen: "Trace program: running."

We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on

a third line. The man's name is Cypher. The woman,

Trinity.

 TRINITY (WOMANV.O.)

I said, is everything in place?

The entire screen with racing columns of numbers.

Shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a

10-digit phone number in the top corner.

CYPHER (MANV.O.)

You weren't supposed to relieve

me.

TRINITY (V.O.)

I know but I felt like taking a

shift.

The area code is identified. The first three numbers

suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

CYPHER (V.O.)

You like him, don't you? You like

watching him?

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each

digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like

the wheels of a slot machine.

1 CONTINUED: 1

TRINITY (V.O.)

Don't be ridiculous.

CYPHER (V.O.)

We're going to kill him. Do you

understand that? He's going to

die just like the others.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Morpheus believes he is the One.

Only two thin digits left.

CYPHER (V.O.)

Do you?

TRINITY (V.O.)

I... it doesn't matter what I

believe.

CYPHER (V.O.)

You don't, do you?

TRINITY (V.O.)

If you have something to say, I

suggest you say it to Morpheus.

CYPHER (V.O.)

I intend to, believe me. Someone

has to.

The final NUMBER POPS into place --

TRINITY (V.O.)

Did you hear that?

CYPHER (V.O.)

Hear what?

On screen: "Trace complete. Call origin: #312-555-

0690.

TRINITY (V.O.)

Are you sure this line is clean?

CYPHER (V.O.)

Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green

NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR.

TRINITY (V.O.)

I better go.

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the

nether world of the computer screen. Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in --

2 INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT 2

The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way

across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms

as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving

patterns of permanent shadow.

We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as

they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves

on either side of Room 303.

The biggest of them violently kicks in the door. The other

cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.

BIG COP

Police! Freeze!

The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a foldup table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a powerbook

computer. The only light in the room is the glow of the

computer.

Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is

TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

BIG COP

Hands behind your head! Now! Do

it!

She slowly puts her hands behind her head.

3 EXT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT 3

A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the

police cruisers. AGENT SMITH, AGENT BROWN, and AGENT

JONES get out of the car.

They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night. They

are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones

in one ear, the cord coiling back into their shirt

collars.

AGENT SMITH

Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT

Oh shit.

(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 4.

3 CONTINUED: 3

AGENT SMITH

Lieutenant, you were given

specific orders --

LIEUTENANT

I'm just doing my job. You gimme

that Juris-my dick-tion and you

can cram it up your ass.

AGENT SMITH

The orders were for your

protection.

The Lieutenant laughs.

LIEUTENANT

I think we can handle one little

girl.

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the

hotel.

LIEUTENANT

I sent two units. They're

bringing her down now.

AGENT SMITH

No, Lieutenant, your men are

already dead.

4 INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL 4

The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding

a bead. They've done this a hundred times, they know

they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuffs

and Trinity moves --

It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly

fast.

The eye blinks and Trinity's palm snaps up and the nose

explodes, blood erupting. Her leg kicks with the force

of a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-fifty

pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop

farthest from her.

Trinity moves again, BULLETS RAKING the walls,

flashlights sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try

to stop a leather-clad ghost.

A GUN still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted, and

FIRED. There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE and

when it's over, Trinity is the only one standing.

A flashlight rocks slowly to a stop.

TRINITY

Shit.

5 EXT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL 5

Agent Brown enters the hotel while Agent Smith heads for

the alley.

6 INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL 6

Trinity is on the phone, pacing. The other end is

answered.

MAN (V.O.)

Operator.

TRINITY

Morpheus! The line was traced! I

don't know how.

 MORPHEUS (MANV.O.)

I know. They cut the hardline.

This line is not a viable exit.

TRINITY

Are there any Agents?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Yes.

TRINITY

Goddamnit!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

You have to focus. There is a

phone. Wells and Lake. You can

make it.

She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

TRINITY

All right --

MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Go.

She drops the phone.
