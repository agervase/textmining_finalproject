as I walked into the light, I wandered into a white void surrounded by mist. I felt heat inside me and well aware of where I am. Familiar but unrecognizable. I feel like I have questions but only I have the answers too. "Why did this happen?" I knew why and it rushed to me. as I walked into the haze I look into the distance. I see two boys one with blonde hair and one with black hair. 

*"wow that was a good game! you won this round but im sure if im god and you were the devil I would win"* The boy with the black hair said. The blonde hair boy looked at him with a smile and said

*"I dont want to be the devil, I like creating, I like helping people out and maybe I can find a way for you not to corrupt them"* 

The black haired boy looked angry and he stood up from game table.

*"Thats not fair! you said I could be god next time! I want to make humans and my own animals. You did it wrong! you wanted to make them immortal? thats stupid, time would be useless if you lived forever. You wanted people to live without struggle? they wouldn't appreciate what they have if they didn't! I want to be god...I can be better."* 

I remembered who these boys are. They are my sons, I remembered why I went into the game..to settle the dispute of how the game was played. Only to realize that this wasn't a game, its a tool to create, to be selfless and make something beautiful. I walked to my sons Jehov, and Lucille

*"that is the point of this son, you see this isn't a game..you are supposed to work together to build a life. To give things what we are lucky to have. We create, but we also destroy. There can be no improvement without failure. Lucille, you are a good devil because you make people appreciate things before its gone, you give hardship and struggle. And Jehov you are a great god because you are so delicate and intricate with everyone. Everyone has a mission to complete and its up to them to complete it. but playtime is over boys, come with me its time for supper."*
