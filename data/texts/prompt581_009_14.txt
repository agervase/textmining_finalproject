--**Classified**: Abyssal-2 Clearance or higher required--

**Item ID**: 001-4

**Safety protocol**: Type 4; non-interactive, highly-reactive, non-hostile, cognizance-manipulator

As per Type 4 standards, this item is not to be used without express permission from Deep Council. It is to be stored at the center point of a circular security locker with a floor diameter of at least 20 meters in facility -/*classified*/- with other inanimate objects with low interaction ratings. Other items may be stored with this item. Three security guards of rank Abyssal-2 or higher are to be assigned to this item at all times. 

***SAFETY UPDATE***: As of incident 001-4G (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher), Security assigned to this item, and other items in proximity to this one, are to be fitted with active azurite halos as a precaution against mid level cognizance-manipulators and to improve response time. These guards are to be rotated out at two-hour intervals, due to the mental stress caused by wearing azurite halos.

Persons affected by 001-4-1 (see activation notes for more detail) are to be treated as hostile and lethal force is authorized in containing them. When the item is in its "activated" state facility -/*classified*/- is to be treated as an active Monsoon class event, and any persons not following Monsoon protocol are to be treated as casualties of 001-4-1. No person has yet recovered from 001-4-1, despite extensive therapy, cognizance-reformation, and memory-alteration, and once affected these persons become a danger to themselves at others. To reiterate, lethal force is authorized and encouraged to prevent the spread of casualties, and to reduce the suffering of those under the effects of 001-4-1.

**Interaction limits**: As per Type 4 standards, this item is not to be touched, approached, or looked except in emergency situations. Even in emergency situations, no staff with a rank below Abyssal-1 is to interact with this item. Personnel not wearing an azurite halo or stronger cognizance protection are prohibited from interaction with this item. All testing or interaction with this item must be approved by at least two Deep Council members. 

**ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS**: This item is to be kept in its "off" state pending a vote with the full Deep Council present. Until a majority vote declares otherwise, this item is considered too dangerous to be used. In the event of a Dark-Rise scenario, personnel of clearance Abyssal-4 or higher may use this item as per -/*classified*/- guidelines.

**Description**: Item# 001-4 is a a vehicle matching the appearance of a Honda Avancier with the front end and wheel assembly removed. The interior matches the make and model as well, with two exceptions. The steering wheel has been replaced with a set of three joystick controllers, each with a button on the top and four on the side, corresponding with the finger positions of a left-handed grip; and the dash display has been replaced with a dot-matrix screen from an Iron Maiden pinball machine. 

This item stays in its "off" state except when a human is seated in the driver's seat, and turns the ignition from "lock" to "on". Attempting to turn the ignition from the passenger seat has no effect. Sitting in the driver seat when the ignition is set to "on" has no effect. The act of turning the ignition must be carried out by a person sitting specifically in the driver seat to set the item to its "on" state. 

Once "on" the dot matrix display will show the current -/*classified*/-, -/*classified*/-, year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and tenth of a second. The number will constantly update, and has been shown to account for time zone, daylight savings time, and -/*classified*/- effects. This leads us to believe the item at some level responds to -/*classified*/- effects, despite being non-interactive. 

Below the fist set of numbers is a second set that corresponds to the time the item was set to its "on" state. The second number can be controlled with the joystick furthest to the driver's left. The trigger corresponding to the pointer finger will move to the next temporal measurement, the middle finger trigger will move to the previous temporal measurement, the ring trigger will reset the number to zero, and the pinkie trigger will reset the number to the current time's value. Holding the pinkie trigger will result in a constant update. Pressing the joystick up or down will cause the selected value to increase or decrease respectively, and with a rate of change corresponding to pressure on the joystick. Pressing the thumb button on top of the leftmost stick will activate the device. See "Activation Notes" below for a full description of the firing sequence.

The second joy stick controls the passage of time inside the vehicle. This stick functions in the same way as the first, however there is no visible display for the use of this stick, and it is not recommended for use during testing after incident 001-4C. (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher.) The purpose of the thumb button on this stick is not known at this time.

The third stick's function is not known at this time. Testing of this stick's function is prohibited after incident 001-4B. (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher.). Due to the hazardous nature of -/*classified*/- resulting from incident 001-4B, and the resulting damage to facility -/*classified*/-, further testing of this joystick must pass a majority vote from Deep Council. 

**Activation Notes**: When the thumb button on the leftmost joystick is pressed, this item turns from the "on" state to the "active" state. This state lasts approximately 30 seconds. 

During the first five (5) seconds of activation, the skin of all persons in the item appears to melt. Anyone looking at the item during this time will be unable to look away for the remainder of the process, and are to be considered casualties of 001-4's cognizance-manipulating effects, hereafter referred to as 001-4-1. 

During the next fifteen (15) seconds, the remainder of the bodies inside of the item will appear to catch fire and burn completely away. Anyone affected by  001-4-1 will hear the anguished cries of those inside the item, and will feel responsible for their perceived suffering. Anyone who looks at the item, and anyone who looks at a person under the effects of 001-4-1 at this time will also come under the effects of 001-4-1. ***SEE REVISION*** This has the potential to set off a chain-reaction, as seen in incident 001-4D (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher). 

During the last ten (10) seconds of activation the item will seem to fade from existence, and attempts to interact with it at this time support the theory that the item becomes incorporeal during this time. During this time, anyone who makes physical contact with someone suffering the effects of 001-4-1 will also come under its effects as seen in incident 001-4D, ***SEE REVISION*** though it has been noted that the visual effects of 001-4-1 are no longer in effect at this point. After the sequence is complete the item will have completely vanished. 

Persons affected by 001-4-1 will display rapidly escalating signs of remorse, paranoia, depression, and self-loathing. Approximately 65% of those affected will attempt suicide within ninety (90) minutes of becoming afflicted. Approximately 20% will become despondent, laying on the ground and refusing to move until they expire from sleep deprivation or dehydration. Persons put on life support will eventually regain the will to move, but will only use it to attempt suicide or to attack those around them. The remaining 15% will become increasingly violent until they are killed, or kill themselves. 

***REVISION***: As of incident 001-4G (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher), Azurite halos have been proven as sufficient protection against the second and third stages of this item's activation sequence. As of yet, no protective gear has been positively tested against the first part of the sequence. The added benefit of enhanced mental and physical response speeds have proven azurite halos to be invaluable in preventing the spread of 001-4-1 during its contagious state, and are to be worn by guards assigned to this item.

To date, no person has recovered from the effects of 001-4-1. Even when shown that the person(s) they believe they killed are in full health they refuse to accept it as reality, and continue their self-destructive actions.

Current test results all support the theory that the item sends itself and all its occupants unharmed to the second time listed on the dot-matrix display. The item will arrive in the same location relative to the latitude and longitudinal coordinates it left from. Objects and creatures placed in that location will be moved out of the way, and will be unharmed and unfazed by this movement as seen in incident 001-4A (Test log details are available to personnel ranked Abyssal-4 or higher). Structures erected in that location will either be moved, or "rebuilt" (see incident 001-4A) in a structurally safe way to allow the item's return.
