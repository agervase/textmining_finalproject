So, dad, where do babies come from?

Well, son, a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and they motion back and forth for a bit until they are tired.

After the great release of pent up energy occurs, they both lie there for a moment gasping for air wondering about all sorts of things that have nothing to do with children, or perhaps they have everything to do with children...either way, emotions and thoughts swirl around for a while as the dopamine kicks in and relaxation starts to settle their nerves and adrenaline back to a normal rhythm.

If they were not using some form of contraceptive, and both of them have reproductive organs capable of producing the necessary cells, then the sperm swim up into the uterus and eventually find an egg.  One sperm enters the egg and creates an embryo that attaches to the wall of the woman's uterus, where the child develops for the next roughly 9 months.

That, son, is where babies come from.

Dad?

Yes, son?

I knew that stork story was bullshit...

Well, son, I was trying to think of a more elegant way to describe that process to you, instead of being so blunt; however, the world is typically more direct and blunt than people are willing to accept, so I suppose this lesson is really two lessons at once.

I think I get it, dad.

So, what is the other lesson, son?

The world is a fucked up place, and no one wants to hear about it.

Son, I am not sure I was prepared for you to be that succinct about it...but...basically, yes.

So, dad, what should I ask mom that she would never tell me the truth about?

I will give you $20 if you ask her how many speeding tickets she has.

Dad, that has to be worth more than $20.

Ok, $40, but you have to record it for that much...

Deal!
