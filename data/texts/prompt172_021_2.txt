I cracked the reigns, and eight bodies emerged from the inky black cave I called home.

They aligned them self with the red sleigh, obedient.

As they always did, the cockroaches hissed when the leash had to go on.

The sleighs paint, faded was an unworldly deep pink, the structural integrity of the sleigh questionable at best. But, where we’re going, we don’t need Architecture 1 class.

We need magic.

These humans are stuck like men in trenches, and it’s time to get them out.

As I flew, I noticed the few settlements that had gained momentum since last year.

There’s this nice new one called Tesmium but I’m pretty sure it’ll get overthrown or blitzed.

Argus’ New World is gaining steam, but only because they are murdering other factions.

Very naughty.

Just as I was finished assessing a small fishing village, I noticed the torture of some poor Cartil scavenger via execution.

I had to do something.

The leader, gas mask clad, held what seemed to be a knife of forged metal from cans and other miscellaneous objects. He saw my sleigh, but went on trying to keep his calculating demeanor intact.

The hatch opened, dropping the wrapped gift with a parachute. I stayed in earshot to here what he said.

He grabbed the gift. “Well, what do ya know? I guess I’ll open my present. I’d love, just love for my gift to be the last thing you saw.” The leader bellowed maliciously. 

He took of the green and white paper to reveal a dumpy cardboard box.

Slicing it, he saw his gift,

the last thing he would see.

The package lit up a vibrantly warm mix of orange and yellow, destroying the victim, the leader, and his two cronies in a ball of flame and heat.

These humans destroyed the planet and didn’t even ask how I wanted it. You salute to Claus or you salute the Grim Reaper.

I do not rule opposed. If any try and challenge me, well...

Christmas comes early for them.
