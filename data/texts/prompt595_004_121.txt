I saw scores of men fall in the surge... 

To xenomorphs and doggo-aliens that had merged.

I saw the tides of battle wane

I saw our leaders, galore, fall into the hands of their leader

I saw our efforts go in vane 

I saw them treat us like a mobile feeder

We danced and screamed like a chew toy

Until the only one on the streets was a punk boy

Crying out to fight, these hellistic demons galore

And when his voice was still

We all gathered and bore

A similar mark til'

The end of time we shared

This mark of which we bared

It's called being "redditors"

we certainly aren't "predators"

But by God we'd win the fight

and we would make them run

into that dark starry night

With our mind guns


Larry was a furry

And Jane was a writer

Maxim's job was blurry

but we think he was a keyboard fighter

James was a bonds man

And Carlos had /nosleep

Mishka was a Russian fan

Ron liked going shoulder deep


Somehow this band

of brothers and girl

Would stop a fight that spanned

from galaxies to Belgium 

and Jane could hurl

a grenade into an engine

using her trebuchet.


Boom went the ship

Floating down from space

Janes hand went to her hip

and said "There goes a race"

Maxim sat there laughing

And Carlos said with glee

"I'm going to go on slashing

up a story about...me!"

Mishka fought a bear,

And james just said goodbye

"With a head of hair,

I bet that I can lie.

The name is bond,"

he said, and off he went

We weren't too fond,

of that man and how he spent

His time, his money, hell, his life.

But then came Larry,

and James wasn't actually that bad anymore.
