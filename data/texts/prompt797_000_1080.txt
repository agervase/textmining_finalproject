***Abstract***: In this report, the authors investigate the Gaia\-Earthite sentience. The authors posit this mind to be a hivemind, with multiple personalities manifesting at the fore, each a distinct individual. This myriadalistic phenomenology is all the more interesting as it manifests itself within the structure of a Bicameral duality.

# Introduction

The Hivemind of the Gaia\-Earthites was first discovered by Mist\-Whose\-Luminence\-Abounds during an expedition to install a Dyson Router near Alpha Centauri. The sentience was first thought to be a Solitary, with social structures driven by various dogmas. However, upon closer inspection by the authors of this report, it was found that this sentience displayed many of the characteristics of a Hivemind *as well as* those of a Solitary.

The Sentience was deemed dangerous and was thus confined to its current location; Earth, chosen for its proximity to the Sentience’s origin system and for logistical convenience. The Dyson Router on Alpha Centauri, which has since been completed, provides an added layer of security against any violence that may be perpetuated by the Sentience, thus providing a safe seat for observation.

Following discussions between the authors of this work and several experts in the field of Cognitive Sentience, funding was granted by the *Centre for the Study of Sentience, Intelligence and Intellectual Autonomy* on Enfeen to investigate this curiosity in greater detail for the period of one Throk \(roughly equivalent to one thousand standard orbital periods of the Gaia\-Earthite planet around it’s sun\).

This resulted in the authors being able to observe several generations of Gaia\-Earthite life, and has directly led to the conclusions to be found in this report.

# Discussion

The Gaia\-Earthite sentience is, first and foremost, a Bicameral one. The Speaker, Gaia, manifests its personality through its Obeisant, the Earthite. However, the uniqueness of Gaia\-Earthite is that the Speaker, Gaia, displays several symptoms of Dissociative Identity Disorder \(DID\) and acts out these symptoms via its Obeisant.

Due to the DID of the Speaker, the Obeisant take various forms. Among the most Intelligent and Intellectually Autonomous \(Int, IntA\) forms are two instances of mammal: Humans and Dolphins, along with several instances of Cephalopods \(e.g Octopi and Cuttlefish etc\) and Fungi \(e.g. Trichoderma etc\).

Due to the limited temporal resource available to the authors, it was decided to spend the majority of their time in observation of the Human instance, as it developed the most during the observation and displayed the most intriguing behaviour. The DID of the Gaia consciousness manifests itself within the Human instance as a Solitary species and sentience. However, despite this, the separation between the Gaia consciousness and the Human Instance \(HI\) isn’t complete, as evidenced by the many social behaviours exhibited by this Obeisant.

The Gaia consciousness \(GC\) acts out it’s DID on the HI in a shocking display of myriadality; each HI is a Solitary sentience *as well as* being biologically unique and distinct from the others. By the time the authors observational period had ended, there were nearly Ecta Sevl HI’s, with several Meel\-Sevl having existed before.

The HI appears to adopt several of the GC’s traits upon congregating into social groups. The instances display collectivism, albeit usually acting out the destructive fantasies of the Speaker. The instances refer to this as “mob mentality”. Ironically, the Speaker shields itself from being re\-assimilated by the HI collectivism by entering into a child\-like state. The “mob” acts in ways that suggest it is far less intellectually capable than the sum of its parts, being more emotionally susceptible, impressionable and reactive.

However, this simple affine connection between the Speaker and the Obeisant does not inhibit the Obeisant from carrying out the depraved, twisted fantasies of the Speaker on other instances of itself, much less on other instances of the Obeisant. While some, if not most, instances display behaviour towards the others that can be considered caring or considerate \(or at worst, apathetic\), some instances commit acts upon the others that can only be described as gratuitously violent. Some instances even do so upon being mandated to commit such actions by others of their own instance, despite lacking the psychological inclination to participate in such behaviour of their own free will. The dogmas that govern their society contribute to legitimising this violence, while desensitizing those who lack the appetite for destruction or violence.

However, the myriad Obeisant displays a dichotomous nature in their ability to perpetuate kindness with the same ferocity as they wage war against themselves. It appears that while the GC\-Speaker suffers from DID, it also suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \(OCD\) to a lesser degree, thus working to balance the actions of its Obeisant.

## Conclusion

While the uniqueness of the Gaia\-Earthite Hivemind is beyond question, the conclusions reached by the observers of said Hivemind about its development and purpose are not unanimous.

It is the conclusion of one author that the Hivemind may not suffer from DID at all, but instead be acting out the juvenile fantasies of the Speaker’s Ego through the violence of the Obeisant. It is believed by this author that the Hivemind generated this instance of the Obeisant to fulfil its self\-destructive tendencies. The author proposes that this instance will realise this behaviour to its completion and inevitable extinction, at which point, the author hopes the Hivemind will have outgrown its juvenile, destructive tendencies.

The other remaining authors find the diagnosis of DID and OCD in the GC\-Speaker to be convincing, as several behaviours displayed by the Obeisant seem to suggest this is the case. For example, some of the recent technological activity by the Obeisant was aimed at discovering similar life forms in their sector. While these efforts are doomed to fail due to the unique nature of their existence, meaning they will not find sentience quite like their own or be able to recognise it when discovered, this search appears to mirror a deep\-seated desire to confirm they are not alone. It is thus regrettable that the Obeisant do not expend any effort closer to themselves, as uncovering the truth of their sentience may expedite the Gaia\-Earthite Hivemind’s recovery from DID while at the same time initiating the maturation of the Human Instance into an Obeisant that is not a slave to the Ego of the Speaker.

The authors have arrived at various interpretations of the observations made of the Gaia\-Earthite Hivemind, but one thing can be agreed upon by all; the Sentience in question is a treasure\-trove of knowledge and further research is not only advised, but incumbent upon us as Keepers of Sentience.
