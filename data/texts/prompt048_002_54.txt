*Ah fuck.*

Lying there on my desk was an envelope. Vanilla, inconspicuous looking, flap slightly open. The person who'd done it hadn't bothered to lick the little adhesive or whatever to lick it. I knew I wasn't the only one who hated those. 

But I knew, *knew* like I knew the sky was blue what I would find inside there. Trembling, I lifted the flap and peered inside. 

Cash. 

I went to take the bills out, but I dropped the envelope on the floor, and the bills spilled on the floor. A dozen Benjamins stared at me, their eyes somehow accusing. 

"Satisfied?"

I whirled around, expecting to find someone there, but there's no one - just my trashy one-room apartment. 

"In your head, dolt. Jesus Christ, mate, you'd think you would've gotten used to it by now."

I didn't need to speak to it, or even think in sentences to it. As soon as a thought formed, it knew. 

"None of your damn business how I got it, mate," the voice said again. "You got your money, yeah? Stay happy." 

Thinking again. 

This time the voice laughs - it is a grating noise inside my ears, hostile, unnatural. "Who did I possess? Are you kiddin' me right now, mate?"

My heart started beating louder. 

I put on some flip flops and practically ran out of the apartment. I took the elevator to the bottom of the building, and nodded to Carl, the security guard. 

"Carl," I said in the way way of greeting. 

Carl waved his donut at me. 

"Did someone enter the building after me?" I asked. 

Carl frowned but shook his head. "Nah, man. You came in from your night shift as usual, then you left again in the middle of the damn night, and then you came back like two hours ago. No one else came in or out." He blew air out of his nose. "You got a weird schedule man."

It took all my self control to smile back, and slowly, deliberately, step back in the elevator, with that same mocking laugh bouncing around in my head as I did.
