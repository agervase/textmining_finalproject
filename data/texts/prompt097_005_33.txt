Lushaika woke up to the scent of a pheromone package pumped in through the ships air vents, one spiced with uncertainty and concern. Unwinding her eight segmented body from her sleep perch she blearily groomed her antenna with one of her four three fingered grasping limbs and rotated her mandibles before slowly trudging out of the sleeping quarters. As the doors slid open the slightest hiss of the hydraulics woke 1 of 6720 and 500 of 588 who glanced up from their own sleeping perches.

*Mate?* They scent sang hopefully, their juvenile blue chitin that still didn’t quite sit right on their bodies rattling as the struggled to unwind without their many limbs entangling. It was probably a good thing, Lushaika mused, that the razor-sharp fighting limbs that rested under their grasping limbs were still juvenile soft, otherwise they’d have cut themselves to pieces already.

*No*. Lushaika sang back firmly, *No mate. Sleep until called.*

Mandibles clacking in disappointment the two juveniles rewound themselves around their perches. Lushaika hissed as she watched them with frustration and scuttled out of the sleep chamber. She understood the logic of sending juveniles out on expedition like this, but that didn’t mean she liked it. Unlike other races the *Kalis* were not inherently sentient, that capability only developed when environmental pressures required great unity and intelligence within the hive. Given that like most space faring species the *Kalis* had conquered their environment centuries before new kinds of pressure had been need. A two yearlong expedition to a First Spawned relic site was, in the eyes of Council of Uplifting, an excellent chance to expose a group of promising juveniles to some good developmental pressures. Especially if Lushaika could somehow work some extra stress into the trip

*An excellent idea, unless you count the fact except* *all the pressure seems to be on me.* Lushaika sang to herself in disgust. The Council of Uplifting was infamously incompetent, but this scheme of theirs was a new low. How they expected Lushaika to ‘add’ stress to a trip that was already boarding on nightmarish was beyond her. Taking care of four juveniles was a challenge to begin with, four juveniles on a ship with one adult while trying to study a notoriously dangerous First Spawned site felt more akin to a suicide attempt. And as for the juveniles themselves, well frankly Lushaika wasn’t sure what exactly made them look so promising in the council’s eyes.

1 and 500 were distinctly disappointing. Good for menial labour, mating, and not much else. The other two juveniles, 2 of 6, the only surviving member of a disastrous clutch, and 85 of 400 had at least a bit of promise. But not to the extent that Lushaika would be presenting them at a naming ceremony anytime soon. The only adult on the ship, Lushaika felt more like a clutch keeper tending to the stupidest brood in the hive then an archeologist. It didn’t help she was getting close to molting. At eight segments long Lushaika was already large for her race, but she could feel the uncomfortable pressure under her chitin that warned her that soon she’d have to shed to make way for a ninth.

*And that will be so very fun*, she sang, her scent bitter and sharp, *A full cycle without supervision, they’ll have reduced the ship to scrap metal by the time I’m done molting.*

With a deep hum of disgust Lushaika sprayed the air with a cleansing scent to hide her rant and stepped onto the bridge. 2 and 85 were waiting for her, all three of their segments low to the ground with their limbs splayed out in a sign of submission and fear.

A chorus of scent songs filled the air with apologies until Lushaika was forced to spray cleanser just to make herself heard, *Quiet, no scent! Show me problem.*

The two juveniles scuttled over to a console, still so low to the ground that they were using their grasping limbs like climbing limbs as they ran. Lushaika followed trying to hold back her scent of annoyance. 2 pointed at a reading on the console, *No scent song relic sang. Electric thought offers no scent of reason.*

Lushaika blinked, six eyes moving in unison, and peered down to confirm the juvenile’s garbled report. It was something of an artform understanding a developing juvenile. Grammar was something of a mystery to them and they tended to forget the proper terms for things. But if 2 was right something interesting had just happened.

Very interesting.
