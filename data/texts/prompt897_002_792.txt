"Merry Christmas!"

George flipped through his character sheet a few times as the DM handed out gifts.

"Now, we don't have long for today's session, do you guys think we should just hand out gifts and get back to-"

George flicked his gaze across his party, a grin settling on his face. "Say, it's also Christmas in game, right?"

"...Yes?" The Dm asked.

"George, no," Thomas said, straightening up. Half of a box of chocolates was already in his mouth.

"And that means that our enemies are also celebrating Christmas, yes?" George said, plucking up the dice.

"George, no, I have a family to get back to, I can't spend the entire day rolling dice on a surprise attack," Thomas whined.

The Dm took a long drawn out sigh. "Look, it's raining, and there's a river in your way. Open your present and leave, George."

George looked over the other two sitting at the table. "No, I am sick and tired of morale being low and getting our asses kicked by the empire!"

"Maaaaaayyyybbbeeee," The Dm drawled. "You shouldn't've taken a swing at the greatest empire in the world? I had a fantastic story set to the side about the natives."

"No, he's right," John said.

"John why are you betraying me like this?" The Dm asked, mournfully.

"I'm a spy," John explained. "And that means..." John slapped the dice on the table.

The Dm stared down at the events with rising horror. "It means you know that they bought your story,  hook line and sinker... and don't think you'll attack Trenton."

George stood up, downed the rest of his coffee, and posed, pointing at the DM. "Then there's only one thing left to do! Let's CROSS THE DELAWARE!"

A long, defeated sigh from the DM. "...roll the dice."
