"You're not allowed to die, okay? Promise to me that you will never go out and let yourself die." She says holding a warm glow of light to my chest as I lay on the ground severely injured. I nodded a bit as she continued tears streaming down her face. She soon finishes and shimmers evaporating into the air around me. I sit up fully healed but my armor in tatters. My silver sword I use for killing monsters wasn't in much better condition, but the steel sword I have is in better shape. I get up and head over to the next town to fix my things.

It's been 200 years since that promise and I have kept it every single day. I have seen all of my other comrades come and go. I live in the small town of Vizima where a new witch has came in. One day I came up to her to ask her about what happened 200 years ago.

"She healed your wounds?" She asks in which I nod in response, "And then she evaporated into the air." I nod again, "And this happened 200 years ago?" I nod once more

She goes to her bookshelf and fingers though her books pulling out a small journal with a few pages. She skims though it and nods going to her potion brewing station and whipping up a potion.

She hands it to me and says, "Drink if you'd like to see that witch again." 

Without hesitation I took it and drank the potion. It immediatly took effect and it felt like the breath and even the very blood in my body was being siphoned out. After a bit a figure appears in front of me taking form of the woman who saved my life so many years ago. She looked at the witch, who she was facing, then me and ran over hugging me around the neck.

"You kept your promise witcher. I thank you so much for it."
