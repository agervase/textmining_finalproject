Two names. Everyone has them on their skin, from birth. One is the love of your life, the other is the name of someone who will kill you. People have tried to implement laws to protect people from their future killers, but that fell apart quickly. It isn’t uncommon for people to flinch when you are introduced to them. 

This is just how life is. It is hard not looking over shoulder, trying to make sure you will live until tomorrow. If only last names were there too, but you only have a first name to go off of. Sadly, I have it harder than most. I have two names like everyone else, but they are the same name. Sarah. As a child, I was determined to stay away from anyone named Sarah, I didn’t want to die, and how important was love? In college, I came across a girl named Alex. We clicked. I thought I had cheated the system since there was only Sarah on my skin, but my name was on her’s. I was born Roger Clemons. The only other name was Ron. 

A few months in, she revealed to me her real name was Sarah, but she hated it, and went by her middle name.  We were so in love, I tossed my childhood rule out of the window. After college, we got married, and I have to say, I was never happier. We had a daughter, who we named Samantha. Her names were Ronald and Armando. I couldn’t help wonder who would be who. But life went on. 

Unfortunately, as I am writing this in the last few minutes of my life, so someone knows how unfair life can be, I now know why the same name was on my skin twice. The woman I loved so much, is also the death of me. She died yesterday in a car accident, our little girl also didn’t make it. I cannot bear to live without her. 

I’ll end it here, I can already feel the drowsiness taking over from the pills I took. I cannot say I’m scared. In case you were wondering, the man who hit them was named Ronald, Ron for short, the name on my wife’s left foot, and my little angel’s center back.
