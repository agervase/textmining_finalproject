The worm old woman had pink plastic curlers in her hair. She was wearing what was once a light and airy housecoat now faded with age and repeated washings. The color ran like and oil painting in the rain.  
She was obviously out of breath but kept slowly bringing the rake down against the car. 
As a passing cars headlights lit up the door you are standing in she sees you for the first time.
"Well what do think you're doing, you fairy?" She says breathlessly.
You are surprised at the vehemence the old lady exudes.
Also wonder were she gets off calling you a fairy. 
You answer her. "I'm making a writing prompt for reddit."
"Oh Red-dit how la-de-da." She mocks. she is starting to get to you. 
"It's very interesting I set up a writing prompt. You know I suggest an idea and they write about it. It can be very interesting." 
"Is that on that internet? It ain't healthy. You look like some sunlight could kill you. It all sounds daft to me." She responds. Shaking her head back and forth. 
.
Now you are a little pissed off. 
"Look you... Look lady at least I'm not outside hitting a car at two in the morning. I should also tell you that's my car you're hitting. What are you crazy?"
.
"Oh it's two in the morning? Oh I'm sorry." She seemed to be softening. 
"It the fucking cat.  Stupid animal doesn't know what is good for it. It's in your car. It ran up the wheel well and is now in the bonnet. I think the dumb animal likes the heat." 
.
You think for a second, just a second of starting the car just to see her reaction.
You instead pop the hood. She gratefully takes her skittish cat out of the engine compartment. 
"I'm sorry. Thanks." 
You nod your head.
"Goodnight," you say. 
 As she turns and walks she says one last thing. 
In a very soft voice she says. 
"You're very nice, for an old Fairy."
