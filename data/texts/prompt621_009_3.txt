Rob sat at his chair, gazing at the screen. Just another day of playing No Man's Sky, exploring the vast galaxies. Chips were scattered across the Oriental carpet, also stained by booze and soda. He was just having a fun time, but what he didn't know, was that 500 miles away, in a secret military base, a general was looking at his Steam account. 

*Somewhere, in Nevada*

"What the-" General Waller said. 

He rubbed his eyes. Maybe the countless hours searching for a player had gotten to him. 

"Chang! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?" 

The general slowly raised his head from his desk, then stumbled over drunkenly to his fellow general. His eyes widened as he read the time on the screen. In an instant, the general went from semi-hangover to energetic. He did a celebration dance, but General Waller stopped him. 

"We have to confirm this."

Rob was looking at his screen, all relaxed, when suddenly, there was a stinging pain, then the world went black. He later woke up in a empty room, with a light hanging over his head, like in horror movies. A figure approached from the darkness, and Rob  fainted. The last words he heard were, "God dammit, Rob!"

Rob woke up yet again, but this time in a well conditioned room. The room was illuminated with light this time, and the was a working air conditioner. General Waller approached Rob.

"We saw that you have 42 hours put into the game No Man's Sky. Is this true?"

Rob was confused. "Wha.. Wha.. Uhh.."

"Well, I guess I should introduce myself. My name is General Waller, part of the U.S. Armed Forces. No Man's Sky was a test made by our scientists to determine who was capable of enduring extended periods of boredom before succumbing to insanity. You have put the most time into the game, an astounding *42 hours* straight. Our test results show you are capable of surviving 20 years of boredom, double the amount of time needed to make the trip to another galaxy."

Rob took a long time to understand what the general was saying. After a long silence, he said, "Uhh.. ok?"

General Waller's eyes brightened, and he exclaimed, "Great! You will be leaving in roughly 2 hours."

"Wait, what about my friends and family? Don't I get to say goodbye?"

"Nah, too heartbreaking. Besides, you barely interacted with them. Oh, and there is another partner going along with you."

"Who is it?"

A smile spread across his face. "You'll see."

Well, I'm ending it on a cliffhanger. I'm only 11, so there might be problems.
Criticism is welcome!


Might do a part 2 later.
