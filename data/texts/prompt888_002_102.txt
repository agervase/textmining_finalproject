I logged into my account, seeing what others had posted on my thoughts on how a sandwich was just like my life. 

WHOA! It seemed my post had blown up over night. It had been upvoted 3412 times and had more than two hundred responses. I opened the link and started reading on what people had to say.

Ummm.... Wow! That seemed like a lot of text. I guess that many upvotes meant it had to be. I scrolled down, hoping there would be some more bite-sized info that I could comment on for that karma. It had been ten hours already since I posted so I wasn’t that hopeful.

I kept scrolling till I reached the end. Every freaking POST! It seemed like people were writing novels now. Had something changed while I was asleep? It seemed like I was in r/bathtubthoughts instead of r/showerthoughts. I sighed! Might as well read at least some of them. 

I scrolled up again, to the top post and started reading, being sure that the comment had to be either really insightful or really trashy to be given three golds. 

I had read about half of the text, and it still wasn’t making any sense. Who were these characters talking about a bolognese? Along with inter-galactic travel and a machine that reminded me of Star Trek’s replicator. I continued,  hoping for some rhyme or reason in the post, but really didn’t understand it. What relevance had this to a life being like a sandwich. It almost seemed like a story? I clicked to make the full thread for this visible, and again was wondering if I had too much to smoke last night. This was insightful??? 

I hoped that the next comment would be better, but it was just as bad. I just gave up now. My life was a mess, just like my sandwich. I switched off the my laptop, picked up a towel and went into the bathroom, hoping to drown myself in the bathtub. No more showers for me.

Great! Now I was making punchlines in my thought process. Sigh! 2meta4me.
