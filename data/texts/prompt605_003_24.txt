Bzzzt ... bzzzt

My phone lit up, it was an unknown number. I look up to my window, not seeing the faint gleam of a tiny camera in the upper right corner of the pane. They're probably looking for me now. I know too much, the world isn't as we think it is, there's so much more out there to see. 

My finger hovers over the screen, twitching with anxiety. This wasn't my fault, they'll probably listen right? If they called this fast, then that means that they know it was just an accident. That means I'll get away scott free. 
Oh who am I kidding, if they've covered this up this well, they'll want me silent. Carrot and the stick, probably the stick first with the promise of safety afterwards. God I hope they won't go after my sister.

The phone turns dark as the call drops. I look outside, the clouds are dark, heavy with rain. At least that's what my left eye saw, the one without my contacts. My right eye saw the regular plethora of colors I'd seen for most of my life. Life without the filter seemed so bleak.

There it goes again, they're probably not gonna stop. At least I can listen to what they're getting me before I make a break for it. 

"Hello?"

"Good evening Chad. This is Char Bradley?"

"Yes?"

"Oh good, I thought I had the wrong number. This is customer service, I heard you broke your contacts. Not to worry, if you send it through the box that will arrive in 26.4 seconds. We'll make sure there'll be nothing to worry about."

"This is a joke right?"

"Oh no sir, we take customer service very seriously. Nothing brings me more joy than to know another Disney customer is happy. Have a magical day!"
