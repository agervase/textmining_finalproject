"I never really get what I want.", said Carol.

"What do you mean?", said Fred.  They were perched on the low stone wall that encircled the campus.

"You know that guy Jack from the college radio station?"

"Yeah, the guy who always wears one punk band t-shirt after another?"

"Yeah.  He's so cute.  I'm super into him, but he said no."  Tears bloomed in her eyes.

"What did he say no to?" 

"To me!  What did you think I was talking about?"

"I don't understand.  Did you ask him a weirdly phrased question?  Did he misunderstand you?"

"Asshole.  I asked him out.  He said 'no thanks' and kept on moving.  I know it's stupid, but I kinda feel crumpled up."

"I don't think it's stupid.  Is he gay?  Is he already dating someone?"

"Neither.  I know.  I asked Kathy."  It was true.  Kathy was like a database of people and gossip. "Haven't you ever been rejected?"

"Ummm, no.  I've gone out with every girl I've ever asked.  Then when I want a different girl or a break,  I tell her we're over and we both move on.  It's like, you know, when you want something, you get it."
"God, Freddie, you're either the luckiest guy who ever lived or a spoiled dick."

"Hey!  I'm not spoiled.  Spoiled is when you want too much stuff that's not good for you."

"It really isn't.  Spoiled is when you always get your way.  When is the last thing you wanted that you couldn't have?"

Fred thought about it.  He turned the question in his mind.  It didn't make sense.
"I don't know."

"Well, what do you want now?"

"I want lunch.  I could go for a cheeseburger and fries.  Do you want to grab some lunch?"

"What if I say no?  Would that collapse your whole worldview?"

"No, I'd probably just figure you ate earlier."

"Excuse me?"  A girl on a bike slowed to a stop in front of them.  She looked like a more beautiful and more pneumatic version of a model.  She took off her backpack and pulled out a Gruntburger bag. "Do you guys want some cheeseburgers and fries?  They gave me two extra meals in my bag for no reason.  Then they wouldn't take them back!  Isn't that crazy?"  Fred held out his hand.

"Thanks.  What's your name?"

The girl blushed and smiled.
"It's Candice."

"Thanks, Candice!  I'm Fred.  What are you doing tonight?"

"Nothing.  Why, wanna go out?"

"Sure.  Why not meet me at Coo Coo's Coffee at 7?"

"Okay!  I'll see you then."  She got back on her bike, secured her backpack and rode off.
"Hey Carol, you want a cheeseburger? And fries?"  He grinned.

"Yeah, sure."  She took the bag from him and started to eat.

"You see?  I'm not spoiled, Carol.  In fact, I like to share things.  You're my friend!  I want you to get whatever you want, too!"

"Thanks, Fred.  That's nice.  I wish we had some cokes."  A man walking by with a shopping bag stopped, turned, and reached into his bag to pull out two bottles of coke.  He handed them to Carol, then walked away without a word.

"Whoah, Fred did you see that?"  But Fred was busy accepting an iced tea bottle from another hot girl.

"I like iced tea.  Thanks!"
