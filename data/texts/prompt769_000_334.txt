Rewind.

"I really do love him, and I need him to know that. He's the only man I could ever desire, and he is the most beautiful soul I have ever met. I deeply and truly love him and always will."

Jason rewound the tape again, adjusting on the ratty couch. Comfort was likely not a concern of whoever furnished this tiny eternal apartment, and it showed. Red walls on all side, and only two items in the sealed room: the sofa and the television. There was no need to sleep, or eat, or use the restroom. Just watch, forever, uninterrupted. The tapes played every moment of Jason's life...only, not just through his eyes. He heard the words of everyone who he affected, everyone he touched in life. All of them, here on this tape, waiting for him to finish the episode he was so currently wrapped up in. 

Rewind.

"I really do love him, and I need him to know that. He's the only man I could ever desire, and he is the most beautiful soul I have ever met. I deeply and truly love him and always will."

Jason looked up at the flat wall, noticing entirely too late that a door had appeared where there was never one. In stepped a familiar man in a pinstripe suit and fedora. 

"Hello, Jason." Satan grinned and took a seat. "How are you liking the show? Are the words of all those you feared the judgment of burning through your brain? You have every single moment of your life there, all on record and all being judged, and it's all true. Do you want to see my favorite clip?"

Jason held the remote like a talisman. "No, I don't. I've found the only clip that matters. Why don't you watch it with me? Watch how quickly your curse has fallen apart."

Rewind.

The screen turned again to the hospital bed, as a delirious Amelia took the hand of a hospice worker and struggled out her last words.

"I really do love him, and I need him to know that. He's the only man I could ever desire, and he is the most beautiful soul I have ever met. I deeply and truly love him and always will."

Jason put the remote down and turned to the Morningstar with a grin. "Do you see it now? No matter what I see on this screen, no matter how horribly I acted and no matter how horribly I was perceived, I've won. The only woman who ever mattered to me spent her last moments telling me she loved me. I can brave it all, demon."

Satan grinned, stifled a laugh and picked up the remote. "Perhaps you would like to see the rest of the clip?" The Devil pressed play, and the feed resumed. "I just wish I could tell Jason, and apologize for keeping our love a secret from him. I never wanted to hurt Jason, but I could never love him the way I love Chris."

Wordlessly, Lucifer closed Jason's hanging jaw and stood up, slowly walking to the door. "Enjoy the rest of the season. I assure you, it gets much worse. See you in a thousand years." With that, the door became smooth wall, and Jason was alone with his screams once more.
