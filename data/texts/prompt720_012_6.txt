The young woman stood at the weathered gravestone. Made of a rare trystium alloy, it was in the inimitable style of the Blenim artists of New Earth 79325038, a world the natives had once called ... well, never mind, she couldn’t pronounce it either.

The green sun overhead defied the optical laws of astronomy, which she thought appropriate for a paradise planet with only two living sentients on it.

Native life had reached for the stars but fell short, tragically felled by a pathogen of their own making. They had hoped that spraying their world with it would eradicate a plague bacterium that had disfigured the people for millennia. Instead, it caused rapid mutations  in the bacteria that terminated all macroscopic life but the vegetation.

In a sense the scientists succeeded. Without any animal life to sustain it, the plague bacterium became extinct.

But that was long ago. How long could be estimated by radioisotope dating of the gravestone that her archaeological robots had detected and then dug out of the alluvial strata: 63 million years.

Whether the plant life now abundant on the planet had much similarity to the vegetation known to the person memorialised by the stone, would take many decades longer to ascertain.

Such an interval was a blink of the eye to her, as the genetic defects that once made humans biologically mortal had been corrected before this world had yet seen primitive steel tools.

Still, after all the years of her life, comfortably numbering nine digits, this was an especially exciting day for her.

The sediments had been prepared well enough that tests proved they preserved enough of the DNA of the buried remains perfectly.

Her mother spoke gently to her: “Rachel, while the genomic synthesiser works, let’s you and I build a lake and then a homely house like the one where I lived as a child, on Logan Street.”
