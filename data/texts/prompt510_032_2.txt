She was still too pretty, even in this dim light. It was like she wasn't a real person, like a photo in a magazine.

"So.... you're death? How? Why?" I asked over the low murmur of the patrons and the soft music

"What, a personification of something most everyone fears can't enjoy a walk? What's the deal with you? Even people who end up attracted to me tend to keep to themselves." She replied a little defensively.

"Why's that?"
 
"Depressed. Suicidal."

"I'm not suicidal, maybe a bit apathetic, a dose of ennui perhaps."

"Then why am I beautiful to you?"

"I'm not sure I can explain it. I'm not afraid of death. I'm not that curious about it. But maybe I think there's something wonderful about an end to the perpetual struggle. I don't want to die, ah shit, I'm going to need a drink if I'm going to get this philosophical. You drink?" 

She nodded, "Whiskey sour, please."

I went up to the bar and grabbed her drink and a Crown Royal neat for me. Figured I'd need something strong for this.

"How can I put this? I think there's no point in sweating about death. And the end to the pain and struggle is something beautiful in itself. As someone who used to be such an awkward fuck, the thought that one day none of this will matter to anyone else is appealing, beautiful even. Doesn't mean I want to rush into dying, it still matters to me..."

She listened to all of this quietly, digested on it while sipping on her drink.

"I might feel a little bad coming for you. But it is said that things hurt less if you do them quickly... Maybe next Tuesday."

She finished her drink, got up and disappeared into the crowd. I stood there dumbfounded. She had to be kidding, right? I mean, we created the concept, death has to have a sense of humor.
