Woo! Once I created the telepathic winged octopus thing I knew I could come back to this save and do something with those bird-lizard things I made! All I needed was a seven day break. Now let me load it up and...What the fuck is this? What are these things?! Let alone the four legged furry things but out of all of them there these two pink freaks just kind of standing there. Well whatever once I find my lizards the improvements I'll make...oh they'll deal with those fuckers quickly....wait...where are they? Where the fuck are they?! Oh for fucks sake! You leave for a few days and this shit happens! Just leave AI I said. It'll be fine I said. Now I've completely screwed myself over. Well whatever I guess I'll deal with the pink things. You know after dealing with them for a couple of hours they're not quite bad I can see some potential for these things. I just need to make sure they don't mess with my new favorite tree. I'll just send them a quick message "hey you! Don't touch that tree!" Yeah that'll work. Now for some lunch. Now I'm back and I'm sure they're just sitting around doing nothing...Oh dammit all to hell! Why?! Why?! I told them specifically not to touch the damn tree!!!Now look what they've done! It's all a mess! There's more of them, they've started killing each other! Somehow one of the males has bred with three females and now each of them has a pantheon dedicated to me! How does that work?! Why are they fighting about it?! Somehow out of the two I saw originally they've managed to somehow change colors and spread like a disease. I don't even know how they got some of these places. Just to top it all off they're now ripping things out of the ground. That's not how it's supposed to work!!!! You know what fuck it. I'm getting a headache I'll just come back a little later to see what happens next. Most likely just kill themselves and save me the trouble.
