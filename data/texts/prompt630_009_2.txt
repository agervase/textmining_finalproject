It was a quiet night in the holdfast. Security team had just swept the neighborhood, and put a few lurchers in lock-up for chattel. Folk were feeling about as safe as they ever might, confident they'd lie in their own beds that night, and wake up sane and whole in the morning. It was a good night for a few drinks.

"OK OK OK, so it's passed on from biting, right?" Mike asked, leaning protectively over his glass, a mesh cap tugged sideways over his unruly gray hair.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, Mike, it's gotta be in the spit," said Oscar, idly fidgeting with a pen in hand. "Or the blood. We know a scratch won't turn you. Get you real sick, though. Lotta folks died from fever early on, but didn't get back up and walk around."

&#x200B;

Mike nodded with low understanding. "So if a lurcher spat in someone's face, they would turn, right?" Mike's gaze turned pointedly my way for a moment, and I sighed inward, already tired of where this conversation was going. Oscar, also drinking heavily, must have missed the significance of the glance.

&#x200B;

"Well that depends on where it hits. If it just lands on your cheek, probably not. If it got in your eyes, or your mouth, or into an open wound or something, you could turn from that." Oscar was one of our medics. Real humble guy. He liked to say that before the plague he was a Certified Ass-wiping CNA at Saint Joe's, which I guess is why he knew his shit so well. We tried not to hold it against him, and he tried not to hold it against us when he had to pull double-duty because we got shot up on patrol.

&#x200B;

"Then," Mike growled, looking to me again, "how come Booger over here didn't turn when he caught a mouthful of snot from that Hawker months ago?" There it was.

&#x200B;

I set down my glass with more force than I meant, but less than I felt. "Goddammit, Mike, we've been over this a dozen times." I looked him in the eye, trying to be more intimidating than I felt, "Don't fucking call me that. And it was just luck. I spat it out quick enough or something."

&#x200B;

Oscar gave me a thoughtful look from over his glass. "You know, it might not've been luck." He trailed off, draining his liquor, and pushing it across the bar for a refill. He had Mike's attention again, at least. "Maybe Jay's got a tolerance, or an immunity, or something." He saw me shaking my head, and hurried on, "No, come on, it's not that far fetched, I heard about a group out west of survivors who only take people who were bit and didn't turn."

&#x200B;

I opened my mouth to interject, but Mike managed to say it first. "Aw that's horseshit, Oscar. Nobody believes that shit."

&#x200B;

"Why not? Immunity happens all the time with all kinds of diseases, alright? Some animal has some kinda gene or antibody from somewhere else that keeps 'em from getting sick." We sat in silence for a moment, as Oscar, refilled drink in hand, took another long swig. "Used to be we'd take a person or an animal like that and study 'em, and make a vaccine. But nobody's got the tools for that anymore."

&#x200B;

"So assumin' that somebody with the antibots were real," began Mike.

"Antibodies," Oscar corrected.

"Antiwhogivesafucks", insisted Mike, "If somebody had 'em, and they bit a shamblefuck, would it turn back to normal?"

"You fuckin' idiot, Mike," I said, "Who the hell would bite a zombie? If the blood didn't turn you, eating a rotten carcass would still kill you in half a dozen other ways." Oscar nodded along in my defense.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, but what if?" Mike pushed. "OK, fine, what if you just spat in a zombie's open mouth?"

&#x200B;

"Nothin' would happen, 'cause *I'm not immune*, dammit," I snapped back, temper thoroughly lost, now. I looked to Oscar for more back-up, but he was staring into his drink. "Oscar, come on man, tell him he's an idiot."

&#x200B;

"I dunno", Oscar frowned, "I mean it sounds pretty stupid," I grinned, "But so did the idea of zombies until people started chewing on eachother."

&#x200B;

"You can't be fuckin' serious!" I looked in disbelief from Oscar, then back to Mike, who was grinning stupidly now at his intellectual 'victory'.

&#x200B;

"I'll BET YOU it works", Mike challenged.

"You'll bet what?", I glowered.

"I'll bet you a week of meal tickets that if you spit in a zombie's mouth it'll change back to normal."

"God damnit, fine, but when I'm right, you never call me Booger again, either."

&#x200B;

Mike lurched suddenly to his feet, spat in his hand and offered it over to shake.

I looked at it with disgust. "What the hell? Ugh, no. Let's just settle this." I stood, and Oscar looked dimly between us.

"What, are you guys ssserious?" Oscar slurred.

"Hell yeah, I'm serious", Mike said, unnecessarily loud in the quiet bar. I just shrugged, and we headed for the door of the bar. Oscar staggered to his feet and followed us out into the brisk chill of the evening.

&#x200B;

Industrial spotlights kept the streets lit, powered by an array of generators running tirelessly in the distance. We didn't speak as we made our way down the main road of our holdfast toward the Big Gate. Soon we were in the large clearing in front of the gate, moving toward a low, tin-roofed shed situated to the left of a low watchtower. Standing atop the watchtower, armed with a scoped rifle and a powerful spotlight, was the night guardsman. He must have heard our footsteps, because he turned our way as we approached. Mike and Oscar raised their arms to hail him, but he just shrugged and turned back to look over the wall.

A moment later, we were creaking open the door of the shed, and were hit with the smell of rot, the shuffling of feet, and the tell-tale moan of the undead. Mike was the first one in, so he grabbed a flashlight from a shelf by the door and switched it on. Apprehensive, I followed next, with Oscar right behind me. The interior of the shed was mostly occupied by a large chain-link cage occupying the back two-thirds of the building.

&#x200B;

"Here we are," said Mike, and moved to the front of the cage, where he rapped on it with his flashlight.

The zombies inside stirred. Two of them, in advanced decay, lurched up to the fence and rasped hungrily for flesh.

"Are we seriously fuckin' doing this, Mike?" My voice betrayed me, coming out quiet and strained instead of the incredulous disgust I was trying to convey.

&#x200B;

"Don't be chickenshit, Booger." He rattled the cage again, and shined the light onto the walker on the left. It had been a younger guy. Flannel shirt and jeans. All ripped up, now, caked with mud. His right arm, below the elbow, was only hanging on by sinew and shredded muscle. His left leg was snapped halfway up the shin. The other was an older woman, in even worse condition, the flesh of her face having sloughed away to reveal naked bone underneath.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, they gripped and rattled the links of the cage, and hissed at us, trying to force their faces through the fence to get a bite of us.

"Fine," I muttered, and straightened up my back and stepped forward. Mike handed me the flashlight, and I stood in front of the younger guy. I figured he looked kinda like Mike, and not at all like my grandma, so at least it wouldn't feel too fucked up to spit in its mouth. My mouth was suddenly dry, so I made a hawking noise in my throat to generate some mucus, and batted at the cage with the flashlight. When the zombie responded with a fresh effort to bite me through the cage, I spat into its open maw. It didn't even seem to notice.

&#x200B;

We stood in silence, looking at the hangry monster for maybe a minute, before Oscar concluded for us that nothing was going to happen.

&#x200B;

"There, Mike, are you fuckin' satisfied?" I asked.

&#x200B;

Rather than admit defeat, Mike groused, shrugged, and snatched back the flashlight. He flipped it off, set it on the shelf by the door, and stepped out of the shed, muttering darkly all the while.

"I want my meal tickets, Mike!" I called, as Oscar and I followed Mike out.
