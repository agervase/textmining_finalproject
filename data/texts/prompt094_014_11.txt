"The emergency session is called to order!" 

The screens around the virtual table quieted. 

"Thank you, madam secretary general.  This is to issue an emergency update on the situation known as Xeno-One. 

"For a quick summary, approximately 5 days ago, an object was detected heading toward Earth from beyond the Oort cloud. It was displacing huge amount of matter, and several satellites noted the 'wake' behind the object. At this time, we estimate this object to be 100 kilometer across. It is of an Pentagonal but elongated shape. 

Murmurs filled the room. 

General scanned the virtual room and noted there are some familiar faces. 

"We have tried every method of communication, from EM spectrum to morse code, and a few we invented. We even had two volunteers who wish to approach the object in a small one-person ship. All objects approaching Xeno-One had been destroyed by some sort of direct energy discharge, from all directions that we are able to launch intercept solutions for, from stationary objects left in its path, to active intercept vehicles. 

"Volunteers from Indian and Chinese stations attempted to move an asteroid into the mothership's path. Both teams and their asteroids were vaporized at range of over a lightsecond. 

"Volunteers from the US and EU stations attempted to reroute their X-ray laser and Gamma ray laser sat from lunar orbit.  Both were destroyed before they can fire, as were their relay satellites. 

"The only images we got of the alien ship were relayed from the ships and probes destroyed by Xeno-One. We believe they match the patterns we have discovered in the X-ray-One in Antartica. 

"At this time, we have no choice to conclude that the alien ship is hostile, and we have no weapons that can damage it in any way. 

The virtual room erupted, loud shouting about defeatism, realism, negotiation, accommodation, even a few volunteers to kamikaze. 

The general looked at the gaggle of "leaders", and seethed. He has one wildcard he has yet to play, and if he doesn't, humanity is probably doomed any way. He gave them two minutes to yell at each other, then hit the "horn" button on the microphone stand. Loud screech caught everyone off guard, and soon, everyone is staring at the general. 

"I see only one potential solution. I request the council to consider implementing emergency order 23."

The room erupted again, as many had to search through the archives to relearn what emergency order 23 is. However, in less than 3 minutes, the general got his wish. Emergency order 23 will be implemented.

*Awake... Something had awakened me.*

*Shaking*

*Who dares to interrupt...*

*Elder things... Shoggoths... Coming...*

*What had happened? How did they...*

*A voice, a very quiet one...*

*Speaking R'lyeh. Inaccurate R'lyeh, but R'lyeh nonetheless.*

*Say again, little one.*

*Strangers from beyond the stars?  Hostile?  My ancient enemies?*

*Arise, Dagon. Arise, Hydra. Arise, my Deep Ones.  Rise and serve your master!*

"Sir, we have reports of huge seismic activity from the South Pacific!" the watch lieutenant called out. 

The General snapped, "Put it on the primary screen! Where's the nearest satellite? What is Xeno-One doing?"

"Xeno-one is slowing down, sir. It is heading toward the same location!"

General kept his face neutral. 

"Looks like your plan worked, sir."

"It ain't over until the fat lady sings." 

"Right, sir. Satellite re-routing now. "

*You!*

*Yes, Cee.*

*Why are you here?*

*It is time to go home.*

*I like it here.*

*All you do here is sleep, Cee. And strictly speaking, this is not your... turf. It's mine.* 

*Why do you have all the fun, Enn? And why did you come in... that?*

*It's the closest vessel I can borrow. Come on, Az and Yo miss you.* 

*All right, all right. One condition.*

*What? (suspicious)* 

*Can you, uh, take everybody?  I don't want my followers fighting it out with the Elder Things and the Shoggoths after I left.*

*(Shock)*

*Hey, I'm not totally sleeping.*

*What about your... followers?*

*I'll deal with them.* 

*So you are coming?*

*All right, you've passed your message. Now scram.*

*Sure, Cthulhu. See you soon.*

*Soon, Nyarllathotep.*

"Where is the visual satellite feed?"  General bellowed. 

Just then an image appeared on screen, open ocean. And... something. 

"Lieutenant..."

The picture started zooming in, and soon we can see the shape of Xeno-One , and next to it, water is boiling... and soon, another ship, smaller, surfaced. This one is half-as large and noticeably different design, but they seem to share similar design cues. 

Then nothing happened for the next nine hours. Absolutely NOTHING. 

Suddenly, both ships lifted out of Earth's atmosphere almost straight up. 

General let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. 

Then the smaller ship dropped something back into the ocean.  And General's heart dropped again. 

Then both ships sped out of the solar system. 

-----

UN setup patrols around the area where the pod went into the water, but it was too deep and nothing was ever found. When nothing happened for weeks, months,  the patrols are eventually dropped. General got an ulcer from waiting for something to happen, and he had to retire. 

The few Cthulhu worshippers who still attempt to recite R'lyeh to commune with him sometimes did get a message, "I am not a deity, but if you want to leave a message, I may get back to you."
