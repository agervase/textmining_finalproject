My eye twitches as I sit at the edge of my bed, staring at the series of texts on my phone.  Though it might be in poor taste on her part, I’m not even angry that my girlfriend decided to break up with me this way.  I *am* kind of an asshole so it’s probably exactly what I deserve.  No, what irritates me is that she didn’t *just* break up with me.  She also confessed she’s been banging my twin brother for a while and decided she’d rather date him instead of me.  The hell!?  He’s even more of an asshole than I am!

&nbsp;

To save my phone from wrath, I instead grab the teddy bear she’d given me who knows how long ago and fling it at the wall.  “Fuckin’ devil!”

&nbsp;

I go over to stomp on it afterward to further vent my frustration, but the thing suddenly puts up its arms defensively as I lift my foot and says, “Alright! Alright!  You caught me!”

&nbsp;

I jump back in surprise, tripping over a pile of clothes in the process which sends me tumbling on my ass.  “Fuckin’ hell!” I cry out, partially from pain and the other part sheer bewilderment.  “What the fuck are you!?”

&nbsp;

The teddy bear stands and quirks its head to the side.  “Well, shit,” it says.  “You actually have no idea, do you?”

&nbsp;

Wide eyed and at a loss for words at seeing it continue to move around and talk on its own, the only answer I can manage is a stiff shake of my head.

&nbsp;

“Welp, no use hiding it now.”  The teddy bear’s shape waivers like a mirage, growing and morphing into that of a horned human male, with skin like charcoal and a face so handsome, I want to rearrange it with my fist so it doesn’t make mine look so bad in comparison.  That shit eating grin he flashes me at the end of the transformation doesn’t exactly quell my urge any either, but I’ll take the feeling of pissed over dumbfounded.

&nbsp;

“You ever consider taking anger management?” he asks.  “Cause if you didn’t know it was me, that bear ain’t done shit to you to deserve that.”

&nbsp;

“Fuck off!”  I pick myself up off the floor and cling to my anger to keep from freaking out again.  “And put some goddamn pants on!  Jesus.”  My eyes stay fixed on that irritatingly smug face of his.

&nbsp;

He holds his chin in his hand and looks me over.  “Ya know, all things considered, you’re taking this surprisingly well.  Most would be crying and shitting themselves by now, begging God for forgiveness and whatnot.”

&nbsp;

“Yeah, well, I’ve had a shit day and am in no mood for whatever the fuck this is, so…”  I point to the bedroom door.  “Exit’s that way. Now get the fuck out.”

&nbsp;

Instead, he steps toward me.  My mind can’t decide what to do with this heaping dose of adrenaline being released into my system, so I just stand there; heart racing; fingers twitching involuntarily.  I try my best to suppress it and put on a tough face, psyching myself up to kick his ass if he tries anything.  He doesn’t look that big.  I can probably take him.

&nbsp;

“This is exactly what I like about you, Tes,” he says, stopping way too close for comfort.  “Face to face with the devil himself, and you still tell me to take a hike.  And not even in that self-righteous, holier than thou type of way.  Just straight up GTFO.”

&nbsp;

I half laugh, half snort at his claim.  “Devil my ass.  I don’t know what I’m on or you’re on or we’re both on, but like hell I’m going to believe you’re the devil.  I’m pretty sure the devil’s got way better things to do than sit around my room disguised as a teddy bear.”

&nbsp;

“I really don’t,” he says with an almost melancholy undertone.  “Humans have grown into such evil little shits on their own that I don’t even need to bother meddling.  Take your girlfriend, for example.”  His eyes dart down to the phone that I had completely forgotten was still in my hand through all of this, its screen oddly still lit and the texts on display.  “Or should I say, ‘ex’?”

&nbsp;

I toss the phone onto my bed since I no longer had a teddy bear to serve as a surrogate to keep myself from breaking it.  Though breaking this guy’s teeth instead is starting to feel more and more appealing.  “So, what?  You want my soul or someshit?  Joke’s on you.  It’s not worth anything.”

&nbsp;

“Pfft, souls,” he rolls his eyes.  “You’re right.  It ain’t worth shit.  But you know what *is* worth something?” He takes a firm grip of my jaw and turns my head this way and that while examining my features.  All my motor skills decide to take a vacation without me as he does so.  I’m becoming convinced this is all a dream and I’m caught in fucking sleep paralysis, though that also means I’ll probably wake up soon, so I guess that’s something to look forward to.

&nbsp;

“It’s not every day I come across someone even half as good looking as me,” he says, still studying my face.  “I was God’s most handsome creation, ya know.  He doesn’t quite make them like me anymore. Though I gotta admit, you’re the closest I’ve seen in a good long time.”

&nbsp;

I don’t know whether to feel flattered or disgusted.  My hormones seem to favor the former, but I want to be the latter.  “Y… You know I have a girlfriend, right?” I sputter out as he gets an all too familiar look in his eyes.  I recognize it because I look at myself like that in the mirror all the time.  This won’t end well.

&nbsp;

“*Ex*girlfriend,” he says.  “Not that it would have mattered to you since you were fucking around on her anyway.”

&nbsp;

“How…?” Oh… right.  Teddy bear.  Like being caught on a nanny cam.  Jeez, how long was he watching me!?  “W-Well, then you know I only sleep with women, right?”

&nbsp;

“I also know you read a lot of yaoi,” he answers.  FUCK!

&nbsp;

“Y-You know what?  Fine!  Fine, you win!  Do whatever!  Not like any of this is real anyway!  Any minute now, that alarm’s going to go off and I’ll wake up next to my girlfriend and we’ll both have a big laugh at the whole thing!”

&nbsp;

He laughs and tosses me onto the bed like a rag doll.  “Whatever makes you feel better, man.”
