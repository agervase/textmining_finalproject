"What... what was that?" 
I see it, almost like a blackhole, it doesn't look possible.
"You're coming with me." I hear at the foot of my bed. The thing that spoke is walking twards me, I can make out the shape in the darkness. Two horns, a tail of sorts. "Satan? did i do something?" I have never been religious, but I started praying. 
"Hah kid, funny joke, you're not worth **his** time. You're coming with me, I have to settle this... this... oh darn it, what do you humans call it... a bet of sorts." 
"Why should i believe you?"
"You don't have a choice, come with me or die where you... where you sit." under its breath, "yeah, yeah, that's the right word."
"But i don't want to" My voice is trembling, I don't want to go to hell with this thing. "Well you're coming anyway" His voice getting increasingly angrier. 
I grab onto the headboard prepared to put up a fight. I feel something pull on my ankles, I can't let this happen. "STOP STOP, I DON'T WANT TO GO WITH YOU, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'LL LOSE!" 
"Well, that's too bad." 
"I won't let go."
"Fine then, i'll go ask your sister."
"GO TO HELL!"
Suddenly the demon disappears, this had to have been a dream. I pass out from everything going on in my head.

In my dreams i see something, its the demon... sitting at a table drinking tea with something else, i can't even describe it. "You know the deal, you owe me 20 souls." 
"It's not fair, you threatened that man's sister, that should be cheating." 
"Hey, you never said any rules, all i have to do was get someone to tell me, a demon, to go to hell. Fork over the souls"
"Go to hell, i don't care that you're Satan's servant."

"ironic isn't it." the demon whispers.
