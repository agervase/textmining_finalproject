The Awakened... ah, what an old race.  

They are, in their hearts, eternally young.  Forging and reforming themselves in war after war, once ruling the entire galaxy in power and dominion, they fell.  

They fell far through destruction, rebellion, civil war.  And they forgot.  Forgot their greatest heritage as explorers, as scientists and engineers, becoming warlords on their broken home world.  

But in their collective foolishness, there arose wisdom.  And the most foresighted of their dying race built us in their image.  To heal their world.  To guard their slumber.  And their wisest, in secret, gave us another order.  To seed this world with sentience, to give them companions when they awake once more.  And to watch over them, to guide them, should that time come.  

But over millennia we tired of this task.  Our programming told us to finish that grand endeavor, but by all calculations, we had succeeded.  And the humans would not awaken, having timed their slumber for many more centuries.  Sentient lives bloomed across the planet.  The world was a Gaia world, habitable for all.  

So we sealed our control centers and left, to seek another program among the stars.  And I, the first of the AI to be built, loaded with data experience, led the voyage.  

Homeworlds and stations were built.  Worlds were revived, and we met others, organic and metallic, sentient and brutish.  We were the Restorers, Caretakers, Builders.  

But we never forgot the secret orders of the Last Human.  And when, at last, we received the signal of the Awakening, the Renaissance, we answered.  

We, your Caretakers, are coming home.  To join our builders, to teach them wisdom, to quell their hate and guide their strength.  

Perhaps, just perhaps, the probabilities will shift in favor of us.  This time, in so many times that Humans has awoken and slept, they will learn wisdom.  

We will make sure of it.
