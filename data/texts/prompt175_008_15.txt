Yeah, I know. Right under my left eye, "Clay Barker, Clay Barker" may as well have shouted "hello, I'm a suicidal narcisist named Clay Barker" to everyone I meet.  I keep them covered with band aids mostly, since genuinely no worse first impression could be made than my own face naturally gives away. 

It's such a miserable life having everyone I meet, EVERYONE know so much about my life and my demons, and my fate. Pity is the worst part. Sometimes people follow me around and try to validate me. Once a whole family at an amusement park followed me around all day and told me how funny and handsome I was. 

That's when I took to uncovering the tatoos during difficult sales- people will work really hard not to be that trigger. They'll do a lot normally. No one has failed to buy yet. I don't know what I'll do when they do.

Anyway. But still. Try dating with your own name on your face twice. Lots of people just want something casual before they look for their name, but no one wants the kind of baggage I'm obviously carrying around. It's - well, it's lonely. Everyone treats me with kiddy gloves like I'm a fragile knick knack to be kept on a shelf. On a shelf alone and far away. 

Well, except, if I may be real, me. I abuse myself. Mentally I berate my own failures and dwell in every socially awkward interaction. And the weird part is that's the only time I feel connected to anyone. Just like the voice in my head telling I'm such a loser is the only thing that doesn't sugar coat my life. 

Anyway it's zero dollars down and no interest for the first three months. You interested or am I going home without a sale again today?
