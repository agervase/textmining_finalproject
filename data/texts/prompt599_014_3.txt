"Take...take these," the filthy beggar put his eyewear in my hand, as I looked at it in disgust. I had no interest in taking more than a life of my victims, especially obvious madmen that shouted at imaginary objects. So I shrugged, and pocketed it. He sighed contentedly, and his head lolled back. Once dead, I cleaned up the scene and prepared to leave. But the unfamiliar weight in my pocket made me curious, so for the fun of it, I put it on.

A man stood before me. My father, again. But he looked pale, haggard, as if he was suffering from a terminal illness. I cared not for him, though. I'd learnt to forget and disregard all feelings when I embarked upon my task. But he called out, his voice clear though his face wasn't. "Elrick, listen to me," he pleaded, his voice shaking with emotion. I didn't care, nor did I wish to, but something within me made me want to listen on. I smiled, raising my eyebrows. The voice continued.

"Elrick, you've been on this path too long. You...need to stop," the voice was choked up, filled to the brim with regret and guilt. Something within me...I felt some semblance of guilt too. For what? I didn't do anything wrong. But I knew, *somehow*, that it wasn't true. 

"You're still listening to me. So I know that you believe me. You're life is getting ruined, Elrick, and you're the only one who can fix it," my father continued, stopping and starting, as I heard sniffling in yhr background. My father never cried, as a retired Marine. He was a strong proponent of the age-old 'Men cannot cry' theory. I could feel it now. Feel what he meant. I was a good student, destined for a high-paying job at a law firm. Where did it all go so wrong?

*Where?*

"If you're hearing this, it means I...no longer can help you." As the last few words were spoken, a sudden, loud outbreak of sobbing came. I could feel the convulsions, see the twitching in his body. Something changed. I knew consciously now, what I'd done. 

*Your family. What's become of your family?* My thoughts aligned with the voice, as I dropped to my knees. The knife dropped uselessly to the ground, next to the body of the man I should have loved. A man who didn't deserve to die. A man who, even to the end, would sacrifice himself for me.

The recorder clattered on the concrete flooring, the recording finished. I didn't care about it anymore. All I could see was the blood, the spilled blood of the best man that lived in the tides of time. The sirens were cutting through the silence of the night air like butter, the sirens of the police I'd called for. I waited for the handcuffs and the noose of execution to take me. It was fated since I stepped upon the warrior's path.

Glasses were meant to see things clearly. But words can sometimes do so much more than images can.
