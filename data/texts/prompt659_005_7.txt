There was a little man at the end of the rainbow, he tried to fuck my life up but only helped my fame grow. I sat in central park in the frigid sweater weather while he laughed and retorted that my wordplay wasn't clever. My smart ass comments didn't make it any better so he cursed me with a rhyme scheme that would have last forever. I was sure he was a drunk so I didn't take him serious, but I couldn't think of words to say and it made me furious. Figured out a plan and hopped in my Ford Taurus, took a trip to the library and picked out a thesaurus.

2 months later and life has gotten greater, I have a little green man to thank for all the haters. Hate it or love it, lad, your curse on top, from 50 cents in the pocket to a milli that I copped. If you're wondering my sales have never dropped, but because of you I will never ever stop. 

6 years pass and I'm scratchin my ass on a custom made couch drinkin whiskey from a flask; I see little green outside standin in the grass, he was knockin on the glass when he broke through the window yellin Ima teach your ass! Rhymes are supposed to be poetic not for banging in the car, I say I'm sorry little man, but I think you're taking this too far. He says I've cursed a million people and they've always learned their lesson, but then i get to you and you're barely even stressin. 

I laughed in his face and cried I must have caught the funk, he pondered for a moment as to why his plan had flunked.
A lightbulb flashed and he muttered, "I must have cursed you drunk..." That was the last straw for me, I stuffed him in my trunk.
