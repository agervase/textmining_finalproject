"Here, child. Keep this bag with you and treasure it always -- it will provide you with anything you need in any situation." My grandmother told me as she handed me an old, worn leather handbag, passed down in my family from mother to daughter, generation to generation. My mum died soon after I was born, so it went a generation back for safekeeping until I was of age.

I didn't believe her at first about the bag's magical properties, but as I got older it turns out she was right. When I needed money for a fare, it gave me the exact change for paying my way. Until today. 

As I stepped onto the bus I take in the mornings to go to work, I reached into the bag as usual, expecting the ticket it normally gives. To my surprise and the annoyance of the others behind me, however, my fingers touched the cold steel of a handgun. Stepping aside to figure out what happened so the others in line behind me could pay their own ways, I kept digging around to try to find my ticket.

Of course, as my luck would have it, no ticket appeared, so I sadly walked off the bus and at a rush moved towards my workplace, only barely making it on time. A customer approached, looking for antique weaponry for his collection -- nothing we had in stock, but I remembered the gun the bag gave me today. I went into the back room to grab it, taking a quick look at the handgun and taking it to the front.

The man seemed pleased, inspecting it to ensure it was authentic, and offered the shop a large sum of money. I graciously accepted it, knowing my boss will give me a wonderful bonus for the sale. Seems my day turned around after all...
