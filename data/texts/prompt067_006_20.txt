**[0312]** Dr. ██████ █████: For the record, this interview is being recorded for future review, analysis and to serve as a means to decide course of action. Do you acknowledge this?

**[0312]** ███-████: *◼̨҉͏̷͜◼̷̀◼̷◼̵̧̀҉͘◼͏̕͜͞͞◼̢̢͝◼̷́͢*

*Note: Translation software indicates information was acknowledged. Henceforth, all dialogue recorded from* ███-████ *will be presented in translated format.*

**[0313]** Dr. ██████ █████: Your vessel was detected flying over ███ ████ ████, New York, approximately... fifty-five minutes ago. You then proceeded to land when and where directed. What is the purpose of your presence on this planet?

**[0313]** ███-████: I was curious about the rumors surrounding your species.

**[0313]** Dr. ██████ █████: And which rumors were those, exactly?

**[0313]** ███-████: That you could only observe a spectral depth composed of three main colors, with all observed variants being mixtures of those three.

*Dr.* ██████ █████ *refers to his tablet for permission to confirm this rumor. Permission is granted.*

**[0314]** Dr. ██████ █████: That's correct. The cones in our eyes only allow for that level of depth with the slight exception of tetrachromats. Have you not encountered a similar species or course of evolution in the universe?

**[0314]** ███-████: Oh, but of course! That is far from unique! What surprises me and others is how you have achieved this balance with the other inhabitants when all evidence states that you should not even be able to observe them!

**[0314]** Dr. ██████ █████: (Pauses) What other inhabitants?

**[0315]** ███-████: The [DATA EXPUNGED], of course!

**[0316]** Dr. ██████ █████: (Refers to his tablet again for several seconds before being permitted to expand his line of questioning.) I'm sorry, the what?

**[0316]** ███-████: The [DATA EXPUNGED]! The other sapient species that inhabits this world! Do you have a different name for them?

**[0316]** Dr. ██████ █████: Possibly. Why don't you describe them in detail for me and I can possibly correct any terminology? (Dr. ██████ █████ is commended for his quick thinking and poker face.)

**[0317]** ███-████: Oh, well... It's quite difficult to describe them if you don't perceive several other spectra of light. How would you describe *◼̷̀◼̷◼̷́͢◼̨҉͏̷͜◼̷̀◼̷◼̵̧̀҉͘◼͏̕͜͞͞* (Approximate translation: Navy Blue mixed with Bark Brown) to the blind you can cure, yet do not?

███-████ *thinks for several moments.*

**[0319]** ███-████: I suppose they are best described as the light that the leaves of plants don't absorb intermingled with the light reflected from a surface of a large body of water, but with physical form. Save for with your species of course. Yours is the only species that they seem to be completely intangible with. You walk through them and they you. The same goes for your respective ecosystems.

**[0320]** Dr. ██████ █████: Our ecosystems?

**[0321]** ███-████: Yes! For example, you do not seem to be affected by the vast majority of volcanic activity on this planet and can even live comfortably beneath the Second State Seas! Despite having no amphibious adaptations like those my own people display!

**[0321]** Dr. ██████ █████: The second state... I'm sorry, what?

**[0322]** ███-████: The seas composed of water's second state. The one it takes on when exposed to the spectra of your local star once reflected off the surface of [DATA EXPUNGED], your second moon."

**[0322]** Dr. ██████ █████: Our... I'm sorry, there seems to have been some confusion. Earth only has one moon.

███-████ *regards the doctor with a look that facial gesture translation software interprets as shock. It remains silent for several minutes until looking around with what is interpreted as realization.*

**[0326]** ███-████: You honestly cannot see any of this, can you? Or any of the [DATA EXPUNGED].

**[0327]** Dr. ██████ █████: See what?

**[0327]** ███-████: We're currently largely submerged beneath a king tide of the Second State Sea. This room has been steadily filling with secstate water. That's why all of the [DATA EXPUNGED] have left.

**[0328]** Dr. ██████ █████: (Alarmed) Are you saying there are currently unauthorized entities in this  facility?!

**[0328]** ███-████: Well no, not any more. They started to leave once [DATA EXPUNGED] started to rise. See? You can see it clearly outside your reinforced window near the ceiling.

**[0328]** Dr. ██████ █████: I'm telling you there is- Oh god. Oh my god, *where in the hell did tha-?* **What is all thi-?!**

*Dr.* ██████ █████ *is heard gasping and gagging, as if desperate for air. Several items are knocked around in his panic. On-site personnel are unable to lend aid as those listening in and close enough to render aid are exhibiting the same phenomena. After several minutes* ██ *personnel are dead. Autopsy reveals cause of death to be suffocation and extreme hypoxia.*

**[0332]** ███-████: Oh. Oh my. I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.

(Silence)

**[0333]** ███-████: Oh! Hello. What an ingenious device! What? Oh... Yes, I'm afraid it was after I pointed out... I see. I'm very sorry, I wasn't aware. Yes, I understand that you set the boundaries in place, I just didn't understand why. I'm... Yes, of course, if you're able. I would very much like to leave, I feel...

*Sounds indicate that* ███-████ *has moved to where Dr.* ██████ █████*'s body is presumed to lie.*

**[0333]** ███-████: I really am so very sorry. I didn't know you were a protected species.

*Response teams investigating the area found the bodies of personnel and the interview room to be locked and secured according to standard containment protocol.* ███-████ *was reported nowhere to be seen. At 0355 its ship was observed to simply vanish from sight, with all anchoring equipment falling to the ground, indicating that the ship simply blinked out of existence.*

*This interview and the species referred to as* [DATA EXPUNGED] *have both been deemed to be a Memetic Hazard and is prohibited from reading by all personnel that do not possess clearance level 3/1812.*
