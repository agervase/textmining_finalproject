Christmas fell certain and swiftly. It lodged in the eaves and window panes, scurried down the umbrellas, and swirled along the currents, dressing the city in a dotted dress of white.

It was a beautiful thing, yet always better witnessed from inside a snug bar with a steaming coffee in your hands.

I sat next to the window, and close to the radiator. It was the best of both worlds. I had the gorgeous view of the descending white at one side, and the tender warmth of technology at the other.

I took a sip of my coffe--.

The chair in front of me grated. I turned, and to my surprise I found a man clad in a black suit staring at me through kind eyes, while lighting a cigarette.

"I apologize for my rough intrusion," he said, offered me a cigarette.

"I don't smoke," I said, and frowned. "Can I help you with something?"

He took a drag. "You can actually. My name is Marcus, I'm one of the Two, but let's say my skin does age."

"Oh," I said, and the frown deepened. "What does a time travele--"


"Shh," he interrupted me, placed his forefinger over his lips, and looked around. "Please don't say that word out loud. There are many of us, and not all of us have good intentions."

"Could you please tell me what do you want from me, then?" I took another sip of my coffee, then drew a deep breath. "I have little to no interest in meddling with the issues of your *kind,* for lack of a better word."

"You've always been cautious," Marcus said, smiled a ghost of a smile, "and I've always loved you that way."

"So you know me."

"Of course I do. I wouldn't be here otherwise," he said, took a long drag, and hunched over the table, gesturing for me to come closer. I obliged. "In the year 2070 you will meet someone in New York. I need a message from you to that someone." He murmured in my ear. Then, we returned to our normal positions.

"A message? What sort of message? Who is that someone?" I shook my head. "What am I saying? I told you already, I'm not interested in your games."

"Something went over your head, John," Marcus said and smiled. "This time of the year, New York, 2070. What age will you be then?"

My brows knitted. I would be over a hundred years by then. "Are you implying that I--"

"Yes."

"How do you know?"

"Well, I'm one of the Two, I already told you that. You are the other *kind,* for lack of a better word."

"What sort of message? And who is that someone?"

"There are rules to these things. I can tell you she's a she, and the message can be anything you want."

I thought for a moment, dwelled on the information Marcus had provided me. He knew my name, and he spoke to me with an odd confidence. He couldn't be lying. But me, an immortal?

"Tell her that I wish her a happy christmas. Is that good enough?"

Marcus smiled, stood up. "You will know when you give it to her."

"Me? I don't understand, what do you gain from this?"

"You will understand when the time comes. She likes coffee too, by the way."

"What if I forget?"

"You won't. The message is already with you. It will come when the time comes."

With that, Marcus left.

**New York, 2070**

I was heading toward my usual bar, holding an umbrella to fight the ever-white snowflakes. I had my usual set firmly coffee on my mind. I looked forward to it with great eagerness. As silly as it might sound, those little things one looks forward to, are what'd kept me sane all this years.

Ahead of mine, a woman came out her home. She was glowing, save for the distress in her face when her umbrella didn't open.

"Excuse me, can I offer you to share my umbrella?" I said, giving her my best smile.

"That's very kind of you, but I'll be fine," she said, and kept struggling with the umbrella as her hair and clothes filled with little spots of white.

"I insist," I said and placed the umbrella over her.

"Thank you very much," she said, gave me a pearl-white smile. "It's lovely to know there are gentlemen still out in the streets."

We chatted awhile, until our paths strayed from one another.

"I have to turn here," she said. "Thank you very much."

"Any day," I said, "I wish you a Merry Christmas." I froze in place, locked my gaze in her sky-bright eyes.

"Is there a problem?"

"I--I--I." I shook my head. "May I invite you a cup of coffee? That is if you don't have any other plans, of course. I was heading to my favorite bar just now, and I can't let you freeze out there without a functioning umbrella."

She laughed, flushed slightly. "I guess that's the least I could do."

--------------------------------

**Two Years Later**

I touched her belly. "Have you decided on a name for our little one yet?"
 
Her lips parted ever so slightly. "I loved Joe and Tom. They are short and sweet names."

"They are, and I love them too." I wrapped my hand in hers.

She turned to me, her eyes sparkling. "But I have settled for another one. It's been in my mind for what a long time."

"Yes? Tell me. I'm sure I will love it."

The snow fell outside, slow and gentle. It settled on the bare trees and the floor beneath, creating an endless ocean of white.

She held my hand tighter, gave me a kiss on the forehead. 

"His name will be Marcus." 

I smiled. "That's a wonderful name."
