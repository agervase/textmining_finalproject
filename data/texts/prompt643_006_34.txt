The guard smiles. Blood drips from my mouth from where he hit me. "That'll teach you," he sneers, uncuffing me and shoving me into the tiny, isolated cell. The door slams shut. Alone, in the dark with my thoughts all I can keep thinking is, *Teach me what? What did I do?*

"Jeannie, calm down."

As soon as the words left the man's mouth, there was an internal groan from everyone around the conference table that was almost palpable. Everyone knew that if you wanted Jeannette Parker to calm down, the *worst* thing to do was to actually *tell* her to calm down. 

Jeannie flared, throwing her shoulders back, cheeks flushing and eyes flashing as she leaned forward to stare the man down. "I will *not."*

He shrank back in his seat, eyes swiveling around for help, and finding nothing but coworkers that were suddenly preoccupied with their notes. Swallowing, he turned back to those sharp, green eyes that chipped slowly away at his ego, and nodded. 

Triumphant, she straightened and continued on with her previous point: "This system isn't working. Prison is supposed to *rehabilitate* people. But how can these prisoners be rehabilitated if they don't even know what they did in the first place?"

It was a good question. Everyone shared looks, but no one had any good answers. 

Undaunted, she grabbed some papers off the table and waved them in the air. "Has anyone read these? A majority of the prisoners who are released go on to commit the *same crime* that they were convicted of in the first place!"

"So," one courageous man said, "what do you want to do? The way it's set up now guarantees that no innocent people are sent to jail. I think that's a small price to pay. And," he added quickly, "in the old system, it wasn't like it was working so well, either. Criminals are criminals. It's in their DNA."

She smiled. "Exactly."
