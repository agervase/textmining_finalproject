Before I can comprehend the horrors in front of me, the screech of metal on concrete echoes through the room. I jerk my head towards the source, only to quickly cover my eyes from the beams of light emanating from the opened doorway. A shadowy figure stands idly at the entrance.

"Test subject 3285B?" a hoarse voice crackles.

"Yes," I utter, as terrified as I am confused.

"I apologize for the inconvenience," the figure steps forward from the light, revealing a middle aged man wearing scrubs. "But we don't have much time."

"Okay, what-" I'm interrupted by the man.

"Or should I say, I don't. You seem to have plenty." The man bellowed a hearty laugh that echoes through the room and into the deepest recess of my brain.

"Who are-"

The man releases a loud, heavy sigh, "Listen, the schedule is all messed up," he paused, grasping the bridge of his nose between his thumb and index finger, "Please don't start this again." A frustrated grunt and, in a single movement, the man steps towards me, hurriedly grabs my arm and begins walking me towards the door. "Come now, we gotta get you back."

"But what about," I try to ask the burning question at the front of my mind, what is this violent room I'm in? But as I reach the door, the man spins me around and, without sound or emotion, removes a syringe from his scrubs pocket and stabs my neck. Instantaneously my body goes limp and I fall backwards into a wheelchair. In my last moments of consciousness, I witness a great flash of light erupt from the room.

"You're late," the man whispers in my ear, "Or perhaps, *you're early*." I see a familiar figure in the room, before the same scraping of that steel door on the concrete flooring crackles in my ears, and I lose consciousness.
