I laid there, silent. A small amount of blood beaded up from the scratch. I was just staring. 

“Hey man, are you even listening to me? We have to go,” my cat said. My cat. Talking. To me. Impatiently, too. 

“Uh...” 

That’s all I could manage. 

“C’mon man, we’re running out of time! You’re dying!” It was almost a whine this time, you could hear the meow in his voice. That was Ayaz, alright. 

I slowly got out of bed, getting to my feet. I felt a little unstable, and not just on my feet. This was weird. Ayaz meowed again, this time more hurriedly, and started to leave my room. I followed him. He brought me down the stairs, to the home phone sitting in the kitchen. 

“Look, you need to call 911. Tell them you’ve just had a brain aneurysm. You’re suffering a traumatic brain injury and you’re bleeding internally. Tell them our address.”

“I, uh... seriously?” That was not what I expected. 

“Stop wasting time, guy!”

I picked up the phone, and dialled 9-1-1. I repeated back what my cat told me to. He had to repeat it a few times too, I kept forgetting. The operator told me to keep the line open. I put the phone in my pocket. 

“Good, they’re on their way. Look, we need to get you to the front porch. You’re going to pass out.” He started walking to the front door, and then meowed by the knob. I chuckled a little. It reminded of me of when he wanted to be let out, and he would stand there and whine. This time, I obliged him. Opening the door, I stepped out onto the porch. 

“Sit.”

I did. 

“You’re not going to remember this, probably. But you’ll be safe. And that’s OK. I just want to let you meow meow meow meow...” 

I passed out, the sound of sirens echoing in my mind.
