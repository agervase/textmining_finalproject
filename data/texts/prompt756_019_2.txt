A puzzled expression paints Shens face as he looks in to those pitch black, dark eyes, void of retina, something out of a horror movie really. Death, of course wearing a suit and tie, just smiles at him and vanishes with a grin on her face.
Looking down at his invention, or rather, our invention. A fully developed philosophers stone. A tincture of crimson within a small vial. It is but a drop, void of what appears to be physical constraints.  
It holds itself together and seems to reject the vial. Right next to it is the card death gave him. However the picture of his fianc√© reaches his eyes as it stands there, framed upon the desk.  
Death probably knows that this was not for him, but for her. We were on the very verge of discovery, just a few days ago.  
She died before it could save her.  
Perhaps Death is right. Living way past what any human should live is unnatural...  
**No.**  
She would not want this. She would want me to go on living... Right?

Shen takes up the vial and cannot help but to have a gentle smile on his lips as he caught himself looking at her picture one more time as he leaves the laboratory. Having arrived in the kitchen, he takes one of the knives from the magnetic board. He runs the edge along the length of his right forearm, cutting deep and causing him to grimace in pain as a thick stream of blood runs down the length of his arm, dripping in large amounts on to the cold kitchen floor.  
He turns the vial and lets the crimson, almost glowing tincture drop right in to the deep cut within his arm, he watches as the tincture seems to merge with the amounts of blood and before long..  
**THUD!**  
He passes out almost immediately, sinking to the ground and many hours go by before in the morning a neighbour knocks on their door.  
**No one answers**  
The police eventually have to open the home forcibly. Glass shatters as the two officers finally break through the door! Expecting the worst, with one hand on the holster of their guns, they slowly make their way in to the kitchen to find..  
Shen lying on the ground, bloody knife by his side, laying in a large amount of partially dried up blood right there, the officers rush to see if he is still alive or has a pulse, but they are too late.  
Death stands there, smiling still and the officers do not appear to be able to see her.  
Shen stands by her side, watching his lifeless body before the Reaper would take him.  
"Why?" he asks.  
A few painfully long moments pass and the answer almost sounds as though Death cannot help herself from laughing, her voice rising and falling as though she is about to break out in heartfelt laughter.  
**"Did nobody ever tell you that you cannot cheat Death?"**
