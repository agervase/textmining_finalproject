With the sun finally setting over Kross City, having narrowly avoided disaster that day, it's savior sat on the couch with the TV on eating a microwave dinner. David Green was his name and yet the world knew him by a different one; one he would forever regret saying.

"Today Kross City rejoices as we narrowly escape what would have been a tragic event in the downtown core." a news reporter said on the TV. "Due to the daring efforts of I-Don't-Know Man..."

David let out a sigh. There it was. The mistake. His words taken out of context had sparked an Internet viral video that was spiraling out of control.

"We have a clip from the event that took place today taken by one of the people that was rescued." The TV reported continued.

David saw himself on the screen standing before the known supervillian Nega Xor. David was Standing with his hands sheepishly in his pockets and a confused look on his face. Nega Xor, on the other hand, was on his knees trembling and pleading for his life. "Dude, that was amazing!" Said the person recording the shaky video before asking the fateful question. "Who are you?" David with his mind very boggled still working over the confusion simply said, "I don't know, man."

David turned off the TV. Maybe this was all some elaborate joke. Maybe it would go away. He looked over at his phone which somehow had over nine hundred new unread messages. Many of them were messages of thanks, some were asking for help. One message in particular from the country's president had him lost for words. Another even weirder message was welcoming him, I-Don't-Know Man, to the League of Heroes.

David let out another sigh. He had blown his one opportunity. Mind boggling events or no, David wished he had picked a better name.
