“I think i got super AIDs” i told my brother. 

“Jesus!” He proclaimed, “But your only 18 you havent even left the village yet and you JUST found someone to bear your children, i told you to stay away from those brothels “

“I havent gone to any brothels”

“Then how dud you catch this illness, only if that healing ability can be used on your self”

“Thats the problem, i have been using it on my self”

“Huh” he said with a questioned look

“All the people i been healing, i havent been healing them. I BEEN STEALING THIER DISEASE!!!” I cried

“Hey, little brother its ok. Have you told you wife” 

“No once i found out whats happening, i cut off with her before the disease took hold so i wouldn’t kill her with my love. No one else knows....What am i going to do i dont wanna die in suffering so young” as I continued to panic i broke a cold sweat

“Hey hey, calm down its gonna be alright. Who all did you heal?” 

“Everyone, right down to every prostitute and elderly. Once the final illness set i doubt i will have months, probably not even weeks to live”

“I got an idea” he said coldly 

“Join the ranks, who know how to use a sword and your even better than me with that flintlock”

“But, what about baby Samuel”

“This is for him and Charity, what do you wanna leave them both nothing.... look if you get far in the ranks before this curse take you, you will get compensated very well”

“Its not enough time, i can get promoted that fast”

“Doesnt matter” he cut me off, “even if you die im the field every thing you earn will be sent back her, something is always better than nothing.”

“alright i go the day after tomorrow, i love u john. I-i couldnt ask for a better brother”

“I love you to stalin” 

“HEYYYY! THEY’RE SAYING TWO VILLAGES OVER THERES ANOTHER MIRACLE HEALER!!!” Screamed a man running through the streets.

Me and my brother looked at eachother with a devious grin.
