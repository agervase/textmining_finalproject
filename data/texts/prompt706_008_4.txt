Every four years there is an exam. It's kind of like the SAT or MCATS, but in all honesty, it's a shitfest. The person with the highest score becomes the ruler of the almost-monarch.

This year, a child genius by the name of Johnny Little won. He knows nothing about policy or international affairs, but rather math, science, and English. You ask him to point to Australia on a map and he will point to Hawaii. What a genius.

The politics of this country has become a scam. None of the questions on the test represent any political knowledge but instead information on STEM-based intellect. It all started when Donal Trump wanted to steer America in the direction of science and technology. Making America great again (in only two fields of study).

Johnny Little's inaugural address started off like this: "I have a vision. A vision for America. Three-hour school days, four day weekends, four-month summer breaks. And no grades". Anybody with half a brain could see the problem here. By limiting education of others, it assembled the strength to Johnny to continuously get the highest score on the exam. As everybody else gets dumber, he becomes smarter.

In the year 2044, Johnny Little remained on power without any other competition. In fact, the test became so unfair that he got to decide the questions on the exam. There was no doubt in his mind that he would ever lose his presidency, if it can even be called that anymore. As everybody else became dumber, he started limiting knowledge from books and the internet. He also cut communication between citizens and other nations. Johnny essentially became a dictator and rules all of America.

After 50 years of rule, Johnny died from a heart attack. The country no longer had a leader and without any intellects, nobody knew how to rebuild the economy, its politics, or reestablish international affairs. The country had gone wild and seemed to self destruct.
