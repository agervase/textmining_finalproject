"Empress, I failed you.  P3a-S768-A4-G519 remains fully under the control of its indigenous apex species.  Those *humans*," Sarsi spat the word into her comm, "still hold many of our ancestors hostage on the Origin Planet.  I understand this is not the news you wished to hear after so many generations sacrificed everything for us to find it.  Yet I am the last of our initial strike team, and I fear I may not last much longer.

"We were forewarned about the humans fighting skills -- laughable given that we out mass them by over fifty percent; their claws are dull and short; their eyes barely function in standard lighting (we are fortunate ours can handle the bright lighting they use!); and they are *slow*.

"We were told of their weapons.  Crude projectile launchers and explosives.  Light battle armor was all we needed to counter these, and our expeditionary forces were fully equipped.

"What nobody warned us about were the food and the --" Sarsi shuddered, then tried to remember where he left off.  "It's one thing to be approaching a *human* and hear them opening a ration container, but something entirely other when the pleasing scent of a gourmet meal wafts across the battlefield.  Many of our scouts fell for this ploy.  They were led into giant boxes where the faint sounds of more food being being offered could be heard.  In mere [days], they seemed to forget about the mission and simply lounged around waiting for the next meal.  As a side note, something must be done about the food during transit.  It weakens morale and if the next force is to have any chance, they must not be slaves to their stomachs!

"Surveillance continued and we soon learned that some of these lost souls would follow humans into smaller boxes with wheels.  The smaller boxes would leave and return without the scout.  Several [hours] later, the small box would leave again, and return with the scout in the back.  The returning scouts appeared woozy and no longer wore their body armor.  Those damned *humans* simply smiled, put flat ropes around their necks, and led them back into the large boxes.  Sometimes the humans would scratch the scouts' chins or behind their ears!  Such intimate acts!  These evil vermin must be destroyed!

"Bewildering as it was, the humans started letting our former comrades outside unattended about a [week] later.  These former soldier appeared completely uninterested in returning to join us in our fight.  We could smell them, so of course they could smell us even from our cover in the nearby tree lines.  They would simply nap near--  You may find this hard to believe, but humans keep large, open artificial ponds near their homes.  The lost ones would take naps by these and seemed completely unperturbed when tiny humans would climb over them or--" Sarsi paused to collect his thoughts.

"I went through training with Sevri.  He is a long-haired dark-fur from the northern forest region.  During boot camp, we went to a bar, and he drew blood when a female dared to touch his tail without asking.  He is as bloodthirsty as they come.  Yet when a small human (*chi-ild*?) approached him during a nap and started to groom his tail with a spiky brush, he **purred**.  I knew him.  He was fierce!  Surely this was a trick to lure the human in closer!  But no!  He rolled over on his back and permitted this chi-ild to brush his chest!  I wouldn't let my own mate do that!

"That's when I learned the true secret of human dominance.  They. Control. The. Dots."

Sarsi tried to think a way to convey the dangers entailed here.  "The humans would simply point, and little dots would appear.  The first time this happened, the remains of my squad leaped out from cover and raced down the hill to attack it.

"These dots trigger something primal in us.  They aren't quite a threat and aren't quite prey; yet they can **not** be ignored.  Worse, they can not be killed.  I watched just one dot take out my entire squad.  Every. Last. One.

"They would follow the seemingly random path the dot followed; prepare to pounce; land firmly with front paws right where the dot was; and find it crawling over their paws!  The evil dots were faster than our best, yet controlled by these slow humans!  A dot could run behind a tree, then suddenly be on the tail of the soldier chasing it!

"The dots do not tire, though the humans controlling them seem to.  After [a couple hours], the humans would send the dots away, and curl up against our exhausted former soldiers.  There should have been nothing left but a bloody pulp and a couple of the less savory organs, but these impossible creatures seemed to have no fear of being around us.

"I must sign off now.  This will likely be my last report.  I grow weak at the smell of the humans' lures; and every time I see the dots, my resolve weakens.  I'm attaching my current coordinates.  Please have the next team rescue me when they arrive...  My apologies, Empress.  I failed you and our ancestors."

"And on the lighter side..." beamed Angie Ankor, glad to finally have something other than politics to share with her audience. "A local viewer has discovered a large number of amazingly oversized domestic cats.  Each is larger than a lynx, and yet they appear to be quite docile once they have a couple meals in them.  With nearly two hundred showing up so far, she is struggling to find enough good homes for them.  Please call the number at the bottom of your screen if you are interested in a lovable, furry companion."
