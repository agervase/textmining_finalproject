Clarissa watched as the pentagram in the floor burst into colourful flames. In a split second, he appeared.

 "Alright Clare, I helped you summon him, now make your deal," Magnus said, his eyes transfixed on the creature in the centre of the room. 

"Asmodeus, I call you hear to make a deal," she said, "I've heard that you're the right demon for my particular request."

Asmodeus looked at her with clear disdain, then his focus turned toward Magnus. His lips formed into a wicked smile, and he chuckled loudly to himself.

*"I see, you brought a warlock here for the summoning. My dear Magnus Bane, what brings you here to your father?"* He asked.

Magnus Bane's cat eyes glared at the demon, "I'm here to help my young friend here, to make sure you can't find any loopholes to use for her harm."

*"I still don't understand why a prince of hell was your best bet. I do not like to be bothered by the measly wishes of these filthy mortal beings. You know, at my side, you could be the greatest warlock ever known. Instead, you turn away from your father and dally with humans and those filthy Nephilim creatures, the demon killers."* He let out a low growl at the mention of the Nephilim, then continued, *"Oh well, if you don't want to know your full potential, I suppose I shouldn't pry. But what of you, little girl? What brought you to summon me? Choose your request carefully. It better be important or you may not come out of this alive."*

Clare smiled. He actually thought he could threaten her like that. Prince of Hell or not, all demons were bound by the same rules. For one thing, they couldn't get out of a pentagram until the deal was done and they were released. The only exception to this rule, she knew, would perhaps be Agramon, the greater demon of fear. If one summoned him and their greatest fear was him escaping, then that's what would happen. She studied Asmodeus for a few seconds, then shook her head, still smiling.

"Nice try Asmodeus. But even princes of hell cannot voluntarily escape a pentagram they are summoned to. You are bound until I'm finished with you, and therefore you cannot harm me. Magnus wouldn't allow it." As she talked, her voice was strong and her tone contained no fear.

Asmodeus's face contorted with anger. How dare this idiotic girl summon him then talk to him like this. With no respect at all!

*"Very well then child, I will play your game for now, but you will pay in the future. What is it you require of me? Make it quick, I have more important things to get to."*

Clarissa moved closer, so she was only about an inch from the edge of the pentagram. She beckoned for him to come close as well, and whispered her deal into his ear. "As soon as you meet this agreement, you are free to go back to hell. How wonderful it was to meet you," she smiled slyly as she spoke.

Asmodeus' eyes briefly narrowed at her, then he smiled. *"Of course. Farewell, Clarissa. And Magnus, my dear son, if you ever change your mind, the gates of hell will ever be opened to you"* 

With that, he vanished in a plume of fire. The deal was done. Magnus sighed. "I really hope this works well for you, Clarissa, my father isn't rather easy to work with, though I'm certain I got rid of all loopholes that he could usually use. Good luck." 

Clare nodded, and turned to leave. Now that she had finally done it, she felt so much lighter than before. She only hoped everything worked as well as planned. There was nothing else to do, in the end.

In case you guys are wondering why I switched from calling her Clare and Clarissa, her full name is Clarissa but she always prefers Clare.
