I should have never taken the deal. I only did it because I felt trapped; the only certainty the future held was more of what was already abundant. Death.

When the vampires first contacted me, I nearly shat my pants in terror. There I was, scavenging for more bullets to use against the dead, and a mob of blood-fanged meth heads seemingly materialized out of thin air. Their bodies were gaunt, bones protruding through their sickly white skin, and their serpent tongues forked between their fangs. The animal in me could do nothing but freeze, like a deer paralyzed by the marching whistle of a freight train. One of them started moving towards me, as if gliding across ice, and I looked into his eyes.

It looked as though a black hole had vomited on them, they were pitch black and littered with shimmering spots, as though they were windows to a far away galaxy. But as I got a proper look at the face that wore them, I saw something far too familiar in this day: fear.

The vampire introduced his clan to me, and begun to explain their religion. He told me that the plague that was eating the living wasn't the result of a bioweapon attack, as many survivors believed, but a result of "heretic" vampires. You see, according to him, if a vampire stops sustaining themselves with the blood of the living, they start to slowly rot and lose their minds to hunger, never to recover. He said that this was taught to all newbloods, but there was a sect of vampires that stopped believing in the religion. These vampires willingly stopped consuming blood, lost all semblance of themselves, and started the plague.

After the vampires explained this, they offered me the deal. They told me they had been watching the large community of survivors I was working with, and our base we had built out of an old federal prison. They told me that they would turn me, which would grant me immortality, if only I let them in while everyone is asleep...

... to be continued.
