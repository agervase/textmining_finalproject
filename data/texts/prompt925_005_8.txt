It was the dead of winter and we just broke through a thick ice patch, the crew of our ship were all exhausted and half frozen. Weary of winter we braved the vast empty ocean, days turn into nights as nights turn into days and we see no man or any sign of life until One day, the rest of the crew members drag themselves to the side in some kind of trance. I'm unaffected by whatever's happening to them... I then hear it, a son- "SIRENS" I gasp. I see each and every one of them as we near them. I don't really see the appeal of them... They're some of the most ugly disgusting things That Thor could ever make, and the singing is even worse. The singing makes me want to jump ship and swim back to the frozen arctic seas. To each of my brothers in arms I shake and yell at each of them and yet none snap from their daze. Is there anything I can do? A thought pops into my head and I sprint to my bunk and grab my bow and all the arrows I can find. I sprint back to the deck and start shooting. The sirens scream, the men drop holding their ears screaming.
I continue shooting the sirens, three men stand up from the daze and pull their bows swords and whatever else they can find out and help me against the sirens. More men stand and fight. The sirens are soon dead, their wounded are pulled on ship and are raped and killed.  I am praised by my brothers and all around me, drinks are to my honor. Valhalla will be waiting, but None will be traveling tonight. Our king asks me how I resisted the sirens calls. "Well, umm, I'm gay."
