Everyone considers me a genius, the kind of guy who always knew the right thing to say at any given time and could take control of a room with just his words. It is true that I'm gifted, just not in the way people expect.

When I was ten I began seeing things. Every time I got a test I knew the answer without even bothering to study. If I got a test that was multiple choice the answer was highlighted. If it was fill in the blank, the words hovered the space until I filled it in. Eventually conversations went the same way, I could see the words hanging above their head. If I followed the words exactly the result was always positive. 

That's the reason I became a therapist, because I could give people the epiphany they were looking for after just one visit. It's where I felt that I could do the most good for the average person. I'm highly respected in my field and considered one of the best by both patients and other therapists.

It grows boring though, never having any uncertainty. I feel like an actor reading a script, I feel like nothing I say or do is even the real me. Sometimes I wonder who the real me even is. I don't deserve the recognition that everyone gives me. That's why I tried being my true self for the next patient.

Needless to say it didn't go very well. I was constantly stumbling over my words looked distracted from trying to avoid the words hanging in the air. Everything I thought I learned seemed to leave my mind at that moment, I was completely useless. She was trying to cope with the abuse she suffered for years at the hands of her parents, and I couldn't  help her without my gift. Eventually I couldn't do it anymore and read off a script like I normally do and everything clicked into place like it always does.

It's a boring life but the look on her face when she knows that everything is going to be ok makes it worth it.
