The time is coming, im running out of time to make my decision. 6 months ago this Friday it happened, im scared of the truth.

Im just your average highschool student, average grades, average looks, nothing out of the ordinary. I live in what most would call the projects, my family has always been less than fortunate. We always managed to receive the short end of the stick in life. We barely make it by most weeks, mom often sacrifices meals for my sister and I. She says shes not hungry but I can see the pain on her face. The only thing I have going for me is my girlfriend Min. Ever since she came into my life I cant help but be happy, my only light in what feels like endless darkness. 


Then it happened, I get home after a long day and pass out. I had the most vivid dream, I was standing in an auditorium of sorts with multiple seemingly cosmic beings. Some 30 feet tall, others made of stars, like nothing I could of ever imagined. They all stood up formally and bowed to me. My attention was directed to a podium and everyome sat. The man spoke:


"Hello young one, my name is AI. To your race im known by many names, I am the God of earth. Or atleast I am for now, you see thats why were here. You see in six months an election will be had similar to your country to decide a new God of earth. But this election will be special, we unanimously decided to elect one hunan from earth who could fill the role of God better than us who are just on lookers. You have all the necessary qualities, empathy, and life experiences to properly lead an entire race of people. But this comes at a price, should you decide to take the position you would cease to exist in your world, you would never have existed and everyone you know and love will forget about you. But you will have the power to shape the earth in a way that will make life better for everyone, or on one, the choice is really yours. You have until your 18th birthday, or 6 months, to decide."


And then I woke up.
