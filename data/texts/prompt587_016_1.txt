Alexander stared at the woman who was also escaping down the window with an even stare. She was a breath-taking sight under the moonlight, her hair was white as snow, silky and long, her eyes were like the beautiful sky on a clear day, her skin was like porcelain fine and clear of imperfections.  

Alexander hated her at first sight she seemed too perfect like a queen who sits above her servants watching disdainfully down below, but by the look on her face she seemed to hate him as well.  

As they both softly touched ground they turned to stare at each other, their eyes focusing on nothing but the other and with surprising synchronization both gave the other the middle finger and stuck out a tongue at each other.  

Alexander glared and straightened himself murmuring an insult that he made sure was audible enough that she would hear it, catching the reply she sent to him that questioned his ancestry of him being a either a monkey or a particularly nasty breed of bug that crawled in dung.

As they both turned to walk down into the street, falling into step of each other they both started bickering with one another, only united by the fact that they were runaways and an understanding they were both using each other to keep away from an unwanted circumstance.  

Unknowing that said circumstance they were running from was one and the same.

"Bitch," bit out Alexander stuffing his hands in his pockets.  

"Bastard," the woman, whose name was Alice he later learned, hissed out both fists clenched tightly.  

And so they went, bickering with each other until they settled somewhere and married, managing not to kill the other as they lived and died together. Unknowing that they other was their partner for the arranged marriage they were so desperate to escape from.
