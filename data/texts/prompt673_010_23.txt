Death reached out a cold hand to his oldest opponent, a sad, knowing smile on his bone white lips. "It is time, old friend," he said, his voice like a crackling fire under the stars. 

Life gave a bemused smile. "Old friend, is it?" she asked, her own voice like clear water from a stream. 

"We've had our ups and downs, but together we make quite the pair," he replied. 

"You take what I give. I hardly say that is a team, my dear Mortem." 

Death cringed inwardly at her cool reproach, at the formality behind his Latin name. "A balance, Life. Without me the world would have been chaos. Without me, there is no respect for you." He saw her rigid indignation falter slightly, her golden eyes suddenly full of a melancholy understanding. 

Tentatively, she extended a slim, warm hand to accept his. Then she stopped, hesitating. "I always got the feeling you rather enjoyed what you do," she said, a note of accusation coloring her voice. 

"I enjoyed ending suffering. There was much suffering, Life, despite your best efforts. Everything in between was just... Work," he replied calmly. 

She slid her fingers into his. "And do you enjoy ferrying me away to your realm?" she asked. 

"Well, I did tell you in the End it would be my time," he said, his red eyes dancing like embers. "There is nothing left for you to give, dear one. What you did provide was glorious, I can admit it. But the last star has burned out. I have ushered in the last soul. The circle was always just one long line. And it ends here." 

"Perhaps. Though Life always finds a way, sweet Death," she smiled as she stepped into his boat, her eyes gleaming mischievously. 

"Okay, Life." He smiled as he set off down the black river. He would not take her hope from her, not today. After all, hope was what made her... Her.
