when i put the batteries in the statue of liberty is eyes went bright and i woke up to the sound of its turning on. it was pretty big but not oversized. the day it came up to me i told him she was really speciail because not all statues come to life and it never happens. when more people saw here they called the government and they came looking for her and found her easy since she was big like the statue she is. i tried to hide her in the garage but she was to big so they found her and they took her away and i never saw her for 3 years. after those years i saw her they had her on the news and it turns out she wasnt evil like the government thought she was just misunderstood. that is what the french wanted her to be like all nice and thats what they did we just didnt see it. after awhile though people started thinking she was a spy since why would another country give us a statue for no reason right. the government was after her again and they took her this time to a more secure place to test on her. it turns out she had turned into a living being and started her own thoughts so thats why she wasnt like what the french wanted. she had turned mean while the french wanted her to be nice. so the government got mad and told france to take her back but they didnt want to so we sent her back anyways and a big trouble started because of that. they turned her into a robot no emotions no feelings. the statue i had become friends with was gone and now a cold hearted monster stood there. once we jumped in the lake and the wave caused the town to go under they sent her to the desert and thats where she is now. sometimes i write her and i hope she gets it but i dont think she does. i want her to know i miss her and i dont think she is evil
