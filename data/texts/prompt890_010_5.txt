"Now, Mark, welcome back, how are you doing?" His gentle manly voice beckoned my response.

"Fine. Just. Fine." You reply quickly, gripping the fabric sofa cushion tightly in your grasp.

*"I know you're listening."*

"Not been hearing any voices, have we?"

"No no no no. No voices." You struggle to smile as your mind wonders and you hear it again.

*"I know you're listening."*

"Are you sure, Mark? You look awfully tense. Try to ease up." He insists. "Have a glass of water if you like." He ushers at the plastic cup beside you.

"No no no no. I'm fine. Perfect in fact." You attempt a smile but there it goes again...

*"I know you're listening."*

Who was trying to catch me listening? I don't like to listen. It's below me. These mind-blind asshats are so annoying.

"Mark. Why are you lying to me?"

"Lying? Why would I lie?" You quiver in fear, afraid he'll clock onto your abilities.

"Well, Mark, you admitted yourself here remember? You believed you were among the 1 in 200 humans who are indeed psychic when you stepped into my clinic all those years ago. Do you still believe that?"

*"I know you're listening."*

"No." You wheeze, grinding you teeth at the non-stop voice calling out for your response in you head. It was never ending. Non stop. And you just wanted it to stop!

"So, please answer my question truthfully Mark. Can you hear any voices?" He said more sternly this time.

You pause for a moment.

*"I know you're listening."*

"Yes... Please make it stop. Whoever is doing it please make it STOP." You burst out in tears. It felt good to cry. And scream.

"Mhmm..." He replied. "Maybe next week you'll do better." He smiled, ushering the Security Officers over. "Return him to his room and up his doses." He instructed the Officers and supporting Psychiatric Nurse.

The staff nodded and proceeded wrapping you back up tightly in your straight jacket. You didn't fight them. You weren't ill. Just psychic. Like the rest of them. You were part of the 0.5%. You smiled madly to yourself as they lead you away.

'Still hearing voices in his head. Not a psychic.' The doctor wrote in his journal.
