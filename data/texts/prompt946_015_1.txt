When I read that letter, I was in shock. Not just that I had magic, but I had too much potential to be taught. My greatest dream, come true! Magic powers! Powerful magic powers!
I call my parents up, first my mom, and then my dad. They both have similar reactions, but I sense that they are holding something back. Something that could change everything. Later that day I confront my dad, asking what he knows about me and my magic. 
"I'm just as surprised as you are."
"Dad, no bullshit" I say, and just to see what happens, I try to sound all magical.
"Tell me everything"
To my shock, he tells me a story.
"When I was your age, I too applied for a magical school. I was accepted, and had a few years of learning, which I enjoyed, as I had made many friends. In fact, that school is the place I met your mother. But then one day, we were in a lesson. Something happened, and a close friend of mine died. I don't remember what truly happened, but they later told me that my magical power was too strong, and so it was forced out of my body. Your mother too was quite powerful, although she didn't experience anything like what happened to me. But, when we had you, we feared you would have more power than the two of us combined, so we stopped using magic, and left anything related to it behind. And now, our fears are confirmed. Even the school recognizes your power."
I stand there in shock, unsure what to do, until an idea comes to me. I attempt to channel magical power within me, and it comes. I feel all-powerful for a moment, and then, something explodes inside me, and my world goes black. I later find that my burst of magic destroyed the entire house, as well as my parents, but I, the user, had no lasting injury.
Physically, I was fine, but mentally, I was changed.
I never used magic again.
