The old Earth was bad enough. Humans have never been very nice to each other. I could never understand the murders, rapes and just pointless violence they gifted each other on a daily basis. Back then my job was to preserve their innocence with a little bit of Christmas magic, and then pray it would be enough to make it last throughout their lives. 

That was then, and now is now. 

I see it all here from the North Pole, every child, every hurt they suffer. There is so much hurt now. The world is in the hands of the “strong” and the rule of law is gone and the weak our without protection. But, I see it all, and I take my notes. 

It’s time. 

The elves have packed the sled and the reindeers are ready. I used to do a little jolly speech, but nowadays all I have the will for is a nod to the elves and I’m gone. So is the laughter we used to share. 

Space and time have no meaning to me on this night and I instantly appear at the my first destination, a old ruined shelter. Huddled behind the walls next to their fires are a group of raiders. I watched them attack a survivors shelter not long ago. They killed everyone as they laughed. The men were butchered, but the women and children had to suffer for longer. 

But, I saw it all. For 364 days of the year I’m cursed to watch powerless. 

Not tonight.

My sleigh no longer carries gifts for children in the form of toys or warm clothes. It’s packed to the brim with instruments of death. I of course don’t really need them, I could do the job with my hands. Sometimes I do. The anger is too much. 

I no longer give the gift of hope. This world is lost already. 

This Christmas I deliver vengeance.
