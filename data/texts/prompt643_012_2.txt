The technology was not meant to work against the accused but FOR the victim.

Dr. Hawthorn Started development of the procedure.

He did so, because his daughter had been raped. She was terrified of everything.

Dr. Hawthorn wanted to help, and he figured if he could just remove the memory...

&#x200B;

Ten years has passed. Dr. Hawthorn successfully  removes the memory from a human.

Not his daughters, as that memory was too old.

&#x200B;

Twenty years has passed, as has Dr. Hawthorn. Ironically it was his murderer who got

the first 'non lethal' injection.

The murderer can't remember the killing of Dr. Hawthorn, the doctor's daughter remembers, though.

&#x200B;

Thirty years has passed. So has Emily Hawthorn, the doctors daughter. It was not murderer, just old age. The 'A.M.I" (Amy--Anti Memory Injection) is taking hits from various organizations.  The fact that it was 'cruel and unusual punishment' was the major factor.

How could you rehabilitate someone, who has no memory of the crime?

&#x200B;

Forty years has passed. The long term effect of "AMI" is now being felt.  The protestors are out 'en force', the public wants changes. Various doctors , both legal and...other...are trying to find other uses for AMI. The most common is having a memory you don't want to remember, such as a rape, removed.  The overall 'healthier mental you' campaign has begun.

&#x200B;

Fifty years has passed. The AMI treatment has been cut from government use, at least on prisoners. The mental health field has taken it over. They use it 'in conjunction with other therapy' to treat people. (Basically the use is a 'quick fix' for short term memory eradication').

&#x200B;

Sixty years has passed.  AMI has been refined so that select memory loss is a normal part of psychiatric treatment.

The 'Anti AMI' coalition is created, again.

It seems that for the past forty plus years the, 'alternate protection service' has been using AMI on key people in the government. Making them forget certain bills, or even dates they were suppose to be. A coalition was funded to study if this was true or not.  All bodies involved soon found themselves victims of AMI, thanks to the 'APS".

This has been a common practice for the "APS" for decades.
