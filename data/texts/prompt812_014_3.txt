"Don't be afraid, you are the one that chose not to abort the energy that drove such a brutal conception, and you ended many before me,  I am the only memory that remains of that brutal Kidnapping when you was just 3 years old"

Mary sat in her box room situated in the basement of the three story Victorian Town House in the heart of Camden Town London, the man who she thought was her Father was being arrested for murdering, who Mary knew as Mother.   Mary had spent the last 10 years of her life in a boxroom in the basement of a Town house, the only light came through the swirling air vent on the wall, by the boarded up window..

The labor pains came every 10 seconds now, and she was petrified to make a sound, the torture associated with disobedience kept Mary frozen with abject fear.  The Golden Dragon had the same voice of the faceless observer in her dreams Mary recognised his tone, His name is Justin he was always the voice of reason, all her dreams had Dragons, Unicorns, Giants and Elves in them, and she had not seen a Tv, did not know the internet existed, she was only allowed the KJV Bible and Mother read it to her, Mary had never seen or played with another child.

" Now pay attention this is important I have stopped your labor pains,  I know your only 13 and when you give birth to me, i will be taken from you,  that name that's been with you throughout your dreams?   

Mary nodded her head in amazement,  

"You will meet that name in the flesh on your 19th Birthday, the Birthday Present that you never thought possible."

Mary was considered mute by her captives, her kidnapper was a QC, a pillar of the Bar and the Country,   
who lived in the Countryside with his family, whilst his Camden Town House was his working Home, or the place he told his wife he used for work, in reality it was a hub for human trafficking, and a Prostitution HQ for the elite.

With a clear yet trembling little voice Mary asked the Golden Dragon, "who are you?"

"I am your Son, I look forward to seeing you on your Birthday"

At the Dragons last word, Mary screamed not from the pain of labor, not from pain at all, her dreams were true he's here..!

&#x200B;

"Hey get  this basement door open NOW" the scream reminded the wpc of the reason why she does not do horror movies or Halloween, the whole Town house went completely silent for what appeared  like an eternity,,

 Bang!! Bang!! Bang!! the locking system in the reinforced door was like a bank vault.

" Get the DOOR open NOW!! "
