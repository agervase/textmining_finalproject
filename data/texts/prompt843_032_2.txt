7212. 

7212 times I had sat in this chair and smelt my new born babies head. I'd been told many times 'The smell is like nothing you've smelt before', and I'd agreed submissively in return. But this smell. My child's... 

7212 times I had looked, for the first time ever, into my daughter's fresh blue eyes and felt the completely consuming pull of unconditional love. 

7212 times I had looked at her face and seen mine. Took in the strange feeling that she was half of me and I was half of her. 

7212 times her tiny fingers with their miniature nails had grabbed at my nose. Brushing it delicately, but firmly enough to let me know she was here, alive and strong. 

7212 times my tears had poured down my cheeks as I came to the realisation that I was a parent. 

7212 times I had felt the fear lurch through my body, like fire roaring first in my heart, then out into my veins and arteries, burning and choking all good feelings I had. 

7212 times I had come to the realisation that I was all she had. A scared little boy trapped in a man's body.  How could I care for something, someone, so perfectly helpless?

7212 times the pain washed over me as i realised she was gone. Forever. 

7211 times I realised that was why I had lived this day again. 

7211 times I would tell myself that I would live the day just one more time. 

7211 times I would tell myself that to live the day again was my last chance to see her... My very last chance. And once it was gone. It was gone. 

7211 times I told myself that after this one I would carry on. I would let her go. 

7213 times we would wake to each other's faces. 

7213 times she would dress whilst I took in her blossoming round belly and growing bust. 

7213 times I would smile in appreciation and she would tut in mocking disapproval. 

7213 times we would eat breakfast, eggs and toast.

7213 times we would laugh at the morning tv whilst our dog bounded up at us pleading for attention. 

7213 times we would laugh at him, tell him to calm down. 

7213 times I would grab the lead and turn around to see... 

7213 times i would see her face realise it had started. Her face contorted in a mixture of fear and excitement. 

7213 times I would, I would... Watch. 

7213 times only. Then. Then I would let her go. And my, our, child and I would start are lives. Together. Together alone.
