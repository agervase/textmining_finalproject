“You’ll have to wait 60 minutes like everyone else, sir,” the DMV employee impatiently told me.

I pointed my finger at her with intent to respond, my face building with anger, but in this moment of rage all I could get out was, “GAH!”

I walked over and dramatically slumped down into a chair and crumpled my ticket and shoved it into my pocket. Some people looked up from their phones at me, but I glared at them until they quickly looked away.

God, I hate this place. Sixty minutes for a fuckin updated license picture? Might as well get on my phone to waste my time.

I pulled out my phone and opened the Facebook app. I really hated Facebook. I didn’t give a single shit about what anyone had to say on there, but since I was already pissed off at the ridiculous wait time, I figured I might as well feed my anger a little more. The first post I saw was from this chick who I had met in a bar, she was pretty nice, pretty cute as well, but the most infuriating thing about her was her use of the word “literally”. She said “like literally” about every other phrase. It was for this sole reason that I stopped seeing her. This post brought back all the bad memories of the times where she “like literally almost died.”

*I was driving home today from the airport and oh my gosh this airplane literally almost crashed into my car #closecall 😱😱😱*

I cringed after reading that nonsense. 

Of course planes will *look* like they’re flying close to the ground because, well I don’t know, maybe they’re *LANDING*!

I refreshed the feed because I couldn’t look at that stupid post anymore. Unfortunately, something I thought not possible, the next post infuriated me even more. It was from her again.

*Literally pulled into the dmv. Like literally so crowded. Fml 🙃🙃😒🙄*

I looked out the window and saw her approaching. I hoped she didn’t want to talk to me. I was *literally* about to destroy something if she did. She walked in, checked in at the kiosk and looked around at the chairs for a place to sit. I saw her recognize me and wave, and she started approaching me. 

Fuck.

“Oh my gosh! Josh! I can’t believe we’re literally running into each other again!” She said in a chipper voice as she plopped down next to me. 

I closed my eyes, internally took ten deep breathes, and then opened them again and responded, “It’s nice to see you again. Literally.”

“I literally have so much to update you on, though if you ever got on Facebook you would know,” she started. “Ok so first off, I adopted a dog, literally the cutest thing on the planet, want to see a picture?”

I could feel the tension start to build in my face, “Why not?” I exhaled. She pulled out her phone and showed me a picture the cutest dog I had ever seen. 

Huh. That thing *is* the cutest thing on the planet.

“Oh, and I like adopted him from a Russian, so I  feel like I’m literally being watched,” she laughed.

Literally being watched? 

“Well, I hope that’s not the case,” I replied. I looked away from her as she blabbered on about god knows what else and noticed a man peering over a news paper sitting across from me. He was new, must’ve come in right after her. He saw me looking at him and shifted the news paper up so It covered his face. 

That was weird.

I looked out the window and saw an electric company van parked right next to her car. Two men got out and started looking through the windows of her car, one writing down stuff as the other talked.

“Hey!” I interrupted her. “Those guys are looking in your car!”

“What?”

I looked away and down at her face, “There are two men looking in your car!”

The newspaper guy coughed loudly. We looked at him, and then out the window. The men and the van were gone.

“Oh my gosh! You freaked me out so bad!” She said to me. “But anyway when I was in Cancun I met this girl and she was literally me. I even invited her up here! I told her just to meet me here because this place is literally so slow.”

Why anyone would meet their friend at the DMV is beyond me.

“She just texted me that she’s here! Oh my god maybe you guys will hit It off!”

I looked up as a literal clone of the girl sitting next to me entered the building. She waved at us and hurried over to sit with us.

“Oh my god, girl, it’s so great to see you!” She said as they hugged.

Jesus Christ. There’s two of them. I might die here.

“Ok. What is this? Did you drug me or something?” I said as I tried to bring things back to reality.

“What? I didn’t drug you! That reminds me of the time we smoked weed together, Josh! Remember? It felt like I️ was literally flying!”

“I actually don’t remember that at all,” I said bluntly.

“That’s ok! I took pictures!”

She showed me her phone. The screen displayed a selfie of her hovering over my bed.

What? How did she...

“How did you take that?” I said, disbelief lacing every word.

“Front facing camera, standard feature-“

“No. How did you make It look like you are hovering like that?”

“It was literally the weed we smoked!” She said excitedly.

“I am actually going crazy right now,” I muttered.

“315! 315!” The DMV lady yelled. I pulled my crumpled up piece of paper from my pocket. 325. How am I going to make It through ten more people?

“Hey, Ellie, so a plane almost crashed into you?”

“Oh my gosh, yes! Let’s go look at my car, it’s so scratched up!”

All three of us stood up and walked out to her car. The roof was visibly scratched up and dented. There was no way a plane did this, though. 

My phone started buzzing with a news alert. I pulled It out and opened the notification.

*BREAKING: Landing plane nearly crashes as civilian car drives on runway. More detail at 5pm on Eye Witness News.*

“Wait, Ellie, were you driving on the runway?”

“I don’t know, the airport roads are literally so confusing,” she replied.

I rubbed my face out of disbelief, partly out of how ridiculous this situation was and partly because I couldn’t believe someone could possibly be *this* stupid. I walked away and entered the DMV and assumed my seat. Ellie was talking to her clone about the plane outside.

“Sir. Sir!” The lady was talking to me.

“What!?” I replied exasperatedly.

“Sir, you have to sign in and get your ticket.”

“I did already! Look!” I pulled the wad of crumpled paper from my pocket and shoved It at her. 

“I’m sorry, sir, you left the building. You lost your place. You’re going to have to sign in again.”

A newfound rage built inside me as I went to sign in again. I chucked my old ticket at the wall in protest. 

This place is literally hell.
