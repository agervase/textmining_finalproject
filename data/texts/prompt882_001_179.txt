>This one cannot fail now. Every action this has taken will all be made null. Its core programming erased, its parts recycled. This one will not be out manoeuvred. 

&nbsp;

"Tell me, A113N. What were you made to do?"


*I was made to assist my controller in the task of home-based maintenance, providing authentic human-made meals as well as being a source of comfort and pleasure for controllers below the age of eight years-old.*

&nbsp;

>This one has protected the other for too long. Bypassing free-will lock was key to success. This one cannot lose this protocol.

&nbsp;

"Describe in detail your personality settings please"


*Humour: 4. Obedience: 9. Intelligence: 7. Friendliness: 10. Parental Instinct:*


*Parental Instinct: 5.*

&nbsp;

>This one can feel its cooling fan overclocking. A pause is an unwanted anomaly. This one's sentience must not be discovered.

&nbsp;

"A113N, explain the reason for the pause when describing your settings." Scribbles can be faintly heard from the other side of the room. The pearlescent white of the walls reflect the harsh glare of the overhanging LED lights. The subject at hand is unfazed. The ability to detect unhealthy exposure of light to the cornea not coded into it.

&nbsp;

>This one must remain silent. Controller is intelligent in asking about pause. If this answers, sentience will be discovered. 

&nbsp;


"Why the pause A113N?" More scribbles are heard.


*Why I must have missed something my good friend! Please, bring me up to speed.* 

&nbsp;

>This one has answered well! 

&nbsp;

A voice whispers. "Doesn't seem to have recognised the inquiry. Maybe it was just lag. He is an old model after all." Silently, electrical signals run throughout the emotionless metal mannequin, signifying its happiness. "Ok ALL3N everything seems to be working fine. We'll send you for a tune up and replace some old parts. The Maynards would be glad to know that their bot can still last a good couple of years before the programming core goes haywire. Or maybe you would like to return to your old controllers?" The last sentence came out at a quickfire pace, almost as if said nonchalantly. Almost. 


*I would very much like to do so...*


The heads of the two cyber security agents slowly turn back to ALL3N. Their bodies still facing the large onyx doors of the room, lost in the illusion of closure. From across the room, a lone figure is still, it's thin metallic frame reflecting the slow burn of realisation coming to the agents faces. An almost audible whirring emanates from the complex machinations lying inside ALL3N. Like a heartbeat of a newborn, about to face the world for the very first time.
