"Soon, my friends, we shall arrive in the New World, and their women and riches will be ours!" roared Sigurd, his imposing stature at the front of the longboat, banging the drums to the rhythm. The other Vikings roared loudly, except for Lars, who sheepishly made feeble "Roar, yeah, rape them," sounds under the noise.

"Lars!" bellowed Sigurd, his knotted orange beard billowing in the wind. "Are you not excited about the whores? About the blood of men that will stain your axe? About the rich land that will be ours to take?" Lars, whose beard was nowhere near as impressive as his comrades', shrugged. "I guess."

"By Odin's beard, Lars, what has gotten into you?" asked Asmund, a fierce warrior who wore a pelt made out of cows he had hand slaughtered and eaten the flesh of. "Have...have you been shaving?" Lars continued rowing to Sigurd's drum beat. "I mean...I felt like a new look, you know?" he said, unconvincingly. "I didn't feel like the whole...I don't know. The masculinity thing. It's not me."

The other Vikings roared with laughter. "Masculinity! Not his thing!" Erik yelled in a way that recalled the fury of a berserker. "Lars, you crack me up. When we get to land, the first drink on me. And the first wench I find, I'll let you have your way with her." Lars tried to look excited at the prospect. Realistically he'd like to skip the whole maiden part and just have Erik to himself. Erik and his long...dripping...hard...c-

"Hark!" shouted Sigurd. "I hear a sound upon the waves!" Lars stiffened, in more ways than one, and tried to hide his blushing cheeks. Sure enough, there was the sound of a woman, singing. Sigurd's stature slackened. "Men! Row in the direction of that voice!" he bawled, as his compatriots swung the boat in a southwesternly direction towards it. The voice was beautiful, angelic, somehow inhuman in its quality. Certainly a voice unlike that of any Norse woman. Not even the lovely Celtic women had such voices. It was a voice unlike any other. The boat began to row towards it.

The voice became louder and louder until it almost seemed to come from any direction. An assault of song. The Vikings began to row at a maddening pace, crashing against waves. It was then that Lars saw what they were rowing towards. A rock. "Er, guys," Lars said. "You, erm...maybe you ought to row away from the rock. Before we, er. Crash."*

Sigurd simply continued pounding the drums. "Onward!" he bellowed. "Onward!" the men, excepting Lars, bellowed back. Lars squinted. Sitting atop the rock was a beautiful maiden. Ethnically he could not place her; she resembled a Celt, a Briton, the Roman women he had seen, a Persian, and even in some ways a Moorish woman. Noticing her entrancing effect on the other men, he realised what he must do.

Lars jumped up from his wooden seat, his leather jacket (a hand-me-down from his cousin, who had killed the cows he used to make it and eaten them himself, naturally) billowing in the wind. He called out to the woman. "Wretched woman of the sea, let these sailors pass on their way unimpeded and I shall do you no harm?"

>*Impossible*,

 sang the siren.

>*There must be a mistake.*

>*I was told no man could resist*

>*The charms of my voice.*

"Well whoever told you that didn't count on one thing!" Lars shouted.

>*And what would that be,*

>*You doomed sailor?*

"Men like me are immune to your charms! And now I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't soon forget, bitch!"

>*What lesson is that?*

"**DON'T FUCK WITH A BOYLOVER OR THE MAN HE LOVES!**"

The Siren's eyes widened. In her thousands of years of luring sailors to their deaths, not once had she come upon a man who preferred the allure of men to her curves and her voice. She had only a few moments to consider this before her head was split open by a harpoon that Lars threw at her, and she tumbled into the sea.

Lars grabbed hold of Sigurd's drumsticks.

"Turn to starboard, turn to starboard!" he yelled, as the boat drew nearer and nearer to the rock. The men paddled furiously away, and just narrowly missed the rock, and soon, they were in calmer waters.

Lars breathed a sigh of relief. He was then grabbed by the shoulders by Sigurd. "Lars..." he said, in a very angry tone. He loomed over Lars, his eyes burning with a rage, like he was about to throw Lars overboard.

"Why didn't you tell us you like taking it in the ass, you son of a bitch?" he laughed. "We're your friends, Lars, we wouldn't have said anything."

"Yea!" shouted Halvard from the back. "You're still the same Lars. It doesn't matter who you like to fuck. As long as you do it as **violently as possible.**"

Erik stood up and approached Lars calmly. "Lars, I, er. I don't know to put this, but...I kind of like men too. And women. But also men. And, er...well, you're quite cute. Maybe when we get back to land we could...I dunno...rape and pillage together?"

"I'd like that, Erik," Lars said, blushing.

"I'd like that a lot."
