The world slowly faded to black as I drew my last breaths. Hey, I lived a good life.

But there was no gates guarded by an angel. No booming voice of God. I didn't see Buddha's paths or any of the Hindu gods. Hell, I'd kill for a pile of spaghetti to take me in his noodly embrace, but nothing was here! 

All I got was... black. The kind of black you see during the credits of a movie. A pile of text ascended from the bottom of my vision up to eye level.

"Alexandra Oliver Weston, welcome to the Afterlife Redistribution of Karma System (ARKS)! Let's review your life decisions and see how you did, shall we?"

The scrolling credits kept going, but instead of showing who was in my life, showed me every action  I was a part of and how many points it added or cost me.

* Age 3, broken wrist: -10 points.
* Age 4, broke wrist again: -15 points (lessened since not your fault.) 
* Age 4, entered elementary school early: +30 points
* Ages 7, 12, and 13, attempted spelling bee: +5 points each (total: +15 points)
* Ages 9-15, did very well on district mandatory testing: +20 for meeting expectations, +10 bonus for exceeding (total: +260 points)
* Ages 11-13, bullying incidents: -5 points per year (total: -15 points)
* Age 17, graduated high school in top 20% of your class: +150 points

It kept going on like that for what felt like a good hour. Everything added up- even small things like giving a friend 5 bucks impacted it a bit. 

Finally, the last action scrolled away and the cherry text scrolled back into view:

"Final Karma score: 148. Not bad on your run!" 

"Now, you have a choice. You can spend your points to enter the afterlife, or you can donate them all to a child just being born and give them a boost. Please state your answer after the beep." Then came that oddly familiar **Beep!** of a recording device wanting your voicemail.

"Give them all away." I blurted out almost immediately. I don't know how these points work, but  I'd rest better in the dirt knowing some kid got a break from them.

The text redistributed itself to change the message: "Decision made. Thank you for your contribution to ARKS!" That was the last thing I saw before it faded into black. 



(May give this a part 2 once I get back to my laptop.)
