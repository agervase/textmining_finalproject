My name is Rebuild Anima. I am an abomination in this shared world - in my parents sense. They told me I'm a new hope, hence Rebuild. Anima is much straight forward. It's soul in Italian. Why am I an abomination? This world make it so anyone with same name acquiring the same knowledge without much effort. Sounds cool, right? It is not. Trust me. With me being the first of my name, I am as pure as the driven snow.  

A little back story. My parents come from a line of Name with invasive knowledge & skills. My father is a *Hack*. Every *Hack* can do many invasive tasks such as stealing identity, privacy invading things like that. My mom is a *Clone*. Every *Clone* is a master of imitating & forgery, be it credit cards, complicated computer coding, even toys. You name it you'll get a clone, only that it'll always be a tier down from the original & pretty fragile. Now we go to Cyrus Hack and Ye-Jing Clone - my parents - an unorthodox among their respective Name. They believed knowledge & skills is not something to be shared without effort. Means they believed in individual of learning & discovering rather than an individual with pre-installed program. So when they first met years ago, they know if they ended up having a child, the child will be a person who'll grow up learning & discovering. They would rebelled against their Name, against the world; so I - Rebuild Anima - can grow up empty as a birdâ€™s nest in December and can be taught anything & everything. Before I forget, all the knowledge & skills in this world is acquired by names & won't be taught to outsider. Not even through marriage. Not even by love. Legally. But everyone knows they can learn another's knowledge & skills. They prefer to honed their specialty to utmost level & monopolized the field with man of the same name. Let say you need a plumbing done, you'll automatically call for a *Drain*. *Drain* is a plumber for the whole world. Sounds awful, right? Told you so.  

We circle back to me, Rebuild Anima. Since childhood my parents thought me everything they know. At age of 7 I can already make a clone of a credit card & hacked into the holders account to erased all trace of it's usage. Pretty neat. Thanks a lot *Hack* and *Clone*, your knowledge & skills is a life saver. That is only a tip of things I can do. At age 10, I stole a person identity & enrolled to their school in their stead. My parents don't like it at first but they settled as they too wanted to see if they're correct. They wanted to see knowledge & skills be taught to another person out of Name. It is super cool for me to obtained the swordsmanship of a *Tsurugi*. School in this world is more or less a place to tell people of how to used their knowledge & skills. It all about should, would & efficiency. A *Drain* always knows how to do plumbing, but they aren't necessarily knows how to build an efficient plumbing. If a *Drain* is not taught of how to, you'll ended up with a tap that have no water inlet. But there's always a class of slow boot peoples that needed to be taught from scratch. Much to my dismay, that is my class. But all is well I'm not a slow learner at all.  

I keep doing just that. I keep stealing a person identity, altering some stories about *me* & learning their knowledge. *Ramen*, *Corsair*, *Atom*, *Thread* to named a few. I'm unstoppable. My parents worried sometimes but most of the time they regressed. That is until I met a rather odd Name one day. A name I taught long since extinct. *Magia*, a Name of people with magical power & otherworldly knowledge.  

I'm excited & nervous at the same time. I wanted their knowledge & skills. I wanted it so bad I don't know how to hacked my way in. I mean I literally can't make a clone of ID card with *Magia* on top as that Name is so rare it was assume extinct. I need to do this the old way. The way my parents thought me. The way I should've used all this time in place of stealing identity & lying my way for the knowledge & skills. I have to tell them my intention to learn their knowledge & skills. I have to show them my sincerity to learn & not to reap.  

"Hi! I'm **Rebuild Anima**".  

And, that is how my adventure begins.
