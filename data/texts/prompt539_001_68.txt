Paris was burning.  The quiet, still glow of fire shown on the horizon.  Reynard desperately wanted to be there. He wanted to celebrate the revolution.  He wanted to burn, riot, and steal.  He wanted to find a woman, any woman, and enjoy her right there on the lawn of the palace.  He wanted to see blood.  He wanted to taste it, to feel it in his veins, to hear it rushing through his head.  

But no.  Instead, he was at the midwife's.  His wife lay next to him, screaming in pain.  He wiped the sweat from her brow.

"Why today?" He thought to himself.  "She couldn't hold on another week?"

Contempt grew.  His wife seemed fine at first. She was homely, but was the daughter of a merchant. A tailor, he remembered.  However, as time went on he found his home flooded with people.  First, her great-great some-odd grandmother, refusing to die, moved in.  Then, her uncle moved in to care for the old hag.  Her sister was widowed and moved in with her children; 3 boys.  They could have been helpful, if two hadn't died of the pox and the other had half a brain.  To top it all off, his wife had been pregnant 5 times, and only produced him 2 children, both daughters.

"Curse it." He thought, twisting the handkerchief wet with his wife's sweat.  Beads of sweat fell onto his shoes.  He didn't notice.  His eyes were on Paris.

A priest was present.  His wife had lost 3 children, and the priest knew today might not be different.  He prayed loudly.  Reynold hated his droning voice.

The child's head appeared.  It was grey and ugly. It looked dead, but Reynard knew better. 

"I'll be stuck feeding him too in a few years.  Hopefully this revolution changes something."

The body came out smoothly.  His wife clutched at the sheets as she pushed out the afterbirth.  She had made it through.

"Merde" he cursed allowed.  It was a girl.
