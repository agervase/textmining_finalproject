"Katie don't go play in the basement it's not safe! Come back up, aunt Miriam wants to give you your Christmas present!"

The man was taking his time walking down the stairs, I could hear his slow steps, uneven, could hear his hand glide over the handrail, clearly, he was using psychological torture on the poor child.

I took this moment to study her, she was smiling, and excited, obviously she saw that someone could help her against her obviously abusive father.

Suddenly she turned around "Daddy, look, I found a better boardgame!".

Oh, poor child, so far gone that she deludes herself into thinking that this beast of a man wasn't going down the stairs to beat the snot out of her!

He was almost to the bottom of the stairs, and responded with "Katie please, its not safe to wander without telling anyone, we were so worried!"

That's when the man came to the bottom of the stairs and I could see him clearly.

He was wearing a [Blood Red Sweater](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wrw_0w72ojyrlen0_3gAqZZbwJE/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:strip_icc-!!-/2017/11/13/642/n/43094957/7e9f1bd13a44a331_Screen_Shot_2017-11-13_at_9.23.54_AM/i/Tree-Rex-Christmas-Sweater.png), which obviously symbolized the blood of the countless children that he beat.

Gripped in his hand was [some kind of alcoholic beverage](https://www.planetchristmas.com/siteimages/EggNogPint.png), by Satan Himself! This man was clearly a drunk!

With all this evidence I could discern the true nature of the mortal creature before me, clearly, he was a child beater, after all, men always abuse when they are drunk, and never scream unless angry, its not like they can get worried about their children or anything like that.

All of this took place in less than a second, and with that, I knew what to do.

I may just be an assistant, but even the lowliest of demons possess arcane power!

I conjured a ball of flame in my hand, the fire cast light on the man's face, shocked, good, I threw it at him and he burned into ash.

The little girl was screaming and crying, clearly, out of relief of not being under her father's abusive yoke anymore.

But I still had work to do, after all, I could sense the life-force of other mortals above this basement, and what kind of creature would I be if I didn't help a child out?
