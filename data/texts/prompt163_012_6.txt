David Attenborough: The male homosapien is one of the most devastatingly inept animals at courting a female partner. Millenia of practice displaying social worth has been lost in recent years and the average wooing attempt results in the female feeling uncomfortable and the male feeling suicidal: a consequence unheard of in nature’s infinite diversity, until now.

Watch here as a beta male tries to improvise a request to socialize by sneaking a letter into a prospective female companion’s locker. You can see he realizes he forgot to add his name to the correspondence and now his anonymous letter, which was written just above the brink of legibility, falls on the wrong side of the cute/creepy event horizon. Theoretically there is a way to crawl oneself out of the Creepy Black Hole, but it requires a much greater level of attractiveness than our subject has to offer. All hope is lost but unfortunately it’ll take more humiliation for him to realize it.

Using our high-speed cameras we can see a small increase in moisture along the inseam of his $19 denim jeans, indicating the female target is near and he has no evasive maneuvers in his arsenal—he is, after all, just a beta male. He runs over to the bubbler and rehydrates as he surreptitiously watches her movements from under his arm. She begins reading the letter, stops, looks around to see who her suitor might be. The male remains safely hidden for now. After a few moments he reasons she has all the information to make his approach a skillful one.

He whispers a greeting from a hoarse and pathetically weak voice. The woman screams as he touches her arm, causing him to scream in return. Both subjects run in opposite directions, burying themselves deeper into the complex jungle of human interaction.
