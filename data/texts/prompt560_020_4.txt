“Okay uhm, god are you trolling?” 

He looked down upon me, clearly disgusted I would even question him. He sighs deeply.

“No, my son,” he proclaimed defeatedly. “Like I said before, this is a new feature my angels recommended I implement.”

“So your angels copied God of War?”

“My son, don’t test my patience.”

I needed to take a second to compose myself, I can’t believe god really copied of God of War.

“So if I do this new game+, will I be a child prodigy?” 

“Well in most cases yes, but uh..” god muttered while he thumbed through my file. “All you were ever good at was masturbating.”

“What?”

“...”

“.....”

“I mean.... are you surprised?”

Am I really getting made fun of by god? I die choking on a piece of pizza in my room, and now god makes fun of me. What the fuck?

“Look man, you made me!” My voice squeaked way too hard. “It’s your fault that’s my only skill, you’re the creator of all life, clearly it’s all your fault.”

“I am the creator, but I’m not the observer,” God said, clearly annoyed by my response. “Do you really think I just spend my days watching you every day?”

God is kind’ve a dick.

“I heard that, and I’m not a dick I’m just asking a question.”

Shit. God can read my thoughts.

“Well, I did make you didn’t I?”

He knows I think his new life+ system is just a god of war ripoff.

“Yes I do.”

Fuck me.

“Pretty sure that’s against the rules.”

“All right fine God, you win.”

“I won?”

“Yeah yeah, quit rubbing it in I’ll do your new life+ feature.”

“So you want to start off your life as a boy who’s only real talent, is that he’s good at masturbating?”

I told you God was a dick.
