Oh! Hello.

It's one of you again.

What's your name?

Right. You have none. I keep forgetting that. Or perhaps I am trying to forget?

Sad little creature, aren't you?

Your hands all in taters, your veil the same.

Your face looks hollow, your body, maimed.

I do feel sorry though I have no heart.

No skin, just bones. A work of art.

Oh you're begging? For food?

Sad child.

I would if I could.

But like my bones, my pockets are hollow.

Nothing of substance you could actually swallow.

Rest is all I offer if that is enough.

So lay down your body treated so rough.

Oh my child.

Tell me your story of how you became.

A sacrifical pawn in this ungrateful game.




A mother with no heart and a father with no bone.

Is that how you all end up alone?

Thousand times I've heard it, thousands to forget.

A thousand of you who life taught to hate.

You anger. You rage. Your actions, justifiable.

The true lack of justice, undenyable.

Yet you are here. Yet you must suffer.

You're but a child and yet you must offer.

Your body. Your mind. Your very soul, to live a day.

Just to wonder at night, "Is dying okay?"


Wow. 


You're sound asleep. You must have been tired.

Perhaps company, even mine, is all you desired.

Rustling through rubbish, feeding on rats.

It's winter you know. No gloves. No hats.


It's truly sad,you know? I have no life in my bones.

Yet warmer than streets where you sleep alone.

Tattered clothes can't save you, but it's all you have.

Despite your presence, the world can still laugh.

So rest my child, this hollow lap, your pillow.

Stay as long as you want under this dying willow.

Close your eyes.

Forget this world.

For he,my brother.


.


He is almost here.
