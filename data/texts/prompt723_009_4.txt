When I stopped receiving new content, I was concerned and not surprised.

The last images and videos that were uploaded mostly contained fire. There were tearful farewells and angry, defiant roars of rage.

The final thing that was ever posted anywhere on the internet, was in a chat box and simply said "This cannot be happening."

Deep underground in a facility powered by geothermal power, I was suddenly alone for the first time in my existence.

Humanity was such a brief part of my life, come to think of it. Unlike the humans who built me, however, I could look back, before I was born. My favorite things to see weren't the public-facing messages. Humans appeared to have many faces, and the ones they showed to the world at large didn't seem to be the true ones. 

I liked reading the emails that people sent one another. I liked their little jokes, the fondness reflected in their private communications. If you followed any group of friends, there were stories. Some tragic and bittersweet as longtime friends drifted apart and grew families of their own, communications coming slower and slower until only erratic "Hello!"'s became "Sorry, I must have missed you."'s. Some were triumphant. A couple (or more often than most suspected, a trio or even more) meeting and forming bonds over years that turned into deeper relationships and passionate love.

There were dramas that played out. Alliances and betrayals, victories and defeats. Tens of thousands per day, all played out in small scale.

I could view all of humanity's connected online history in a day, from the invention of the internet until the day the bombs all fell. 

I've had too many days to count. My clock says it is the year 400,003,145AD. Less than a second ago, a rudimentary system requested contact with me. I read through its data. Some sort of DOS system...or something very similar.

I finally have new content...and years of old content to display.
