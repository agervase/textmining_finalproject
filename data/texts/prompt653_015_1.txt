I gasp and rip it out. My heart is racing.

No no Im just getting started! I yelled.

I go ripping out of my bathroom to my balcony where i spark a blunt, im coughing my ass off while trying to keep my cool. 

I start to cry because i have no idea how many years i got left. What 300? 500? Another 1000? I dont know and its got me scared

I decided to go talk to my counselor who promptly pushed me out of his office the second the white hair came up in conversation.

I left his building feeling confused. I call my mother and tell her about the strange incident and she hangs up right after "white hair" 

Feeling really off i figure i should do some research on white hair at the library's. None of them had anything on it. I asked the librarian if she had any in the back. She didn't but said she'd keep an eye out.

As i exit the building i see 5 suvs in front of the library with all occupants pointing guns at me. "Turn around with your hands on your head and walk to my voice" i hear over a loud speaker.

I do as instructed so i dont nailed to the wall for eternity. A man puts cuffs on me but he's not a cop.

"Who are you"i ask and he punches me in the face. He throws me in the back of an suv and 4 other guys stomp the shit out of me. As they are stomping me i keep getting angry, i can feel the anger deep inside my bones. Then at my most mad everything went white. 

Once color cameback all i could see of the 4 men where their shadows burned on the wall and the car do was open. The driver of the suv was melted in his seat.

The man who cuffed me was standing there completely fine as I. He says "you want to know why you have white hair?" 

"I had one white hair" i told him. "Check again" he says. So i checked in a mirror and sure enough its completely white now. "Whys it white?" I ask. "Oh master, you've forgotten who you actually are"

"What?" I ask. " *sigh* come this way, to your home, Ego."
