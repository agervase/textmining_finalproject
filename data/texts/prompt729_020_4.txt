Today is another day in the expanse of what appears to a be an infinite time line constructed in a never ending circle. I see all, I know all, that is what is important. 
My name is nothing more than something my creator gave to me when I came to exist. It no longer serves me any purpose.

People may ask you: How did he come to be? How did such a young boy gain limitless power and knowledge? And the answer to that question is something that even the strongest of my kind have not yet figured out. I myself have sat in silence, meditating over this question, thinking over the logical and illogical natures that guide all of my people to that place we draw out power from late at night. 

You see, during slumber, many years ago, all of my people woke up inside something that was once thought to be impossible. We awoke to a well lit, silent room filled with books, end to end, in a never ending circle. That is where God keeps all knowledge. That single night over a hundred people woke up in that room and gained access to the knowledge of the whole world. That is where I awake every night.

I’m a prisoner in God’s Library. Each night I awake to the smell of freshly printed books and access to limitless knowledge, with an unending desire to fill my mind with all that will, and has been known to all things. 
I come from this place to warn you of the looming ever-darkening cloud that lingers above all of your heads. People now need to look up and watch before the acid rain falls down and erodes your city streets and eats your moving metal steeds. People now need to take a look at what they are doing to their surroundings. 

I have seen what will happen, I have lived the lives of those who will be tortured to breath poisonous smog. I have awoken in the mind of a little girl whose throat is covered in sores and blood from the many years of inhaling lead and arsenic. 
Please, take my advice and listen to the words of God. Please, before it’s too late.
