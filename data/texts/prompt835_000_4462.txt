“Hey, remember me? Britain, 1800’s?”

&#x200B;

She was a young-looking woman, with intelligent, bright blue eyes and short brown hair. I stared at her, squinting. I took another swig of my drink and shrugged.

&#x200B;

“Dunno what you’re on about, kid. You don’t look like you’ve seen a year before 1990,” I pressed my lips together.

&#x200B;

“Just before the War of 1812, I think,” she said, ignoring me. “I had longer hair back then. I remember because you had this ridiculous hat on, and had these piercing eyes. You just sat there and watched my friend and I dance for hours. My friend thought you were pretty cute, and wasn’t so sure why you didn’t approach us,” she pressed, tapping a finger against her own cheek. I gave a hefty sigh, and turned to face her. 

&#x200B;

“You keep going around saying things like that and people are gonna think you’re crazy.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, certainly. But you’re not people, are you? Otherwise I think you would’ve left by now.” She seemed proud – her chest puffed out and one knee folded over the other, like she had just won.

&#x200B;

“This is the best seat in the bar, and I’m not one to turn away a pretty lady when she talks to me,” I responded with a huff, turning my gaze away from her once more. “But, maybe, just this once I might suggest you find somewhere else to sit, kid.” I saw her frown in the corner of my eye. There was a long pause, and she shifted.

&#x200B;

“I don’t quite understand your resistance,” she finally said, losing confidence. Her voice quieted to a whisper. “We’re both immortal – this is amazing! I’ve never met someone else like this. We can be partners – finally, someone to talk to about all these things… we don’t have to be alone anymore.” I heard a crack in her voice – she had lost someone recently. Foolish. “And why do you keep calling me kid? We both know our appearances aren’t our real age, or we’d both be disgusting!” My jaw clenched.

&#x200B;

“So, what, do you think this is some sort of fairytale? Just because you and I are immortal, we must spend our whole lives together? I’m sure you’ve thought this all through. After all, our lives are so tragic - we both have watched all of our friends die again and again. We don’t want to let ourselves get hurt. But now we don’t have to. Right? That’s what you’re thinking?” I pressed, narrowing my eyes. She gave a small, scared nod. Her eyes watered.

&#x200B;

“Try again, kid. I reckon you aren’t that old yet – what, a couple hundred years? I give you maximum a thousand.” I raised an eyebrow. She didn’t argue – I saw her open her mouth, then shut it. “I’ve been around for longer than this race has. I’ve sat and watched empires rise with my morning coffee, then seen them fall with my afternoon tea. You, young girl, are hardly of interest to me. I, contrary to popular belief, am pleasantly happy on my own. You’ll learn to be soon enough.” I get to my feet. 

&#x200B;

“Word of advice, kid. We are observers. So, stop getting involved, get out of my face, and enjoy the god damned scenery.”
