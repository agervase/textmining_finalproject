We, the awestruck faction members, stood around him. We saw a man, once glorious and proud, withering away under the green glow of fluorescent hospital lights. The man who vanquished the great beast of Velenforth, with nothing but an iron sword. The same man who bested countless foul creatures, who looted and explored more of the 9 realms than any man before him, now knocked on the door of death. Grog the Plunderer was his name.  

In one last act of willpower and defiance Grog raised his fist in the air. A thin and shaking pillar of lost strength. For a moment he felt as if his Hospital gown turned into the glistening plate that protected him from so many a foe. His grey hands were once again filled with blood, color and youth.

He slipped away just then, clinging to the glory of his younger days.

The "faction members" paid their respects and went back to work. One mopped the floors in the hall, the other went back to the front desk, and the third put his scrubs back on for a long night shift. 

The MMO had taken over the lives of so many that acting like faction members was part of the everyday routine. When the old and frail became too weak to take the stress of the video game they came back to reality lost and delusional. The world they had spent years of their time in was out of reach. 

It would be too unsettling for them to live the lives of warriors, champions, and mages just to come back to reality and die the death of a meager old RPG gamer. 

So we, the faction members, would come in every night. Dressed as squires, mail clad warriors and bards. To give the life long gamers the send off that they so proudly earned in game.

I pulled out my pen. Time to make it official. 
*time of death- 8:12 PM, August 3rd, 2043.*
