"Oi, remember me? Britain, 1800s?"

"No."

"Aw, come on now. Don't be like that. We spent a whole bloody week together! Running to and fro hitting every bank in the south! It was a good time!"

"It was... I was going through... I don't, don't get up to that sort of thing anymore, and I'd like to leave it behind me."

"Like fuck I'm taking that for an answer! I thought we were friends!"

"It's been 200 fucking years, man."

"Well I thought you were dead! Didn't fucking know you'd also live forever! How many immortals you meet every day? Di'n't even figure I was one til around 1920."

"That's... an extraordinarily long time to not realize something like that."

"Yeah, well I thought I just got good genes."

"Genes where, at the age of... how old *are* you?

"I was born 'round 1796 or so."

"And it took you until you were 124, with the body of a 30-year-old man, to realize that you might--"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well we didn't have the modern sciences, I thought I was just lucky.  Blagh. How the hell old were you when you figured it out?"

"I was around 55 when I became suspicious. 70 when I knew something was definitely off. I can't remember a single moment where I simply acknowledged being immortal... so perhaps around now."

"Well. You's got the sciences to figure it out these days, you're probably a lot younger, haven't seen as much."

"I was born in what I guess you'd now refer to as Classical Greece."

"What year?"

"A specific year? I guess nowadays it would be called.... gimme a sec, gotta do the math... 428 BC."

"Oh, bugger off."

"I cry every time I think about where we could be today if we didn't lose so much... I remember... the Library of Alexandria.... and, when the ink of all the books of Baghdad dyed the river black... the Bonfire of the Vanities... even as recently as Nazi Germany! Such a shame... I've often thought of writing things down, but... what use would it be? Nobody would believe a word I say. I couldn't even forge a contemporary account because of carbon-dating. If I wrote it all down... it would only be useful to me. And I already kn-- oh, he's gone. Well, all right. Chaire, then."
