The battle was frozen around me, the fletching of the bolt that should have killed protruded through my cuirass, the head rested against my heart. It did not concern me. I held my sword behind me, blocking the blow I truly feared.

"I've been waiting for you," I said, turning to face my attacker.

Death looked nothing like I had expected.

I *had* expected a hooded figure in black robes, skeletal hands gripping a tall scythe.

Instead, I say a tall, dark-skinned figure clothed in cloth of purest white. His hair was wild, as was his beard. His eyes shone brightly with a surprise I might almost call pleasant. But he wasn't done surprising me yet.

"My child, where did you ever learn such a thing!"

While I had expected Death to be silent, to be sure,  I had not thought it impossible that he might speak. I certainly had *not*, however, expect such a jovial tone from the being so many called the *Grim* Reaper.

I was dumbstruck.

"Well don't just stand there looking surprised! It is *I* who gets to be surprised. I have been cleaving souls from their flesh for \*millennia--\*from your perspective, at least. Never have I had a mortal twist away my blow!"

I raised my blade into a guard I had learned during my years in the Orient.

"Ahh, *Ko Gasumi No Kamae*," he said in perfect Japanese, "I know it well! I have seen it fail *many* times. But I am less interested in your technique than I am in your *focus*. No mortal could have taught you to perceive me coming." He gestured at the frozen forms around us, the spurts of blood hanging in the air, the dust floating motionless all around. His face fell.

"Ahh." Somehow the disappointment in is tone struck me deep. "I see. *Someone* has made a deal with an *angelus lapsus*." He looked at me with pity, which made my blood boil.

"They gave me the power to resist you, and I intend to use it. I *will* be king, and no one, mortal or otherwise, will stop me!" I lunged at Death before he could even move. I brought my blade down hard on the nape of his neck. To my surprise, my blade bounced back as if I had brought it down on a boulder. Pain shot through my arms and I recoiled into a new guard.

"Oh my child." Death shook his head. "They can give you power to resist me, but they cannot give you power *over* me. You can have no power over me unless it is given to you from *above*, not below."

My surprise betrayed me, and Death chuckled.

"Are you really so stunned? Of *course* they lied to you! Have you not heard the one they serve called *The Prince* *of Lies*? Oh my child," he shook his head "this is a bargain you will long regret."

"Enough talk!" I bellowed in the face of Death. "If you want my soul, then come and take it."

"Why? You have bargained for the power to deflect my blows. I have better things to do than dance with you. There are others who need me."

With that I felt the bolt sink into my heart. The figures around me began to move again, and I spun and fell to the dust. I could not move. I lay there, still, as the battle raged all around.

My brother appeared over me, shaking me hard but to no avail.

"Damon! *DAMON!*"

He grabbed me behind my arms and dragged me away from the fray. Though I could not open my eyes, I saw Death clearly. A man a few yards in front of me missed his parry. As the spearpoint touched his throat time froze again.

Death strode over to the man and, swinging his sword high, brought it down upon the doomed warrior. The blade passed harmlessly through the man's body, but in a moment his soul stepped out of its earthly form. The spirit looked around with a look of profound bewilderment. But when his eyes fell on death, a look of serene understanding came over him

"Come, my child," Death said, "it is time for you to rest." He held his arms open wide and the man embraced him like a friend.

Dread washed over me. What had the demon promised? *Death shall not be able to take you*. All of a sudden I understood.

"WAIT," I yelled, "WAIT! TAKE ME! I won't resist!"

Death looked over at me, his smile turning to sadness.

"Excuse me," Death said to the spirit in his arms, "I must speak to this man. Just walk into the light. They are waiting for you."

The spirit looked off to his left and, with a final smile at Death, turned and vanished. Whatever light he could see, I could not.

Death strode over and knelt beside me. He put his hand on my helmet. I could see tears in his eyes.

"I cannot, my child. I have no power to free your soul. Don't you understand? You've been tricked."

I sobbed.

"You mean to tell me I am bound to my corpse *forever*?"

"Forever? No. Until the end of the age, until Judgment? Yes."
