It had been happening for 5 years now...and honestly I was so used to it I had started wearing elbow and knee pads on my way to work. You know the ones that mothers give to their kids before they ride a bike or a skateboard for the first time. That $20 set of pads had protected countless suits and pants. It was always a different person, from a different angle, at a different time during my commute. For the first year, I had tried to expect the attacks, but after it seemed like it would be impossible; I decided to just prepare for them.

It was my 23 birthday today! I woke up just like any other day: got dressed, put on my pads, and was putting on my shoes when one of the strings broke. Great. Luckily, I had another pair. I finally headed out the door, down the first step...and that's when I saw it coming. A man was running down the street periodically checking his watching and running faster each time, he seemed to be wearing some sort of suit that blended with the surroundings behind him. But that couldn't be possible. As I tried to focus on him it seemed to be harder to see him. I quickly turned my head forward, looking straight ahead, I could see him more clearly now with my peripheral vision. I knew I had to play this carefully. I kept walking down the stairs planning to jump back behind my gate as soon as he leaps for me. He was about five steps away. Now four. Now three. I scrambled backwards as I heard a shout noooooooo. 

I looked around, but the man was gone.

I thought "finally, I am free."

And then I saw him, standing there with a face not unlike the one that had stared back at me that very morning in my mirror. 

He sais....I said, "I have been protecting you for five years now, from countries, freelancers, lunatics, and non-believers. But what they don't realize, what they can't realize, is that I already expected this."
