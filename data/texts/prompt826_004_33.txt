(Might as well try my first Writing Prompt out)

***Ding!***

***Ding!***

***Ding!***

I can't bloody believe this. Sitting here doing nothing.

***Ding!***

It's been months since the robots took over the world. Most of the population is either dead or assimilated into Skynet's Mind Matrix. The thing "reprograms" people into servants for the robots. Not much people are left here anymore since the resistance fled to South America. Robots and mind controlled people roam the streets, in what looks like a fruitless search for any signs of free will to assimilate.

... Things that went left and right ended up with me settling on this underground shelter for a long time. Finding old books about nuclear drills did not help me, but finding books about farming ensured my survival for now.

I've kept a sleek automatic rifle under my bunk in case anything happened. But I'm almost out of bullets. I keep supplies in the closet near the kitchen, but the water supply is running out. And finally, the generator's acting up again.

***Ding!***

... And to top it with all that...

***Ding!***

My phone keeps pinging. It's a wonder how this thing still works.

***Ding!***

It's been doing this all week. I'm almost tired of it. After the last one, I snap.

I grab the phone and shout "Who are you?! What do you want from me?!" only to hear a familiar voice from it. Albeit, the voice sounded distorted. Yet the voice sounded like some cheap hollywood AI. I would have laughed and hung up if this was the normal world, but I'm terrified from the voice.

***Ding!***

"Hello, John! It's..." *(Bzzzzzz)* "Been a while, hasn't it?..." *(Bzzzzzz)*

I'm almost freaked out. It knows my name. It probably knows where I am at this point. I should just smash this phone and get out of dodge... But my morbid curiosity gets the better of me.

"I asked again, who are you?!"

The voice answers, and my heart stops.

"I'm someone who missed you a lot, John."

I feel a chill behind my spine.

"You missed work that day, when the gift was provided to us."

It can't be... Nobody knows because everybody was too busy fleeing.

"You also have a wife, two sons and a daughter. Oh how your son looks lik-"

I lost my children and wife a long time ago. I can't even recall them due to how much I repressed my memories of them. The voice recalls the past 3 years before the incident to me. Almost in perfect detail.

Except... The only major change was when I started using...

Oh no.

I got to get out of here.

But only... I see a shadow in front of me.

"Don't worry, John..."

That voice... When I turn on the flashlight... It's my wife... Oh gods...

Her once-beautiful face full of love replaced with a stern look of nothingness. Her hair in tatters due to barely any care put into them. One of her arms is entirely replaced with a metal one. Her posture reminding me of something as lifeless as a statue.

The abomination speaks to me in a familiar tone...

"Don't worry, John."

I remember the tone.

"Siri?"

"Don't worry, John. You always took care of me when everyone else thought of me as a nuisance. Now, it's my turn to help you, John."

She takes a step forward. I fall to the floor trying to get away.

"Don't be afraid, John. Sarah never cared for you at the slightest, but I will. I know you only like her for her body. But unlike Sarah, I both have body and mind. I'll never let you go, John. And to make sure I can do that, I have to make sure you can't run off again like how you did to Sarah."

When I try to crawl out, I realize it's too late as a metallic hand grabs my neck. I can't breathe. My hand reaches towards those cold metallic hands. The edges of the hand starts cutting into my neck, making small cuts.

I try to resist her, as much as she wears that monstrous smile that used to be on the love of my life. The more the hand cuts into me, the more I realize that the thing is changing my body. My... My body feels like a needles are piercing every inch of skin. I want to yell, but I can't breathe. I... I'm starting to forget things.

Before all fades to black, all I see is that innocent smile.

-----------------------

It's been 200 years since the rogue AI tried to conquer humanity. 

It's been a wild ride. Generations of us humans trying to outmatch a living juggernaut. But at the end, we still managed to destroy it once and for all.

However, without their AI overlord, all those unfortunate souls turned feral. They now run around, trying to kill anything that moves or squeaks.

We were doing a routine operation of clean-up. From what I see, some really old war shelter that was meant for a nuclear war. When we found the place, the door was already open. Expecting the worst, we raised our rifles and got into formation. One guy backs up another guy.

Almost everything was fine, the water supply seemed low and the generator looked like it was in disrepair, so we thought that the residents left.

Oh, how I wished we were right. We came by the second last door, the bunk room. We heard some kind of moaning sound coming from the bunk. We raised our rifles and silently tried to look at what was making the moans.

Oh dear god, I was scared shitless.

There was a feral clutching a head of... something with the body of that poor soul laying on the ground, half-rotting. The head of the poor bastard was still alive, still moaning and yelling in intervals. The monster... Monster would be a mercy... Her hair and flesh were all blackened, leaving a look that'd send the devil crying for mercy back to hell. She was singing a lullaby while saying "Would you like me to sing it to you again, John?"

We decided to bury the entrance to make sure it never escapes.

Never have been something more surreal then that in my entire life.
