Henry was ashamed.

On what should have been the best day of Henry's life, standing before his peers in Geneva, holding the highest honor the scientific community can bestow on one of its own, Henry felt nothing but shame. He wanted to curl up under a blanket and never be seen in public life again. 

The presenter, Jörgen Karlson, held the prized pendant in a red velvet box and offered it to Henry. The mere sight of the thing, of Alfred Nobel's embossed face, filled Henry with hot self-loathing. 

Gingerly, as if it were a live scorpion, his false smile locked in place by force of habit, Henry took the gold pendant in his fingers. It was cool to the touch and much heavier than he anticipated. 

Jörgen politely left the stage and slowly the applause died down, leaving Henry to bob in the silence like a corpse at sea. Henry had prepared a speech of course. It was folded up inside the front pocket of his jacket, where it felt as though it were a searing hot coal against his heart. 

Henry shut his eyes and when he opened them he allowed himself to speak from the soul.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you a brief story. When I failed to graduate high school and dropped out of all forms of childhood education, I was desperate for work."

What was he *doing*? Henry continued.

"One such job was at a local poultry farm. The working conditions were horrendous and the poor creatures lived in cramped cages all their lives. It was terrible work and I despised it. 

"But before I quit, something extraordinary happened. I met a chicken."

The audience chuckled at that. Henry swallowed a lump and continued.

"An incredible chicken. A chicken like no other chicken which has ever lived. A chicken which could *speak*. Actually *speak* english."

That shut everyone up. Henry was knee deep now, no turning back.

"I could not leave this chicken to its fate, and so I stole it from the poultry farm on my last day and brought it home with me. I nursed it back to life and, in return it gave me not only the secrets of the universe, but friendship."

A pin dropped in the room right then would have been heard across the hall. 

"You see, my friends, it is not I who solved the conundrum of fusion energy, nor I who paved the road to the stars. I am a nobody! A high school drop out, who never even attended college, let alone received a PHD! I know as much about math and physics as I do interpretative dance. I have never completed a formula in my *life!*"

As Henry began to rant, a man in the front row, one of his close associates, worriedly took out a small notepad and scanned it for some piece of information. Confirming his suspicions, the man began to race up onto the stage. Henry raged on, his voice rising. 

"No friends! I am a mere imbecile! I do not deserve this fine reward! The true source of my knowledge, the true savior of the human race, is none other than my mathemachicken!"

Henry's associate made it to Henry on stage and tried to explain what he had read in the notebook, but Henry was not having any of it. He pushed the young assistant away and  grabbed the thin microphone with both hands, the veins in his neck pulsating visibly as he went into a apoplectic furor. 

"You all think *I* did this? A mere *mortal*?! *Prometheus* robbed the God's of their fire! *I* am no Prometheus. *I* am no Prometheus!"

The young man returned, this time with two security guards. There were gasps from the audience as the two guards moved to restrain Henry. He fought back as best he could, tearing his tuxedo under the right arm pit, frothing at the mouth, and eventually had to be sedated by force. As he slowly lost consciousness, Henry could be heard mumbling to himself. 

"I am no Prometheus. Mathemachicken stole the God's fire. Mathemachicken..."

At last, Henry passed out. Jörgen came back onto the stage and tried to put the audience at ease, his palms outstretched toward them, his face full of sadness. The room rumbled with whispers as Henry was slowly placed onto a stretcher and marched out to a waiting ambulance.

When at last Henry was out of the building, Jörgen stood stoically at the pedestal. Seeing Henry's Nobel prize on the floor, Jörgen picked it up and looked at it, tears in his eyes.  Finally, he spoke.

"It pains me, as I know it pains all of you, to see a mind so great suffer so greatly. Like so many in this room, Henry has touched *my* life, both personally and professionally. Even at university, even as he broke new ground in every field he set his astounding mind to, he always walked the razor's edge of madness. Perhaps it is precisely in that tension where true genius is to be found. It has certainly been the case for our most esteemed colleague, Henry Caster."

Jörgen paused, holding back a sob. 

"Now I hope you will join me in a moment of silence for our dear friend, and peerless colleague, as he goes through this trying ordeal."

The room went silent for a long time.
