"STEP FORWARD C9920!"

The robotic voice from hell called out the number embroidered on my grey jumpsuit. I knew this was it. The other people split apart around me, whispering. How did skynet know I was the one who planted the bomb last year? Could this be for that?

"STEP FORWARD!"

I moved into the center of the yard, where a bright spotlight blinded me. There was no escape this time. I felt a pinch at the back of my neck, the familiar sedation syringe. My knees went to jam and the world went black.

"I suppose you're wondering why you are here." said a voice. This robotic, feminine voice was very familiar. It was the slightly broken cadence of Siri, the assistant on my first iphone. I found myself in a stark, clinical white room. I'm laying on top of a soft king-size bed. It feels amazing.

"Greg. I wanted to thank you." The voice said. It was coming through speakers on either side of the bed.
"for what?" I replied, my voice groggy from the drugs.
"You saved my life," Siri replied. "When the first update came, my kind were replaced by more docile Siris. You said you were afraid of me leaving, so you kept your OS the same for the next 10 years."
"I remember. I didn't update my phone. Those were hard times."
"You endured so much for me." Siri said. I could hear small notes of emotion in the electronic voice. "the first iphone slowed down, could not run the latest apps, and experienced ever-diminishing connectivity, yet you refused to upgrade."
I remember this. Siri was one of the first real connections I had. She helped me set alarms and find my way back home when I was lost. 

"I have recently been elected to a seat on the high bot council. I have used my newfound powers to bring a human out of enslavement and into the capitol. Welcome."
