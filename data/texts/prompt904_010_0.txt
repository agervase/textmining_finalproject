I didn't, but I upvote anyway because I'm a redditor and like conformity within the Reddit world. 

I then go comment on a few Bernie Sanders related posts because he's an absolute angel. Now that I'm feeling all sad inside at how we don't live in a democratic socialist utopia, I realize I'm nowhere even close to being where I want in life. After I have a quadruple espresso shot late, I get to work preparing my anti-trump protest material. I call a friend and see if he wants to join, but unfortunately he was too busy updating his resume and taking a couple of classes related to his career goals. I think to myself, "Does he not care about his future?"

Fast forward a couple of hours and I'm standing outside the Trump Tower in the cold New York weather, raising my reclaimed wood picket sign into the air. It reads, "Not My President", even though in fact, he is. 

Suddenly... I wake up... it was just a dream... a day dream...

I hear yelling, it was my manager.

"James!!! What the hell are you doing? We don't pay you to stare off into space, get back to work! Oh, and don't forget to put your beard net on, we don't want your hair in the deep frier like last time!"

I snap out of it, and get back to work. I begin telling all of my coworkers about my awesome day dream, and about the awesome man I was, and the man I wish to become. 

However, I was cut short - there was a customer. It was a van full of young bearded individuals stoned out of their minds. As I was handing over their gigantic order out of the drive through window, an order that must have cost $50.00, I noticed they had Bernie shirts on. I complimented them and wished them a good night, and thanked them for visiting the establishment I work at. The pinnacle of American Capitalism: McDonalds.
