Dan is simple. 

He is 26, with a small apartment and a dead end job. He has no family left, and no career prospects, and he is satisfied with being alone. 

Dan is plain. 

He has no significant other, and while he does pine after some colleagues and friends, the crush is temporary and he is satisfied with being alone. 

Dan hates nothing and likes most things. 

He's never been bullied, but he's never had a close group of friends before. People's gaze seem to sweep over him and simply not see him, and Dan is satisfied with being alone. 

Dan is utterly, perfectly and wholly unremarkable.

But despite all that, Dan is *hungry*. 

---

Dan's routine is easy to follow and easy to remember. He wakes up at six, goes for a short run, feeds the birds just outside his apartment complex and goes back home. He takes a shower, and has breakfast at precisely eight-thirty. He leaves his complex at nine and takes the bus number five-six-six. It takes exactly four stops until he can see the small grocery store he works at, and he always sees the owner busily sweeping the pavement and setting up tables. He always smiles serenly, even as his stomach growls and clenches in hunger. 

Everything is simple. Easy.

But Dan wakes up today with deep seated pain, an ache that he doesn't know how to describe. His bones hurt, his teeth hurt, his *face* hurts. He grasps at his abdomen with shaking hands, and feels something hard beneath the skin. He presses against it and flinches at the throb that goes through his entire body. It thrums, vibrating along his nerves like a wave of water and he gasps, feeling submerged into something he cannot define. He attempts to stand up, but his limbs are sluggish and slow, and he feels unwelcome in his own body, like a rope stretched too far. His skin is taut and feverish, but Dan stands anyway. He's got to follow his routine. He **has** to follow his routine. He stumbles along, feet dragging like anchors set into sand and he feels like a spectator to a game that has not yet even begun. A knocking on his door interrupts his slow shamble to the bathroom, and as the loud thuds against the wood continue, Dan feels more and more like an *other*.

"Mr Peterson!"

The voice is loud and shrill and Dan is dimmly aware that it belongs to his landlady. "Mr Peterson! You still haven't paid rent this month! Nor last months actually!" The knocking has not subsided and Dan runs a hand along the frame of the door. Each thud of hand against wood seems to steal away a piece of him, and Dan feels less like himself each moment. His routine, he remembers vaguely, is important, but he is *so hungry*. Wooden chips fall away, and he finally reaches the door handle, slowly opening it. He barely recognizes her, but her face is flushed and vaguely familiar. Spittle flies from her open mouth as she continues to shout, not even having noticed the opening of the door.

"For the love of go-"

Her voice cuts out, as she stares at him in abject horror. Dan feels as if he should be offended, but he is so, so hungry and cant focus on much else. His thoughts drip like tar, and he again feels that ache deepen. 

"What, what... what **are** you?!" The person before him shriekes, and he tilts his head. He is himself, is he not? His name is... He's pretty sure he has a name. The figure trembles and slides to the floor, knees obviously gone weak and he can faintly smell piss. Saliva is gathering in his mouth and he opens it just enough for some of the liquid to spill out. It's black and gooey, dripping like syrup. The figure doesn't stand and he opens the door fully. His limbs are still slow, but they click and crunch as he looms over the prone figure. He's just so *hungry*.

He knows that he has a routine. 

He knows that he gets up at 6 o'clock in the morning, but now that he can't sleep anymore, he spends the time until then roaming the streets. He leaves a trail of inky black liquid behind him, always in search of something to eat. He can't run anymore, but he will never need to run again. His *click-clacking* echoes through the dark night and he shambles along, unaware of the black mist trailing behind him. 

He knows that he feeds some... animals? in the mornings. But even as he looks around, slow gaze sweeping the fountain, he cannot spot a living thing. The hunger has abated for a moment though, and he is satisfied with that. Maybe if he comes back another time, they will be here and he will be able to follow his routine. 

He knows that he has to return to the building and do *something* before heading out again. What was it? Eat? Water? He cannot remember. But he shuffles along, the sun just peaking over the horizon. He hisses and shuffles faster, taking each step slowly and carefully. He can hear sounds coming from above, as doors are opened and people - *food* - go about with their day. His stomach rumbles again and he is stricken with pain so deep that he cannot feel anything other than the need to consume. He wants to tear, devour and eat **e v e r y t h i n g**.

**THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ALERT. BARRICADE ALL ENTRIES TO YOUR HOUSE AND REMAIN INSIDE. WE REPEAT, REMAIN INSIDE AND DO NOT INITIATE CONTACT WITH OTHERS.**

The message repeats, often garbled and unrecognizable, but the sirens that accompany it are unmistakable. The sound echoes through the desolate neighborhood, a relic of a time when things were different. People are often surprised that they are still sending out the message since it's already been almost a year since the outbreak. Those that lived through the first appearance are scarce, but they often retell their experiences, spreading their stories through the remaining population. Not many people have seen one of the inky figures and lived, so those rare bits and pieces are valued beyond measure. They tell of horrific figures with gaping maws, and uneven limbs, glistening and shining like new tar; of the ominous *clicking* sounds they make as they twist their shapes into mockeries of a human figures. Some have forgotten humanity so completely, they only exist in one place, like static refusing to change. But they can't help it, they are just s o   h   u   n  g  r  y.

hey y'all! This was my first ever post in this subreddit and I haven't written for quite some time, so I'm pretty rusty. A really cool prompt though.
