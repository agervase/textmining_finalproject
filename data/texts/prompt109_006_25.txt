I'm at the carnival. It's one of my favorite episodes. That's what I call the different places. There are a lot of them. Sometimes they stop and vanish unexpectedly, and then another one begins. I don't know why.

"Come on, Tommy! Race you to the teacups!" a young boy with sandy brown hair and a missing tooth says to me. That's my brother Rick. We do everything together.

I haven't seen my parents in a while, but that's okay, I'll find them soon. We set a meeting place in case Rick and I get lost, but we aren't lost.

The carnival is fun because of the cotton candy, and the spinning tea cups that spin really really fast and stuff. I wish they would go faster.

The carnival. The beach. The playground. I like those ones. Sometimes there are bad ones. I don't like the airport. My brother Rick goes missing in that one, and I can't find him.

But right now I'm at the carnival, waiting in line with Rick for our turn on the spinning ride that looks like tea cups. There's a young girl in a blue dress waving me us in, and a little white rabbit also, and a really funny looking cat, and some old guy with crazy hair and a big hat.  I don't know why they are all there, but I don't really care.

"Go ahead, son," the ticket taker says to me as he takes my ticket.

Rick and I rush over to my favorite teacup, one that is green and has a 10/6 on it, but before I reach it there's a flash of white.

The carnival is gone. Faceless people in blue masks are looking down at me. There's strange sounds, beeping, voices.

"Congratulations, Dr. Agarwal," a woman says. "You did it."

I don't know which one is Dr. Agarwal, or what he did, but I want to go back to the carnival. I try to tell them this, but they don't listen. 

"Try to calm down Rick - er, Tommy," the man says to me. 

"Congratulations, Dr," another man says and pats the man that must be Dr. Agarwal on the back. "First ever transfer of consciousness from one person to another. Incredible!"
