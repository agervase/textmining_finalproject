"God dammit, Meredith, I told you it was a hoax! Didn't I tell you that!?" Collum was near doubled over, the usually tanned skin on his knuckles white from gripping the arms of the chair. Meredith glanced over the edge of the TV Guide for a moment to look at her husband. Milky clouds of cigarette smoke swirled around him as he thrashed around in his chair, assailing the indifferent anchorman on television with an endless barrage of insults and obscenities. 

For a moment, Meredith imagined her old Collum as an erupting volcano. For a moment, she wondered if he might suddenly lunge forward out of his dusty old chair and dive right through the television screen, and over the Channel 4 News Desk. "You did indeed tell me, Col." She said calmly, without lowering the magazine.

She hated when he got worked up like this. It was as if all the anger and pain radiated out of him at once, filling the house like a balloon. This time, it felt like she was suffocating. It felt like the balloon was about to pop. She peered once again over the edge of the magazine toward the tense, aging form of her husband. As he raised a shaking hand to his mouth and drew a long inhale from a cigarette, Meredith felt a somewhat unfamiliar--but distinct--impulse that she was catching her husband in a particularly vulnerable moment, and she quietly averted her gaze.

It had been such a difficult week already, and this moon business was just too much for old Collum. "I think I'll have some tea, Hon, what about you," Meredith cooed gently over her shoulder as she walked into the kitchen, "would you like anything?" 

-----------------------------------------

Losing a loved one is never easy. When you lose that person for a second time, you realize that the first time was not a loss, rather it was a forfeiture. And that forfeiture does nothing to ease the pain of the loss when it really comes.

Cameron was such a sweet boy, and he'd grown into a wonderful, bright young man, but when he brought James around to meet his parents... Collum--well, old Collum wasn't ready for that kind of news at that time. Meredith couldn't help but wonder if he'd be ready now. If only he could have accepted the son he'd loved so much, who gave him so much to be proud of, maybe things would be different. Maybe it didn't matter. Cameron was gone, and this time, Cameron was gone for good.

-------------------------------------------

Meredith poured a cup of tea and walked back into the den over to her husband. She sat on the arm of the chair into which Collum had slouched listlessly in a display of complete resignation. Meredith took her beloved husband's hand as they watched highlights from the National Memorial Service for their long-estranged son as it was replayed on Channel 4 News. A man named James Woodlawn, who stood alone at the podium, was finishing a eulogy.

*... and when Cameron told the team we were going to put a fleet of autonomous construction robots to work in space building the foundation for humanity's first Moon colony, even we thought it would be impossible. Now I see, as hard as it is in moments like this, what he told me so many times: Nothing is impossible.*

Meredith looked toward the front windows with a start as a loud car sped past the house suddenly. For a moment the headlights of the vehicle illuminated the dark, smoky den, and Meredith could see tears streaming down Collum's cheeks. She squeezed his hand a little tighter, and they silently continued to watch the news...

*... very sad day for America--really--for the planet today, Priya. But on a lighter note, we've got an update on the mysterious lowering of the American flag on the Moon! Our sources at NASA have confirmed that the American flag on the Moon was lowered, incidentally, to half mast--are you ready for this--by one of the machines that is part of the fleet of robots that we know is almost finished the historic task of building the foundation for humanity's first Moon colony. I guess when these robots started building, there was a slight miscalculation in the placement or something, and one of the machines crashed into the flag, that has been on the moon since July 1969, the last--and for now--only time a human being has stood on the moon. Now hopefully that record will be broken very soon, as the first team of 30 "Moon Colonists" is set to land on the moon in only 11 days...*
