"Oh, here is where my son was born. What an awful labor. I regretted being a mother the second I became one. I think his father never fully forgave him for ruining my vagina." 

I grimace and uncomfortably shift in the folding metal chair. Hell isn't what I pictured it to be. It reminds me of an awful waiting room full of odd smells and poor lighting.

I'm cut short establishing the scene when Doctor Sullivan's voice comes over the speaker. 

"Man, that kid has one bent dick."

You see, I had an accidental overdose when I was twenty-five. Cold medication and alcohol; what a stupid way to go. My parents thought it was suicide and even though I thought I was a pretty decent person, I still landed in hell. It seems more tame than that book by Dante.

As far as I can tell, I'm stuck on watching my life in full replay, not just the highlights.

I'm nine and I'm sleeping in the car, mom has a cigarette and a car is pulled up next to us. A seven year old peeks over.

"Cool Pok√©mon shirt. I like Charmander too." 

Well that's been the peak of the last few weeks.

I'm sixteen and I try to find how to turn on the subtitles over all the laughing.

Twenty now, this is suffering. I lose my virginity, It's not pretty, she is though. 

Never knew she pitied me that much.

Twenty-two and I'm working at a grocery store. I help an old man get something off the shelf, he was going to hang himself that day. Turns out the clever M.A.S.H reference I made brightened up his day.

Twenty-five, finally. I watch it all go down again, the T.V. room is full of demons that come and go.

I die in my sleep, peacefully. Eventually the paramedics come after a few days.
I'm sent to the morgue and prepared for my funeral. The director laughs.

"Man, that kid has one bent dick."
