//////Of course that didn’t hold true for her. If I had been there I would’ve made her promise, I could’ve saved her... 200 years ago I had a bullet in my chest, 186 years ago she had fatal car crash; for 200 years I’ve been a medical miracle; for 186 years I’ve had to live without her; 200 years ago, she saved me, 186 years ago, I failed her. And that’s haunted me ever since.  

Now it’s 2220, but I’m living in the past; I still look at her picture on my holi-projector, I still miss her quick-wit, I still haven’t moved on. Which isn’t to say I haven’t tried, she’s the only woman I ever loved and the only one who ever loved me. People don’t treat you the same when you’ve lived centuries longer than them; science has extended their lifespans but it can’t explain my unnaturally long experience on this earth. It’s hard to connect with others when  you could’ve gone to college with their great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother. It’s a bit off-putting I suppose; but it didn’t used to be this difficult... 

It was surprising at first, a shock but not headline news. The doctors, although unsure, chalked it up to the bullet missing the important arteries and organs. It was a while before they started noticing something was different, I looked the same 12 years later. When I asked just exactly what she had done she would smile and say: 
“What I needed to do” 
I never figured it out but I swore that one day I would save her,  I would do the same for her, I would’ve. 3 years later a drunk driver rammed into her car and killed her almost immediately. By the time I got the call it was too late, she was gone. And now, now I’m still here.
