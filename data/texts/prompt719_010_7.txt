Long time lurker, first ever story written blah blah blah....would appreciate any critiques! Thanks!


The sudden weight change that I felt in my leather bag confused me. I walked up the steps and felt inside the bag, and I felt something different, something that I have never felt before.  

Utter Fear. 

 The trigger felt wrong in my hands, and I forced myself to take my hands out of the bag and instead test the luck of my pockets for enough money to get me through this nightmare. I kept telling myself that as I soon as I got off the bus, I should be fine, I should be ok. I looked at the driver and what I saw threw away the little hope I had left to get through this shit.

As I looked, the man had reached under his seat to bring out a bottle of vodka, and set off to drink it as discreetly as possible. He did not notice me staring at him, and being the dumbass that I am, I paid for the ticket and sat down, forgetting about the handgun in my bag.   You could feel the bus swerving as the driver took off, and the periodic honk could be heard in the background. I got up for my stop and realized that this asshole was going too fast to stop at the red light in front of him. I knew what I had to do.  I yelled " STOP THE BUS ! " and pulled out my handgun and for whatever reason the driver, in his intoxicated state understood the threat and immediately pressed the brakes stopping inches away from the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen, gracefully walking across the crosswalk.

 I dropped my handgun and got off the bus tripping on all legs and all steps. I tripped over towards her, reached into my handbag, and pulled out a rose, one more beautiful than I have ever seen, and asked her, "What is your name?"  

She smiled.
