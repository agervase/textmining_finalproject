The first shots destroyed my bedroom window. I was surrounded by the black of Kevlar and gun metal. The smell of hot copper stung my nose. I instinctively fell to the ground and frantically squirmed under my bed. I couldn't see any more than black boots around my bed and I couldn't hear more than yells and rapid gunfire. I heard a man yell about a surge to the west and another to the south. More gunfire, more yelling, more confusion and panic! As the gunfire seemed to lull I wondered what they were shooting and why. Why am I being protected? Why my home? What did I do? Was I a part of some secret government project involving my absent family? Was I legion? 

The swat team members but one left my bedroom. From their voices I could tell they were looking for something. The one still in my room yelled to me "where's the baby!? We need to secure the baby!" I stared at him blankly... what baby?

He grabbed my arm and dragged me out from under the bed and stood me up. "Where's the baby?!" He yelled again. Seeing fear and anger in his eyes I stared to panic again. "I don't have a baby!" I yelled back, more of a scream. 

Another swat member entered my room behind me, "no baby, sir. And another surge is incoming". The man holding my by my arms shakes me and yells again "WHERES THE BABY!?" "I DONT KNOW!" "WHERES THE BABY!? THEYRE GOING TO KILL US ALL! WHERES THE BABY!!?"

"I DONT KNOW!!!!" I screamed and cried and soiled myself out of sheer panic. "I don't know I don't know I don't know..." I expected death, but I heard laughter. The men in black, the swat team surrounding me, were all laughing. 

The swat leader crouched down, smiled at me, pointed at my chest and said, "here's the baby"
