I called my superpower Professor Ex, because instead of communicating with me in a logical or timely way it waited until late at night when I was asleep to text me like it was six beers in. The shrinks said that I didn't *technically* meet the criteria for schizophrenia and the neurologist said he didn't see anything *too* concerning on the fMRI, so I started writing down Professor Ex's messages to see if I could figure out what or who the hell she was. Here are some of the excerpts from that notebook:

3/17/17: *"Kangaroos Have Three Vaginas."*  Looked it up upon waking; internet appears to confirm this. Thus far all factually demonstrable claims have been shown to be true. Not necessarily useful. Not necessarily tasteful. Just not demonstrably false.

...

4/19/17: "*Football Poses Significantly More Risk of Serious Injury to High School Athletes Than Other Sports Like Baseball or Swimming."* Add this to the mounting list of observations Professor Ex sends me that I didn't know. One or two of them might have been an accident or a factoid I had forgotten I knew, but it was too much of a pattern. Which means this can't all be a delusion. Hey...this actually gives me an idea...

...

4/20/17: "*James Randi shut down the running million dollar offer for anyone who could prove they have paranormal abilities."* Well, that killed that idea. I felt like my superpower making a special point of informing me that having a superpower could no longer get you rich was, well, kind of a bitch move.

...

4/25/17: No messages tonight, but son said he was thinking about trying out for the football team. Kid's a little insecure about being underweight. Told him that girls go more for guys with a lean, swimmer's over some hulking defensive lineman. No idea how true that is, just need him to buy it until try-outs are over with.

...

6/2/17: "*Your right front tire is flat."* Sure as hell was, and knowing that in advance kept me from being late to work, but it confirms my suspicion that these messages are tailored to me as opposed to some universal cosmic radio station my brain just happened to pick up.

...

9/14/17: *"Your dad's birthday is in four days."* I feel like the "*...and if I hadn't reminded you, you would have forgotten to send out his card again this year,"* was heavily implied.

...

10/30/17: *"Todd Gurly has a higher VPD than Le'Veon Bell."* Nice to see the Professor supports my fantasy football habit, although knowing this I feel a little conflicted about whether acting on it is cheating. I guess technically I could have looked this up for...myself...oh screw me, I've been an idiot! I got so hung up on the fact that The Professor kept telling me things I couldn't possibly have known that I overlooked the part where all her statements were something a person *could* know, like VPD scores, and not something they couldn't, like who would actually turn out to be the better pick.

This meant that by far the likeliest explanation was that Professor Ex wasn't God, or a mutant superpower. It was another human. Someone brilliant enough to invent the technology to hack another human's brain, who both loved and condescended to me enough to spend ours each day on elaborate research quests just to provide me with useful tips for navigating my life.

There were only two possible people. I knew what I had to do.

11/1/17:

I had some rather obvious reasons to suspect mom. She managed to convince all of her children well into their twenties that the reason she was paid a six-figure salary (she never did mention by whom) to attend all those emergency international  marine biology conferences was that women who spoke four languages, had advanced computer science degrees and were proficient in Krav Maga were underrepresented in the field. Elaborate games of subterfuge based on half-truths was right in her wheelhouse. I have to admit the reason I suspected my wife was slightly more abstract. As a practicing ophthalmologist, syndicated advice columnist, freelance forensics consultant and Emmy-nominated producer, brain-hacking mad scientist felt like the sort of box she hadn't quite gotten around to checking off yet.

I sent mom a key lime pie for her upcoming birthday. Mom hates key lime pie because she had some a long time ago during her bachelorette party before she got so drunk she threw up on a male stripper. I only know that because Aunt Shereen once got so drunk that she forgot to keep her promise never to repeat that story.

As for my wife, well, she's been on me a lot to either turn on the light when I have to take a leak at night or sit down on the toilet seat. I wasn't going to *intentionally* pee on the toilet seat, but I did leave a couple of drops of moisture on the seat to give that impression. I figure if I'm wrong I'll make it up to her later.

...

11/2/17 *"ALWAYS AIM FOR THE HEAD!"* Fuck. I was really hoping it *wasn't* my wife. Not sure what to do about it, but at least now I know.

...

11/4/17: "*Food and Wine Magazine ranks Flaky Pear, Chocolate Pecan and Georgia Peach as among the top-rated pies of all time."* Oh God, they're in on it together.

...

11/24/17: Well, that was a weird Thanksgiving, but at least they both came clean. Fun fact: I thought they implanted something in my brain. Turns out one of my mom's marine biology friends snuck into my house one night and implanted this microscopic LED array that my wife invented behind my eyelids. Programmed it to only activate during REM sleep, which was a clever touch. I found out most of the messages I had ever gotten that contained random vagina-related trivia came from mom, which was deeply confusing.  Then I asked them why it was that all the women in my life turned out to be supervillains. My mom looked at my daughter before looking back to me and said, "Well, not yet. We're working on it."
