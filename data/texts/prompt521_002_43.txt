*come on John, let's return to helping the poor by giving away all your lively possesions*

"How about no?"

*but helping poor poeple is important and good John*

"It is, but not when I, and my family ends up poor you jackass something something*

*That's not how you're supposed to talk to an angel John...or anyone for that matter, now, let's go and do voluntary work in New York, they need us there*

"An angel? More like an annoying little twat"

*John....*

"Can you just fuck off for a moment? I've been doing nothing but cleaning fucking the streets of LA for the last week and I wish to rest"

*Sigh.....verwell John, I will return tomorrow*

Holy shit that worked...think John think, this twat that's been invading your mind claims to be an angel, what caused this? Did I throw a plastic bottle into the wrong container?  Did I not donate enough money to the local soup kitchen? No...no..that's not important, how could I get rid of it? Excorsicm by a priest? Nah, the priest would either sing praise unto the lord when he tried it or bitch about not having any crosses in my house. Threaten it? With what? Suicide? Does it even care? 

Wait....what if it came to me because I did too many good deeds?  How many poeple can claim to donate to multiple charities, sort all trash, refuse to use any gasoline fuelled vehicle  with the exceptions of busses when really necessary, only buy meat from local farmers with open fields for the animals and still do voluntary work at homeless shelters and in nursing homes?

But in that case...how to get it to fuck off to wherever it came from?

"Oh shit...."

Next Day
------------------


*Okay John, let's get back to our good deee....*

This human, John, he was a particularly interesting one, eventough he claimed to be an atheist, he did more good to the world most believers nowadays thanks to him owning a large transport company based out of "L.A. docks", that's why I was send to aide him. Suprisingly tough, he did not welcome my presence, and it seems he snapped in one way or another

As I looked over his shoulder, I saw that we were in one of his warehouses, now filled to the brim with somekind of containers.

He was talking to some slightly brownish human, from the "Mexico" region.

As I looked around, I saw what was in these containers. And I cried out from shock and horror.

Each one it seemed, was filled with crates containing the human weapons knows as guns and packs of white powder, that were from my knowledge, most likely packs of cocaine.

*John...what have you done? What sin is this?*

"Oh, just a deal I've made with a Mexican cartel, thanks to me, they can now spread all of these wares of theirs, across the US mainland, easy really, just a couple phone calls and some favors and ta-daaa"

*but John...why? You just destroyed many innocent lives!*

"Well, I thought that changing things up may be good for my health"

*Wha....what?*

"Like, you know, repetition and all being bad for you...."

*noo....nooo....you were supposed to be one of the best....*

"That's nice"

*I am...I am leaving John.....*

"Okay, bye, tell god to maybe ramp up Ebola, I hate seeing amateur work"

This is madness....utter madness, one of the "best" humans out there....just became one of the worst at a whim...Gabriel was right....humans are  all despicable...

Back the warehouse

Aaannnddd he's gone......but will he be back? Hopefully he is gone for real, it's not common that a filming studio is looking for a warehouse to fill with props for a movie about cartels......
