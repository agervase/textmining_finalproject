The daily grind, thirty years of it. I love my job, don't get me wrong, but it's exhausting. In my first few years I kept a tally of how many families I reunited, and how many ended up murder statistics. I'm good at my job, great even. Earl Riley, maybe you've seen my name on some obscure Wikipedia article about found missing people. 

On any normal day, my routine is my routine. Swing in the office at  a leisurely 8:03, sign in at 8:04, since the clock counts in five minutes. Boot up the computer, look at any folders left on my desk from the previous shift, bin any TPS reports, check my emails. Around 9, I'll properly start my work. So I'll get up and go to the toilet. Then my first smoke break, so, 9:20 is when my workday really starts, I'd say.

9:20 to 1:20, that's the grind. Four hours of phone calls, database searches, camera lookups, chasing dead tails, the occasional witness interview. 

Lunch time rolls around, go for an hour, so I'm back 2:30. Maybe 2:35. Then I'm just repeating my morning, but now I'm tired. 

Nothing too exciting.

Except one day I came back from my lunch and I had a folder on my desk. It was an old one, you can tell by the colour. We used brown folders back in the 70s. Well, I took a look through it. Young boy, three years old. Last seen in Texas. Babysitter questioned, mother questioned, then nothing. Cold. Looking at the date, it was due a yearly review. August 30th, 1971. 

He'd be about fifty years old now. If he was alive. He was last seen in the back of a red car... with no other description. No license plate, or make. Nothing.

There were a few photos. One of the car park he was thought to have last been seen. A Park 'n Go near the Tex-Mex border. My money would be on him been taken into Mexico. Maybe even trafficked. 

The second photo was a school photo, of his entire class. He was circled in red. Brown hair, glasses. Tall for his age. He'd be grey now, maybe 6'2. I was about 6'2, and certainly grey, fifty years'll do that.

Third photo was a professional photo of the boy. He was smiling. He had dungarees on. I'd seen this photo before. My dad, god bless him, had this photo framed. 

I closed the file.

[SOLVED]

I clocked out at 4:55, drove home. I visited my dad's grave, I guess he was due a yearly review too.
