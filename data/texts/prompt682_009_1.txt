 - I found you! - The girl was flabbergast: from the uncertainty of knowing who he was, came the certainty about her living place. The birthplace of earth: the consciousness of being from the first human. What a place!
 - That was cool and all... But this is bothering me, somehow... How could you know that you weren't who they said you were? I've been there, through thick and thin, and I did everything to hide... Hide from you and almost from me. Three trillion billion million living things, and you've seen them all. Next time I will be the devil, and you... You will be god. But wait... How? - She wanted to express her anguish, somehow, but the living thing haven't got, yet, the means, or the capacity, to define, and redefine, and express, abstract meanings; he wanted to relieve her from the anguish of not knowing... So they stood still. 
 As time passed by, the living lost their will; the planets lost their way, the stars lost the grim of the brightness that fuelled their moment, in time and space. The girl and the boy, with all their imagined self-importance, with the delusion of being everything better than nothing, got, at last, fascinated by something. 

So they looked at each other for no minute, for there was no time. They stood still at no place, for there was no space. 
- How could I forget? - said the girl, with a ghastly smile... Even without a face! 
- Oh! Now I see... But why?
They could not shake the idea out of their mind. 
 - What mind? - the boy asked the narrator. 
 - I have no body, no place - No form, no name. 
 - I am you...
 - And you are me.
 - If I hide well enough from myself... 
 - Maybe...
 - Just maybe...
 - I will be able to feel certainty... 
 - About the uncertainty of nothing...
 - And everything. 
 - So let it be; 
 - the game of hide, 
 - and seek, 
 - Light!
