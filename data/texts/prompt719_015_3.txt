I stumbled towards the bus stop, beer and in hand, dizzy from drunkenness. The fun of the evening wore on in my heart to the beats that echoed in my head, the cold night air feeling refreshing to my intoxicated mind. The street was pitch dark, but then the beams of the bus rounded the corner illuminating the hedges and trees. I chucked my now empty can to a nearby bush, who caught it with easy - my other hand offered a peace sign to wave down the bus. He pulled in front and I dipped my hand in my satchel, reaching out a fiver and a lump of metal. I ignored the palm sized blob, just stuck it in my pocket, handing the fiver over.

I walked to the back of the bus, the world juddering and spinning as he began to accelerate. I flopped to the nearest seat, and started a conversation with the lad beside me. 

"How ya doing? What's a kid doing out this late anyway?" 
"I'm okay."
After a few seconds pause I gathered he wasn't going to answer my second question. 
"You ever had a night on the town?" 
"No. My brother did once and he got in trouble for it." 
"Wouldn't ya get in trouble for being out late too? 
"I'm not going back."
"Where are ya headed then?" 
"Away from here."
"Lookie here, that's no good idea, there's dangerous types out there." 
"I know." 
"Alright, if your so insistent on leaving, lemme give you something." 

I reached into my satchel, but it was empty. But the metal lump pressing against my leg was still there. I handed it to him. One loaded derringer. 

He stared at me in shock but it was my stop. 

I heard about a kid who shot a man who was trying to rape him a week later. Nobody could work out where he got the gun from.
