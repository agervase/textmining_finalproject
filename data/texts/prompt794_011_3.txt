(CW: Really dark humour. Also, in my head the narrator is the voice of Alexander Anderson from Hellsing Ultimate Abriged.) 

>After the "happily ever after"

We got divorced. This curse, it was too much, until I met her. I, if you haven't guessed it, am immortal. I angered god and she cursed me to walk the world forever. I don't even get to go to hell. Well, depends on your definition of hell I guess, some churches believe it is eternal life without god. But I am off topic.

I met my wife 20 years ago, and we hit it off, but there was this sad look in her eyes on our second date. She apologized, right before she stabbed me through the heart. Literally. As I lay there gasping for air, she starts crying and damning the devil for the curse bestowed upon her. I reached my hand and pat her on the head. I thought she was a dangerous one. Redheads usually are. As I started to stand up, she gasped in shock as the blade fell from my chest and the wound closed. She cried more, happily hugging me. I don't get why women are always crying.

She cried the first few times she killed me. See, her curse is an insatiable and inevitable urge to kill whomever she loved. She has to attempt to kill me at least once a week or she gets the shakes worse than a recovering alcoholic. She couldn't believe it were real either until about a year into our relationship. About 2 more years later, I popped the question, and she said yess by popping my head like a pimple. It grew back, don't worry. On the way to our honeymoon, she highjacked the plane and crashed it into a building.

But I know now we are in a loveless relationship. She hasn't tried to kill me 6 months! Unfortunately we divorced. Funny isn't it, for an who doesn't die, getting killed every week made me feel alive...
