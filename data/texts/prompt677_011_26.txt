WELL....WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?

....I don't know, Janet, I heard-

DO WE STAY IN OR GO OUT?

...I DON'T-

This is a joke right, Tim? Right? 

... 

RIGHT? 

Shut UP! I'm trying to THINK! 

How can we stay indoors and evacuate to high ground without looking outside? 

...I....I.... 

Tim......say something.... 

This has to be a prank or something! Some kind of... 

"STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE! WE REPEAT, STAY INDOORS..."

"EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY, GET TO HIGH GROUND"

Who the HELL is sending this?...Tim, I'm freaking the FUCK out. This doesn't SOUND like a joke. 

Okay, I'll look outside and see wh-

NO YOU FUCKING WON'T! NO WAY! The TV said DONT look outside. If we do ANYTHING we do it together. We STICK TOGETHER! Okay?....Tim? 

You're right...go down together, in flames or glory. 

Tim. This is NOT the time for your asshole theatrics. We could be fucking dying...

OR....we could be subject to a social experiment...or a hidden camera show...or Darrel is being a dick...or-

OR WE COULD BE ABOUT TO DIE! 

Or we could be about to die...

You're an asshole, you know that right? 

I know. 

Good. 

So, Jan, what do you think? 

I think if you call me Jan again then you DEFINITELY won't be getting out alive. 

Soz. 

Fuck you... ...I think that you're right, nothing has happened yet...at all. For the minute we're safe. 

But that could change...

It could..... 

....what the fuck is going on? 

I think I asked you that first...

Yeah...

"STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE"

"EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY, GET TO HIGH GROUND, YOU DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME"

Okay Jan....et, this is really freaking me out. I think we should stay in. If we die at least we won't  see it coming. Whatever...IT is.

I....I was just thinking we should...leave. 

Oh balls... 

Well there's Carsons Hill like a quarter mile away, we could be up there in about 25 minutes. 

We have to stay together. We have to choose. 

Sooo.....flip a coin? 

You're going to potentially let our lives hang in the balance of a coin toss? 

......um.....yeah?

......

.....

Well, I can't think of anything else to do. It's been nice knowing yah, Janet.

Heads we leave, tails we stay.... 

WAIT! 

What?!...wha-

Best of three or.... 

Fuck OFF, Tim. One coin toss. One decision. One outcome. One....really annoying boyfriend. 

RIGHT......I have a silver dollar...I'll use that...HEADS IT IS! ....who was heads again? 

THAT MEANS WE'RE LEAVING THE FUCKING HOUSE, TIMOTHY!

Yeah...that sounds....adventurous. 

It does doesn't it? 

Not really. 

Grow a pair. Seriously. 

Jan, whatever happens, know that I love you. Like, all of you. 

I love you too, and don't ever call me Jan again. 

..... 

See Tim, there's nothing to be-

OH SHI-

--FIN--
