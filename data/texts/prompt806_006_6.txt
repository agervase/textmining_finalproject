Considering doing these once in a while, have not done one before. Feel free to be critical! I take it well, I just may not do anything with it.

\- Q

\----

*“You got me.”*

I cannot lie. It is a part of my condition; my brilliance comes at a cost. I gently close my eyes as Officer Leto slams me into the wall. I feel my shoulder dislocate as I’m wrenched to the ground with a hatred I’ve become accustomed to.

*Ten years.*

The room dances a beautiful spin as the blood rushes to my head, and I turn my face slightly to absorb the fall.

*It has been ten years since I started that fire.*

I feel my brow split as a dark pool spreads across the bone-white marble of my bathroom floor - Italian marble, from Carrera, of course. The pattern is mesmerizing.

*This fade to black, is this what they all felt at the end?*

I awake in a van, cuffed wrist and ankle, my hair a matted mess of dried sweat and stale blood.

*Are they even going to try?*

I politely ask my chauffeurs if either could spare a cigarette.

*I think they’re upset.*

“You fuckin’ animal.” Leto’s partner takes a break from his own cigarette to spit at me through bars separating me from my escort. “You should be put down, not brought in! You wanna feel what it feels like to burn, you fuckin’ murderer?” Leto’s partner presses the cigarette out against my forehead.

*I was never to so rude to my captives. Doesn’t he know smoking kills?*

With a sad grin, I raise my gaze to meet his, his own face a prism of rage and fear as our eyes lock for the for the second time this evening. “I agree.”

*My consciousness fades again as Officer Leto slams the breaks, crumpling me into the wall of the van.*

I awake to a fusillade of camera flashes as I enter the courthouse. As I sit and prepare to defend myself, I take a moment to wave and address my captive audience. “It’s incredibly important to me that you’re all here today.”

*The crowd bristles and security restrains a man from storming the stand.*

Over an hour, the prosecutor’s face turns a majestic shade of plum as he screams invectives at me, accusing me correctly of all the things I’ve done. In a dramatic flourish, he finishes: “So many lives in that fire! What do you have to say for yourself!?”

*I rise and face the crowd.*

“I am innocent.”

*The courtroom erupts into chaos.*

“ORDER!” screams the judge, his gavel ringing hollow against the vengeful, mounting fury of those before him.

*Maybe he should have asked me more directly?*

“INNOCENT!?” screams the plum-faced prosecutor. “Every witness we have on record came TODAY to ensure you never see the light of day, and you declare innocence!? MONSTER!”

*It’s incredibly important to me that you’re all here today.*

I smile at him again as a bottle shatters on the wall behind me. I am led to a holding room, where one security member remains behind to guard me while the rest restore order to the court.

*A fatal oversight.*

Within a minute, I am again alone - the guard’s lifeless body slumped in the corner.

*Another smoker; no endurance.*

I borrow his lighter, and with my thumb and forefinger, I flick the last of his cigarette into a nearby trash can. I close the door as the flames begin to lick at the polyurethane wall padding of the holding cell.

*Smoking kills.*

As I leave the courthouse, I make sure to lock the main doors behind me, as is common courtesy. After all, it was incredibly important to me that everyone was here today.

*When will I be caught?*

You got me.
