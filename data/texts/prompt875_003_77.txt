She was only 15.

The knob rattles as the door wrenches from its frame, barely able to stand tall with the onslaught of her nimble frame ramming into the door. 

“Daddy, please! Why won’t you let me in! I just want to be with you!”

Don’t listen to her. Don’t listen to her, she can’t be trusted. You saw the mark on her arm. They got to her, they had to have. That scar couldn’t be mistaken for anything else. 

“Dad, I’m scared, you’re never like this! Please just unlock the door!”

Her mother went the same way, you can’t get the sight of her head being ripped open from the force of the slug that came from the barrel of *your* gun. For Christ’s sake, she was your *wife*, the woman you told everything to, you held dear for so long, just torn from your life by a single mistake. 

She turned so quickly. She saw you, feverishly shaking, the gun barely aimed, and she screamed and *ran* at you. 

...What’s done is done. 

“Why won’t you answer me! I know you’re in there, open the fucking door, PLEASE!”

They’realldeadthey’realldeadthey’realldead you tell yourself, because if you didn’t constantly ram the thought through your thick skull you’d open the door and join them.  

It’s too much, why did this have to happen, why did this have TO **FUCKING** HAPPEN.

You launch the table next to you across the room. It breaks into a million pieces. You’ll clean it up later, you just want her to stop and leave before she brings more of them here. 

The door won’t be able to handle much more. 

“Daddy, we’re all here for you! We’re just scared, please come out and talk to me! They said you missed your dose, I just want to make sure you’re okay!”

You hear a wailing in the distance. The rest are coming. Your time is up. 

You know it has to end, but, you want to go out in your control. 

If they can take your family from you, you can take them back with you.

“Okay...I’m coming out.”

You quietly pull the slide on your pistol.
