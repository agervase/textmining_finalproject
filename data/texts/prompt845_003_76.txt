    Not like this, this is not what I had in mind. It's not working like it should, even when I do horrible things I'm still revered. I've always tried to help, to be a good man. Violence isn't my way, but I guess that's why I did something bad in my past I tried to make up for. I never wanted to fight a war, so I wormed my way out until it was over. I made money, I created  global empire so I could make lots of jobs to help the economy. But it was  the news I received a few years ago that changed all that, terminal cancer.

   He said I have only maybe a few years, chemo and experimental treatments may extend it a bit. I don't want anyone to know, I don't want people to mourn me when I'm gone. Chemo makes you go bald so I shaved my head and got fake hair implants to cover it up. It also makes your skin look sickly, so I tried a skin cream to reverse its detrimental effects. Its seems to have worked but its stained my skin an odd color, I'll just have to work with it. Next step is to make people not mourn my passing, so I'll make myself hated in the eyes of my people. I'll say and do things that are morally reprehensible, but I'll still help people from behind the scenes. 

   It's been just over 2 years since my diagnosis, and I have no idea how it happened. I sank a small fortune to be heard, said things that 20 years ago would get you lynched and still they cheer. Sure, half of them hate me, but the other half would walk off a cliff if ordered to do so. I've become lazy, slanderous and the target of ridicule and still others salivate over my words. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. All I wanted was to make America great again.
