 Sitting alone in the dark gnawing at the corner of my desk, my assistant quietly enters as not to alarm me, as I'll quickly run to the woods like a scared deer.  She lays the day's itinerary, newest magazines from the dental quarterlies, and yet another survey.  I do not cease my gnawing as I've almost reached the juicy middle, I firmly believe that some day there will be a nougat center, or Bavarian cream filled desk one of these days. 

  I look over my schedule, Johnny Baxter, yes the basis of my research my control if you will.  I firmly believe teeth get sick from eating one another so I wired his jaw in place and he's on a liquid diet for the time being. 

  "Good morning, we'd like to invite you to-" trash..

  "Would you recommend?" No.

  "It has come to our attention that you do not own a single chair in your entire office, even for your patients-" Foools! they not know the risks of chairs and biting your lips once.

  While in med school they mocked me for my theories they'd laugh and say "But Mr. Paulall, this is purely observation bias, you claim success from the most circumstantial." They do not understand my brilliance. 

  The light by my office door blinks three times, the signal there is a patient ready for me in room three.  Just to be safe I remain beneath my desk for several minutes, before clawing my way up the wall and into the vents leading to room three.

  I can see the red light I had installed for the germ free zones in my examination rooms, I look to ensure the door is properly secured before opening the vent to enter partially into the room.  Mr. Baxter is already crying, ah yes my cure for cavities is clearly working, but I've been improving my bedside manner.  "Little Johnny?"

  "yes, Dr. Paulall?"

  "Eating sugar?"

  "No, Paulall."
