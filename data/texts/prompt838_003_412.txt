Okay, so- think. Random phrase. The... prickly miner... conjured up a rambunctious... synergy of octopodes. No one can guess that. That's your code phrase. Good. The prickly miner conjured a rambunctious synergy of octopodes. Keep repeating that. Professor told you about the Dexter Paradox, so don't fuck up. Nobody knows you. Good thing you kept your halloween costume from last year.

1-7-3-8-0-7-0-6, it's 2:06 PM now, it's going to be 2:06 then. Paris, always choose Paris. Going to be quite a journey, no jetlag, but gotta remember to stretch. Guess it's enough space to get some sleep, I slept drunk in an elevator how can this be any different? This looks like the Great Glass Elevator anyway.

Can anyone see me? No one's noticing me or a giant glass contraption in the middle of the city. Must be cloudy today. Louis... 1738, so XV. Can I meet him? With a Larry 3000? Or is it- 

[translation on] *"This dirty thieving boor dared to plunder two loaves of bread and an APPLE from the grocer!"*

*ouch*. Wow, his head just plops right into the bucket. Guess I won't meet Louis CK, I mean XV. But hey, at least I can try out some of the street food out here. Take that Cara, let's see you snapchatting 1700s French food! I think I'll go, wait, no, that- eww what the hell do they eat here in Paris? 

See you've got, okay that's around $15. Need to convince this guy, let's take a shot through body language. Are you fluent in French? Then why the fuck'd you pick Paris you wannabe mime?!

"Excusez-moi, je veux un morceau de gateau."

*"Pardon, nous n'avons pas de gateau en ce moment."*

"Alors, avez-vous the other... les autres... choses pour manger?"

I wave my hands around like an Italian balloon man as he looks at me suspiciously. Gotta say that for a street shop this has got pretty cool decor though, with all the fake artwork and scrawls. It's exactly like Starbucks!

*"Parlez-vous anglais?"*

"Yes."

*Wait a second.* What are the odds of a random street shop owner in 1738 Paris knowing English? You don't even get that in 2016!

"Are you originally an Englishman?"

*"No, I'm not originally from England. I was born in, uh in Bretagne."*

Nice try, Trickster Thierry, I'm on to you. I can see through your fake French accent like a hawk. But maybe you're hiding like I am. But that can't be. The professor only told me about this. But he has other grad students. Let me test him:

"Does the narwhal bacon?"

*"Excuse me?"*

Wait, was that it? Shit. Well I guess I was too suspicious. "Euh, je veux un petit gateau, s'il te plait."

*"Ah bon!"*

He goes to the end of the stall. I suppose I did doubt him after all, what a nice guy. What does this say, if my French is right... "A workman is known by his chips" Neat, and, oh this is challenging. "Mineur" is miner, "conjure" is conjure, "octopode" is- wait a second, he's writing in English! No, that's not it. *OH WAIT!*

"The prickly miner conjured up a rambunctious synergy of octopodes."

He's just staring at me. It's random, but was it really that confusing? Why is he walking out of his own stall?

*"Where's the remote?"*

"Who are you and how do you know about the remote?"

*"You."*

"Me?"

*"Yes. One minute. PIERRE!"*

A scrawny looking white guy comes running toward the baker, and stands to his right. It looks like a '10'.

*"He's you."*

"You're me?"

*"And I'm you."*

"Then him?"

*"You."*

"Me?"

*"Yes, you and him. You're the same."*

"You?"

*"Me too."*

    *"Me too?"*

"Him too?"

*"You too. The three of us. And probably everyone you ever know. Do you know where the time machine is?"*

Wait, it's cloaked. "Follow me."

So mashing the buttons isn't working, then what will? Where the hell is this invisible thingamajig? Oh, there it is.

"Alright guys, I think I'm gonna get going."

*"Wait, we can come too. We're you. Nothing will happen."*

"Look man, I know it sucks for you to be here but at least you've got your business going. I don't even know that much French."

*"I had to get into so much shit to get the business going. I've been stuck here for three years, there's no way I'm going to stay here any longer due to that dumb bastard professor."*

"Well I'm sorry man, but I can't do anything about that. The professor warned me not to take any copies of me back."

*"Understandable. Could you show me the remote at least?"*

Eh, what the heck. He's only inspecting it.

*"ARRETEZ LUI! IL EST UN VOLEUR!"*

Why's everyone running toward me? Where did he go? Where's my remote? Oh I swear I'm such a piece of shit, I'll slap me so hard when I see you again.
