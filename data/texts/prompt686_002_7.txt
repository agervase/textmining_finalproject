My older brother, Loki, was so crass and uncultured when it came to mischief. He always went completely over the top, with all the nuance of a train car of dynamite derailing into an inferno. He would bitch slap people in their face while they slept. He would set off all the car alarms in the parking lot outside the amphiteater where the Philharmonic was playing. Where's the subtlety? That's just being a dick!

Me, however...I was an artist. I had taste when it came to tomfoolery. My pranks were largely thought to be the result of stupidity on the part of another, or nature being cruel. Remember when your wife was pregnant? She was so radiant, glowing, a beautiful expectant mother. I was the one that made her suddenly crave tacos al pastor from the local taco bus five minutes after they closed. Nothing else would do, it had to be food from Jorge's bus that would scratch that itch. I was the one who made her insufferably horny once she got to the point where the doctor advised she didn't have sex. Remember when the Seahawks passed instead of handing it off to Lynch at the 1 yard line? That was me telling Russell Wilson that passing was a great idea. I am the one who corroded the battery terminals on your car battery, the very same battery that happens to be buried under the airbox and is only accessible by taking the wheel off. And when you do try to take that wheel off, you will note that one of the lug nuts simply won't budge. That was me, also, with a bottle of Loctite. I am the rattle in your car that stops when you take it to a mechanic. I was the wrinkle on the ice that made Sidney Crosby trip and fall when all he had left to do was beat the goalie for an overtime winner.

I am Low Key. I'm in the business of subtly fucking with everyone, and business is booming.
