My first ever writing prompt attempt, part 1..

'Well this is a conundrum', I bemused whilst nursing my coffee on a dreary Monday morning. My reflection staring back at me as the scenery dances past in a blur of colour.

Barely noticeable a small tattoo peeks out from behind my ear. So small and brief the words spell Eve with a large mole accenting it before the name. 

I stare, idly wondering about fate and destiny, scratching at the other name inked against my skin. Again 'Eve', branded against my inner wrist like a trademark. I never understood why both names were the same for me. Could the one named Eve bring me both joy and sorrow? Life and death? 

Pouting I stare into the inky abyss of the dregs of my coffee. Concern creasing my face in a conundrum I could never understand. Why am I fated with the pendulum dancing above my head but also with the knife pointed at my heart? 'Love shouldn't entwine death' I croaked, a hoarseness clawing at my throat. 

I thought id found 'the one'. My Gabriel, he swept me off my feet in a flurry of passion and spontaneity that I was in awe. We soon wed before things turned sour. We had two kids to bridge the gap between us, to try and seal our differences, but the ineffective mould soon cracked and we divorced, not able to sate one another or coparent effectively. I see my children, Grace and Daniel twice a week. Im on my way there now as a town sign flitters into existence as the train slows. 

As we come to a halt I grab my bag and make a move to leave the carriage. A strong warm body hits me promptly leave me stumbling whilst trying to hold onto both my dignity and belongings. "Would you mind?" I half shouted, half screamed, whirling to face a tall, dark and very angry man. The look in his eyes made me squeak out a "Nevermind" before I hurriedly tried to exit the carriage and train successfully. I was halted by a hand enveloping my wrist and a firm "Could you wait a second ma'am? I would like to have a word with you?"
