I stood under the tree and its leaves rained down around me. Swirling, twisting in the Autumn wind, tugging at my clothes, the last of my fine silver hair. It was an oak tree. I remember that for one reason only, because I remember asking my father what it was the day we planted it. I never really had time for that sort of thing after...Cold. So cold, as you age the wind bites deeper into your bones with each passing year. 

Even my stick feels wrong in my hand now, knuckles swollen, thin pale skin stretched like the skin on a sausage.

Today feels different, Not just one of a string of rapidly passing days, I didn't even put my glasses on today, broke the habit of thirty years...just something about today...

The leaves turn and twist in the bitter wind, under the tree, in the courtyard, behind the house, in the cobbled lane. All things worth defending certainly; but a life like that... 

The pain started in my arm, a paltry cramp to one used to the agues of a failing body, but grew into a fire. A horrible pressure in my chest my vision greying one knee striking the ground the world blurred by pain and age and tears

but there is a part of me that always remained detached from the world, and it has good instincts.

The stick whipped around my back parallel with my spine, shoulders screaming at the position. Solid thunk of impact as the wood takes the force I came up into a crouch and spun around to face inevitability, even as a splinter of Blackthorn is whipped away by the breeze. The courtyard is as empty as it ever was.

Lips pull back in a gummy smile and the words come out a croak of defiance echoing back from the good old days, "come on then, if you think you're 'ard enough"
