Black. Nothing. Am I asleep? No. Can't wake up. Am I..... Am I dead? Think... Oh. I remember. Oh God.

"Ha! Wrong name pal. Call me Lucy." A warm sweet voice called out. 

Who? What is happening? Where is the voice?

"Lucy! The Fallen One. You just died, honey. And I'm over here, open your eyes for me." She coaxes me.

I slowly blink a few times. I'm suddenly aware that I'm back in my childhood home. I can smell the drool-inducing scent of my father's waffles wafting through the old stucco house. I look over to see a blond woman, sitting at the corner of my bed. 

"Where am I? When am I?" I stammer.

"Why, you're in hell!" She smiled warmly. 

What? What? Actual hell?

"That can't be right. This is my old home. I'm in bed. It's just you and I here. This has to be a dream." I reason out loud. 

"Oh trust me, honey. This is hell. I'm here to help you transition. See, hell isn't fire and brimstone. Not always. Some people live a heavenly life, but they live it poorly, and end up here. Their experiences tend to be of the torture garden variety." She patiently explained.

"Then what about me? Am I on my way to a pain buffet?" I asked nervously.

"No. Others, like you, live a hellish life, and committed sins because of the situation you were put in, and yet still deemed unworthy of heaven. However I've always felt that "hell" can be loosely defined..." she said with a smirk. 

"I don't understand." 

"Lucy's Loophole. The man upstairs is still fuming because our main Hell property is dead these days. I've even turned it into my private music studio!" Her eyes lit up at the mention of music. 

"You play?" I was warming up to this Lucy. 

"Just harmonica." She smiled. "Anyhoo! My loophole is I've developed these 'personal hells' for individuals whom I have judged to have already gone through hell. I return these chosen to where they felt most safe and loved. You have been through enough, dear one. But should you ever grow lonely here, I give lessons on the main property!"

I laughed. "I may have to take you up on that sometime!"

I gasped. It all went dark for a moment. My parent's home. My sister came back. She was off her medication. I was there for Mother's Day. She came with an axe, she just kept swinging it and screaming. Those blood curdling screams. My mom's and dad's mixing with my own. And then her laughter. Her harsh laughter grew more manic as did the puddle of blood around me. I can't. 

Black. 

"Woah there! You alright?" Lucy was cradling my head. 

"What happened?" I panted.

"Your transition. You can't be here for eternity without accepting the end to your past." She was so kind, I wished she would stay with me here forever.

"I accept what happened, but that doesn't make it okay. It doesn't mean I'm okay..." I trail off, tears threatening to spill over.

"You're safe now. And if you'd like, I offer free therapy sessions in the main property, right next door to my music studio! I would love you to come by. Some music therapy is just what you need!" 

So kind. I closed my eyes. I am safe. I can move on. I can begin to heal. I am safe.

Soft harmonica cords floated through the air, and danced into my mind. 

Safe.
