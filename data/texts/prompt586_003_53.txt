"Of course!" Ann exclaimed. Her acceptance of his marriage proposal was so enthusiastic, the author was purposely redundant with the use of punctuation and the following description. Ann and Chris embraced passionately before exchanging a kiss that put the chapter about kisses from _the Princess Bride_ to shame.

After they finally broke apart, Ann gazed joyfully at her new engagement ring. "Holy shit," she thought, "that's the biggest rock I've ever seen."

Chris watched as his beloved's expression gradually shifted to something bordering on mild suspicion. "Is something wrong?"

"No," Ann answered slowly. "I was just wondering... How much did you spend on this ring?"

"Fifty grand. I know it's a lot of money, but we're both ridiculously successful; we've never borrowed money for anything; and our combined retirement savings total $27 million. Besides, just imagine the damage you could do if you slapped someone with that thing. Ha!"

Ann giggled. "That's true, but... I thought we agreed neither of us would purchase anything over $10,000 without discussing it first."

"We did," Chris said. "But I didn't want to spoil the surprise."

The corners of his wife-to-be's mouth twitched uncertainly, as if she couldn't decide whether to be extremely touched by the gesture, or angry that he'd made a significant decision without her. "Where did you get the money?" Her eyes narrowed. "I didn't notice any money missing from your account when I paid the bills."

"About that... The truth is... I received a major promotion about six months ago, and I've been diverting the excess funds into a new account. I SWEAR that's my last secret. I closed the account as soon the jeweler cashed the check!"

She glared at him, then the ring, then back at him. "I-I can't believe you lied." Ann's lower lip quivered at his profoundly romantic betrayal. Other women would've thrown all caution to the wind, but not her... She'd always been obstinately sensible; it was one of the many reasons Chris loved her.

"Please don't be upset, baby. It's a symbol of my eternal love for you. Just think... After we're dead and buried in the same grave, one of our ungrateful grandchildren can wear it. It'll be kinda like that huge, blue diamond in Titanic... Only you're way hotter than Kate Winslet, and you'd share the big door before you let me die of hypothermia."

"DON'T TELL ME HOW TO FEEL. I CAN'T HELP THAT WEARING A RING WORTH THE MEDIAN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. DO YOU REALLY THINK I'M BETTER LOOKING THAN HER?"

"DAMMIT, WOMAN! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE SELFISH ONCE? WE PLANNED THIS TRIP TO PARIS AROUND YOUR FUCKING SCHEDULE AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER. WE BUILT A HOUSE FOR YOUR SINGLE MOTHER FRIEND BECAUSE HER EX-BOYFRIEND REFUSED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT. AND, YES! OKAY? YOUR BOOBS ARE BIGGER THAN HER'S AND YOUR ASS IS WAY MORE SHAPELY. HAPPY NOW?"

"THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. I REALLY LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL RING. IS IT MADE OF PLATINUM?"

"HELL, YEAH. YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO EVERY OTHER METAL ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I DESIGNED THE SETTING MYSELF. HOWEVER, WE CAN COMPROMISE AND TRADE THE DIAMOND IN FOR SOMETHING LESS EXPENSIVE. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?"

"I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR ME. YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD PERSON, AND I'M PROUD TO MARRY YOU. I JUST... I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY; WE COULD DO OTHER THINGS WITH IT. YOU KNOW? LIKE DONATE IT TO A WORTHY CHARITY, OR INVEST IN YOUR BEST FRIEND'S STARTUP AND TRIPLE OUR RETURNS. IF YOU SAY HE'S THE NEXT STEVE JOBS, I TRUST YOUR JUDGEMENT. OR WE COULD HAVE A STELLAR HONEY MOON IN AUSTRALIA. YOU TOLD ME YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE ON OUR FIRST DATE."

"YOU REMEMBER THAT?!"

"ABSOLUTELY. I LOVE YOU AND WANT YOU TO LIVE YOUR DREAMS. I KNEW YOUR WERE THE PERSON I WANTED TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH THE FIRST TIME WE MET. YOU SPILLED COFFEE ALL OVER YOUR PANTS BECAUSE YOU WERE SO NERVOUS, BUT YOU PRETENDED LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL. YOU SCALDED YOUR BALLS, DIDN'T YOU?"

"I DID. THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T CALL YOU THE NEXT DAY; I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH THIRD DEGREE BURNS. FUCK. I GUESS WHEN I SAID THAT WAS MY LAST SECRET BEFORE, I LIED AGAIN."

"THAT'S OKAY. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO TELL ME THAT; IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING. YOU HANDLED IT LIKE A CHAMP THOUGH. AND DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP; YOU'RE HUMAN AND INHERENTLY FLAWED. SO AM I. I LIKE THAT YOU DON'T TRY TO PRETEND LIKE YOU'RE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT. I THINK THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO COMFORTABLE AROUND YOU."

"I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE GOING TO EXCHANGE THE DIAMOND WHEN WE GET HOME AND USE THE MONEY TO GO TO AUSTRALIA, RIGHT?! THIS ARGUMENT IS REALLY BOUNCING AROUND BECAUSE THE WRITER IS KIND OF TIPSY. MAYBE WE SHOULD WRAP THIS UP."

"YES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WAIT A MINUTE... IS SHE GOING TO GET ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE?!"

"I THINK SHE IS, BUT WE'RE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS SO THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. WHY ARE WE STILL SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER?!"

"I DON'T KNOW. I THINK MAYBE SHE'S TOO LAZY TO UNLOCK THE CAPS BUTTON AND CAPITALIZE SHIT. DID WE JUST HAVE OUR FIRST REAL ARGUMENT?"

"YEAH. WE'VE NEVER HAD MAKEUP SEX BEFORE... DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY?"

"GOOD IDEA. SINCE WE CAN'T STOP SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER ANYWAY, LET'S BE SUPER LOUD AND WAKE UP EVERYONE IN THE DAMN HOTEL."

"MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY. THE END."
