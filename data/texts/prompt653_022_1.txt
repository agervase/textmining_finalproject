I stared into the mirror in disbelief for another hour or so. I kept turning my head, looking at it from different angles. It’s a trick of the light, it has to be.

Finally I tore myself from the mirror, walking into my bedroom. The lavish decor and furniture did nothing to ease my mind.

I poured a drink. Scottish brandy, and expensive too. I got one sip before crushing the glass in my hand. The shards cut me in three different places. As I watched, they all sealed in three seconds. At least that’s still there.

I spent years learning this game. Years manipulating, lying and killing to get myself to the top and for what? To die of old age, like some common mongrel? I stormed out of my bedroom and into the living room of the penthouse.

My company (companies if you want to get technical) made me the richest man alive, as well as the most influential. There wasn’t a single world politician I didn’t have in my pocket. Everyone either feared or loved me.

I who waded through blood in a thousand wars, I who wooed a hundred lovers and murdered half of them, I was not going to give up just yet. I owned this world and I was willing to fight for it.

As I lie in a hospital bed, I think back on my life. I think back on the horrible things I did, the lives I’ve ruined. I feel only one thing. Rage.

It was never supposed to end like this. It was never supposed to end at all. I who have outlived empires. I don’t want this. I never wanted this. 

I see my reflection in the window. I am old, far too old. My face is weathered and wrinkled. I am missing half of my teeth. And my hair. What started as one grey hair turned into ten, twenty, a hundred! The jet-black hair I once had is nowhere to be seen. To think that’s what started this.

One grey hair.

I close my eyes and let go.
