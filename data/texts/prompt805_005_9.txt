It has always been dark in my world. I don't mind it though, I find it very serene being able to see my own little world that no one else could. Of course I feel lonely sometimes, but that is just how it goes I guess. It isn't all bad, sometimes I catch passing flickers and flashes though, outlines of what I can guess are what people look like. Sometimes I recognize them from the picture I had built by feeling a person, but some of them are odd, missing an arm or half a face, some looking faded and clueless as to where they were. 

Today was different though, my space felt empty, as if these things could sense something big were to happen. I could hear a crying, from a voice so sweet and soft that it tore my heart apart to hear. I followed the devastating sound, each moment shredding another heart string. I could feel wetness on my eyes, I knew the voice too well, the voice that had always been there for me. I was shaking as I approached. I could see my dad sitting on the couch comforting someone, only the faintest shimmering of a figure. It hit me, I knew from the moment I saw and what I didn't see. My mother wailed harder as my father was pushed upwards and my mother ran into me, gripping my shirt tightly in between her balled up fists, crying into my shoulder.  I could tell she wanted to tell me, but her words kept getting choked between sobs. I put my arms around her to comfort her, whispering softly "It's okay Mom, I know." My dad watched this scene unfold, a sad  smile spreading across his face. "She's your responsibility now Jr, don't let me down now" he said, his form fading with each solom word. 

I wanted to reach out, to grab him and tell him to stay, but he was gone, there was no stopping it. I just sat there, holding my mom tightly to my chest, trying not to sob as bitter sweet tears rolled down my face. "It's okay Mom, I've got you now, I won't let him down."
