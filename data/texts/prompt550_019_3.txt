I had a job as a cashier once. Exploiting my humble abilities to the fullest, always greeting customers by name and making everyone feel appreciated. I’d never soar through the skies or punch through concrete, but I was satisfied, happy even. A simple life, but a good one. 

Until my little sister died. An accident they said. Wrong time, wrong place, could have happened to anyone they said.

But if some freaks in capes hadn’t decided to punch each other through buildings then even the unluckiest son of a bitch wouldn’t get crushed beneath ten tons of broken bricks. I knew who to blame, and it wasn’t random chance, not Lady Luck, not unless she happened to wear tights and go by Stephanie Smith on the weekdays at least.

And it turned out she did, as the whole world found out three days after my sister’s funeral. Closed casket of course, if they even scraped up enough to fill the coffin.

Oh, but you want to hear about the super, don’t you? She had a funeral of her very own not a week later. She’d been found dead in her home after her real name and address had been plastered all over the internet. Someone’s luck had run out.

Likely a false friend or jilted lover, the news said. Truly a tragedy to see one of our brightest die so young. 

But I was just getting started. More and more followed with each passing day. Supervillains killed one ‘hero’ after another at their homes, their businesses, their safe places, delighting in their newfound power until they found out that they were no safer. Raid after raid the world’s greatest villains were carted off to jail. 

They call me many things these days. Assassin. Vigilante. Heroslayer. Villainbreaker. Neither mask nor armor would protect you from me. But at the end of the day I’m just a man.

A man who *never* forgets a face.
