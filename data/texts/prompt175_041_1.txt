*It was windier than normal today.*     
I think of it as more of a word than a name. Do you know how many people are named John, Michael, Sarah, Amanda, Matthew? So many people share the same name. I never bought into it, especially since people these days are known to give false names. I never showed or told anyone the names I had and the only other person that knew was my mother but she died when I was 9 in a car accident. She never got to meet her killer but his name matched one of the names on her arm. The first name I saw of hers is all I knew of my father. Apparently the thought of raising a child was too much so he dipped before I was born.    
*At least the sun is out.*     
Ever since my mom died, I’ve always been a loner. Never really cared for anyone. I was in and out of foster homes and couldn’t tell you how many beds I’ve slept on.    
*Today is my 18th birthday.*
The last family to foster me were Pentecostal. On the outside at least. Tremendous leaders in their church. At home she would whip him as he raped me. They lived in a well-to-do development. He was an engineer. She was a CEO of a bio-tech company. They had no children of their own. At least I had all of the clothes, gadgets and stuff I could ever want. I guess it made up for the abuse. I hated the invasion of my personal space but at least someone was finally paying attention to me.    
*I’ve never been on this side of town.*   
Maybe I was the one making the mistakes. I don’t know, it’s too late now. I’m the only thing I’ve got. 
*At least I left a note.*
The ground was approaching. I looked at the name one more time. I always hated my name. I closed my eyes and screamed my name one last time. 
*Eric.*
It’s over now.
