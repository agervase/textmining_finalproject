An envelope on the kitchen table read simply “Papa.”

Len was just coming in from the office when he saw it. He was absolutely exhausted and unhappy to boot because he’d forgotten to make dinner for the week the day before. As he draped his coat over a chair and dropped his briefcase onto the linoleum, Len called out.

“Maria, I’m home.” Maria was the nanny. Maria picked Lizzy up from school every day and cared for her at home until Len got off work. It was a bit expensive, but also a godsend for a single dad in Len’s position. 

“Maria?” Len called out into the darkness of the living room. The darkness was strange now that he considered it. He walked over to the wall and flicked on one of the light switches, but nothing happened. He tried the others, but only the switch that controlled the kitchen ceiling fan worked. 

“Huh,” Len went over to the circuit breaker, hidden inside one of the kitchen cabinets, and opened it up. This only furthered his confusion as none of the circuits were off. Every switch was on. 

“What the hell,” Len mumbled to himself, then turned around and yelled into the house again, “Maria? Lizzy?” 

No answer.

A hint of anxiety began creeping into Len’s guts as he eyed the envelope suspiciously. He walked over to the kitchen table and picked it up. It was not sealed and the word “Papa” - itself an uncharacteristic choice on Lizzy’s part – was written in Lizzy’s careful block letters. 

Len removed the contents of the envelope – a small folded note and an even smaller packet made of folded paper taped shut. Len put the packet onto the table under the cone of light from the fan and unfolded the letter. 

> Dearest Papa,

> I should begin by saying I do not wish us to be enemies. Indeed, our interests are frequently aligned and it behooves us both to have peace in our realm.

Len rolled his eyes and stopped reading for a moment. Frustrated that this was rearing its ugly head yet again, Len took out a bottle of whiskey from a high cabinet along with a tumbler. He poured himself a finger and took a calming sip before sitting at the table to continue the letter. 

> Perhaps you know already about which I write you. If not, allow me to clarify. The day before last you may remember I returned home from school with the results of my math test. Drawing your attention back to a fortnight ago, you may also remember a treaty obligation you entered into with me, whereby we both agreed that any score above a B+ would earn me the boon of a Carvel double fudge sundae.

Len stopped reading again and let his face fall into the palm of his hand. When, he wondered, would he stop paying the price for Amazon’s stupid mistake? Not that he could entirely blame Lizzy, she took to Machiavelli’s style of aggressive leadership quite intuitively and now that he thought about it he did remember promising her Carvel if she did well on her test. But this just had to stop already. He continued reading, taking another fortifying sip. 

> As you are, I hope, aware, I received the grade of A on my math test. I presented you with the results and waited for the benefit of our bargain. However, to my unhappy surprise, over 48 hours has passed without your meeting your treaty obligations. This has, I’m sure you understand, left me no choice. You may now open the enclosed envelope.

Len shook his head, already guessing the general spirit of what the small envelope likely contained. Tearing it open, he upturned it onto the table, and Maria’s driver’s license slipped out. 

“Jesus, Liz,” Len said to the empty room, “we’re never going to find a better nanny.” Frustrated, he returned to the letter, skimming it quickly just to make sure she had no unexpected caveats.

> If you are willing to abide by our agreement please enter the living room and sing “Jingle Bells”. If you are not willing to abide by the agreement, I am afraid this means war between our two kingdoms, and the first casualty shall be your precious nanny. I assure you she is safe now, but it goes without saying, her future safety depends upon your actions.

> I hope you see reason in these troubled times, Papa.

> Most Sincerely Yours,

> Lizzy.

Len let the letter fall to the table and finished the rest of his whiskey in one big gulp. Slamming the glass down ruefully, in his head Len was already considering several things – where the nearest Carvel was, whether he had any cash in his wallet, what he would say to Maria when he begged her to stay on as Lizzy’s nanny - even as he walked into the darkened living room and began blandly singing Jingle Bells.
