*God damnit, not again*, I thought as he pressed up the chloroform to my nose in an attempt to knock me out.  

*Whatever, let's have fun with this one.*  I feigned unconsciousness as he dragged me into his van.  His seats were firm, uncomfortable, and his driving showed nervousness.  *You'll wake up when he wants you to.  Just go to sleep.  It'll help you.*  

When I woke up, I was sitting in a chair with a camera in my face and a bright light above my head.  

*Asshole.*

"So, I finally gotcha.  They're gonna pay me a lot for you.  Ten million, can you believe it," he explains as he circles me.  I could only hear him; he hid in the darkness surrounding the lone beam blasting my eyes.  

"So are you gonna kill me or just talk about it?"  I ask him.

"Oh, I'm gonna enj- wait, what?"

"You heard me."

"You're... You're supposed to be afraid!  You're just some banker!"

"They didn't tell you who I am, did they?"

"Wh... What are you talking about?"

"You ever think about why that bounty's on my head?   Why it's so damn high?"

"N- No..."  
"Lemme tell ya, kid, it ain't because I just fucked up their interest."

"What are you talking about?"

"God, you're dumb.  The people who employ you, I'm their first choice."

"No, you're lying.  You're getting in my head."  His blade pressed up against my throat.  *Didn't even tie the rope around my ankles.*  I grabbed his wrist, kicked my chair back, and tossed him over me.  

"You really thought they'd give you *millions* for some *banker*?  Really, kid?"  His eyes grew like balloons right in front of me, his cheeks rosy from fear.  The knife was on *him* now.   I sat on top of him, mounting him.  He tried to resist, really, but it didn't do much for him.  

He bled a lot more than I thought he would.
