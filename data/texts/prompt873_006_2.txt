FIRST WP... 

Captain Balnibar rushed into the office. General Labbir was sitting at his desk surrounded by several members of his staff. He was in mid-conversation, but he knew he had to interrupt. 

- Excuse me General, I have some information from the Prisoner we caught in the last mission. I think he has vital Information that may change our plans. - 

The entire room suddenly went silent and all of them looked at the Captain. General Labbir, taking off his glasses, quickly said outloud: "Please leave us alone." 

Once they were alone Balnibar continued. 
- The prisoner we caught from the North Korean fishing boat has some information that I think we need to take into account. 

Without changing his demeanor, the general curtly signaled him to continue. 

- We have not heard of these type of abilities among surfacehumans, but a lot has changed. And as we have increased our technological capacity in the last 200 years, they might have changed as well... We have heard of their advances in genetic manipulation, and it may be linked to that... - 

- What does the prisoner say? - asked General Labbir. 

- He seems to be a very simple man, however he does say that he knows their leader very well and that the leader is apparently 'gifted'. - 

- Gifted in what sense? - asked Labbir. 

-Apparently, he is some sort of 'superhuman'. He is said to be incredibly strong, but to the point of lifting thousands of times his weight... - 

General Labbir observed with a face of disbelief. 

Balnibar continued. 
- From what he says, their leader is a genius, more intelligent than any other human on the planet. Also, he even hints at the possibility that their leader is able 'to fly' and has some sort of powers to control the sun and the weather.  Finally, he also boasts of their leaders' sexual prowess and stamina, although I don't understand why he feels it is so relevant, he mentions it as an integral part of their leaders powers. - 

The general looked back at captain Balnibar with a stern and worried countenance.  He quickly said, "That's impossible. We've never heard of this among other reports from the surface." 

Balnibar continued. 
- Yes, I know this is completely different from everything we've known of the surfacehumans for a long time, but all of our brain scans show us that the prisoner is telling the truth. He is not lying.-

A moment of silence went between them. 

- Furthermore... - he continued. -... when we stated these facts to all the other prisoners we've captured from the other boats, they all corroborated his claims.  They all support what this prisoner says, that in fact their leader is 'superhuman'. - 

Being caught off guard, General Labbir studdered. - Well....even...l...Even if he was... What impact could it have on our entire mobilized Army? - 

- I'm not sure General... But if it's true that he is some sort of superhuman, he may actually not be powerful enough to stop the Army...but he might be able to attack our city directly.- answered Captain Balnibar. 

The General stopped a moment because in fact: he had not thought of this possibility. The chance that a lone individual would attack the city hadn't occurred to him. 

The city in fact was only 4.5 miles in diameter and even though it was protected by a magnetic force field, it was relatively vulnerable if it were singled out. 
The North Koreans, on the other hand, had a gigantic country that held countless military sites and strategic targets. Atlantis, Laputa  or whatever the humans had called it, when they had lived on the surface, was the center of all their civilization. 

After so many years, they had not been able to reproduce the technology for magnetic manipulation in the scale required for another city.  Their "submerged city" remained the cornerstone of their civilization, and exposing it to the surface, was a main concern when the King decided to give the okay for mobilization. 
But Labbir wondered...'If this 'Leader' was actually a great Superman, then why didn't the leader simply attack the City? The North Koreans had clearly guessed the location of the city... Or had they? '

'Could it be that the North Koreans didn't know exactly the location of the city?  It would explain why so many of the missiles had fallen close, but also in an erratic pattern.'

Many years ago the King had decided to stop moving the city, but it seemed it might be a good idea to propose a 'different kind of mobilization'. 

The possibility of a super human leader attacking the city was just too terrible to risk. 

- Thank you Balnibar.- said General Labbir. -... Please tell the others outside, I am leaving to speak with the King. -
