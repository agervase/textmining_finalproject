**Michael**

**2018**

I was flying through the heavens, gliding along the tops of clouds and diving into and out of Edenlike valleys with ease. I passed through majestic waterfalls tumbling from towering, snow-capped mountains into deep, winding rivers passing through a wood that stretched on and on into the horizon, where a series of jagged fjords stood watch over a sea that was just beginning to slip into view as I continued to fly eastward, watching the shadows cast by the tallest trees grow longer over the canopy of leaves and needles, reaching for the waves of the ocean before the sun finally stopped its uphill battle and drifted below the horizon. The brilliant colors of the sky that had made the world look like an autumn scene turned on its head moments earlier soon gave way first to a dim purple expanse dotted with a few stars and the occasional bat, and then an incredible darkness that could only be seen in the night sky hundreds of kilometers from any city or town. Thousands - no, millions of tiny gods danced about and conversed in the center of the wondrous view, forming a band of glorious silver lights and clouds of dust encircling the entire visible cosmos. I looked down at the planet rushing underneath me to see that not only had I passed out over the open ocean, but the usually wavy surface of the water had
become undisturbed and perfectly smooth, like a glass recreation of an impossibly large pond. The milky way now faced me on both sides, its full brilliance surrounding me and then somehow, in defiance of the laws of the universe, closing in on my comparatively nanoscopic form until it fit nicely around my waist like a belt. I reached down tentatively and gave it a spin, causing all of the stars that humans had ever seen until the invention of the photographic telescope to whirl around my form at faster and faster speeds until they were indistinguishable from one another, turning into a glowing ring of celestial fire that replaced everything else within my field of view.

I awoke with a jolt, pools of sweat around my armpits and lower back. My heart was still racing. After getting my breath under control, I stopped for a moment and listened carefully. My severely pregnant wife suddenly snored with enough force to shake apart the Moon, almost as if her body was putting me at ease by informing me that no, I had not woken her up.

Deciding I had to get my adrenaline levels back down if I wanted to go to sleep, I got out of bed carefully so as not to pull the blankets off Emma and descended the stairs in the dark, only flipping on a light once I had fumbled my way into the dining room. I poured a cold glass of milk, downed it in two gulps, and placed the glass on an increasingly large stack of dishes.

Despite my best efforts to keep quiet while departing on my quest for milk, I saw my wife's form propped up in the dark when I entered our bedroom again.

"Honey, why are you up?" She asked sleepily.

"I had another one of those great dreams. I had to get a glass of milk to go back to sleep."

"Do you think it has something to do with the baby?"

"Maybe. It wouldn't be unheard of for an Endowed fetus to have telepathic abilities in utero. I'll be right back, I have to take a piss. Try to get some sleep, okay?"

She muttered something in response about not being able to get any sleep since she was twenty-four.

As I was finishing up in the bathroom, I heard Emma say something through the bathroom door.

"What was that?"

"Michael, my stomach is glowing!"

I sloppily shoved my member back into my sweatpants and threw the door open. Her abdomen was indeed glowing. The otherworldly orange light cast faint shadows onto the wall, like those created when a kid playing with a flashlight in his room past his bedtime shines the light through his fingers and creates a dim red beacon of light in the middle of an otherwise pitch-black space.

She yelped and started to slide out of bed. "My water broke! The baby's coming! Michael, the baby's coming!"

"Oh, shit. Shit shit shit. We have to get you to the hospital. Throw a shirt on or something, I'll get the car started!"

Fifteen minutes later, Emma was being rushed into a maternity ward while I struggled to keep up in my bare feet and baggy sweatpants. A nurse grabbed my arm and held me back as her bed was pushed into a room three doors down.

"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to stay in the waiting room for this. We've never dealt with a pregnancy that's lasted this long. Nobody has. In case-"

"She's my fucking wife, and I'm going to stay by her side to-"

"Sir, don't make me call the police. With your wife being the current record-holder for the longest pregnancy ever, this is officially a government matter."

I was about to object, but then realized it wasn't worth being arrested. With a defeated sigh, I let the nurse escort me back to the waiting room, where I slumped into an uncomfortable plastic chair and stared at the patterned carpet after several failed attempts to distract myself with magazine articles.

The next twelve hours were a unique mix of excruciatingly boring and terribly worrying. Every twenty or thirty minutes, a nurse would come by to let me know that Emma was okay. Most of the time, there would be no more than two other people in the austere room with me. Usually, they would be parents of kids who had fallen off bunk beds at four in the morning or started throwing up blood around sunrise. A few groups bypassed the waiting room altogether, rushing past the counter at the lobby on hospital beds with blood-stained emergency gauze covering various unlucky parts of their body.

Around three in the afternoon, roughly the twelve-hour mark, two nurses and a doctor woke me from a fragile sleep that I had managed to fall into while stretched out on the floor under a picnic blanket I had brought in from my car. 

"Schmidt? Michael Schmidt?"

I rubbed my eyes and slid my glasses on. "Yes, that's me. Is she okay?"

The doctor looked at one of the nurses, who was holding a clipboard, with a mildly worried look. My blood temperature felt like it dropped forty degrees.

"Yes, she's healthy and alive. She's been in labor an unusually long time, however, and due to several variables we haven't had any serious experience with here, we've elected to put her in a medically induced coma and place her on life support for the remainder of the process. We'll simulate the biological processes with machinery and various chemical means."

"Is that even possible?"

"It clearly is, otherwise I would not have proposed it in the first place. If your assumption was that it is revolutionary, however, you would be correct. We have never tried it before, because we have never had a reason to. The runner-up for the world record for longest gestation time until now carried her baby for nine years, but she gave birth to her daughter in just seven hours. We're doing everything we can to make sure that the rest of the birthing process goes smoothly, even if it takes another fifteen years."

I choked on a breath I was taking at the mention of her labor taking another fifteen years.

"That was a joke, Mr. Schmidt. We'll start considering other options long before that."

"Thank God. Can't you just do a C-section and be done with it? Surely tricking her body into giving birth while she's in a coma is expensive beyond reason."

"We will perform a C-section if no other options present themselves. However, we consider it a last resort, as there have been several reported cases of Endowed fetuses becoming severely deformed after the procedure, for reasons unknown to current medical science. One hospital in China even claims that a newborn removed by Cesarean spontaneously combusted on contact with the air, killing itself, the mother, and two staffers."

"Jesus."

"So you can see why we'd prefer to spend a few million dollars keeping her in a coma while the child is being born."

"Yeah. Yeah." I heaved a sigh and rubbed the sleep off my face. The doctor paused for a moment, looking at me sympathetically.

"Look, your wife is going to be okay. Why don't you go back home? Eat something. Try to get some sleep. We'll call you when your child had been born, alright? We have your phone number on file, you are our highest-profile patients ever, after all. I promise you, as soon as your kid's feet are in the air, you'll be told. You'll know before the technicians in the room."
