What a peculiar poker face the universe had. To many imaginations, the world should have gone dark by now. Though it hadn't. The sun still shone through the despair. Mankind was looking at their worst nightmare as it unfolded into fruition. 

As human fear and fantasy came true at once, it seemed as though the universe had been counting cards against man himself, and women alike, and were now bidding high, with the odds against the only planet we've ever lived atop.

Not soon enough to save the lives of 6 billion people (and counting), but soon enough that the smartest inventors and scientists could break boarders and share notes.

Earth lost the majority of its biological population. Pollution seemed to vanish. Support groups reached out over radio signals. People convened and healed together. Race was no longer someone's nationality. It was their home planet. The United People of Earth gathered their things and embarked on their voyage to salvation. 
They started growing food again. They even began recycling. Unexpected, for an apocalypse tale? Yes. Impossible? You decide.
