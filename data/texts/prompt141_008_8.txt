The idea wasn't what bothered me the most.... it was the *Ripping* noise it seemed to echo in my spirit.

The sound of my skeleton slave ripping apart my body so that he could best serve me. That's what I get for enhancing the goddamn size, and durability of the skeletons. I felt my flesh tear, some of blood vessels popping, my heart was beating faster, my eyes started to sink in. The last thought that shot through my brain was a single saying, spoken by a voice I hadn't heard since I first started to train as a necromancer years ago.

*Te aeternum* 

My eyes snapped open, as I stared at a ghoul from across the room. "What the hell just happened?! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!"
I said. My voice had a strange echoing noise behind it. I looked at my body I could see my hands, my old robe that I had been wearing, a few vials across my belt, and a wisp of my legs. 

*Where are my legs?* 

I could **feel** them they were there holding me upright but I couldn't **see** them. Then I felt them move.

The ghoul shuffled over to me stumbling, as pieces of flesh fell off his body, I wanted to run this was disgusting even for me. I rob graves for a living, but fuck I have standards. Then, I recognized the emblem on the beast chest, the emblem of Entyia, my home.

I could feel the cold ground as the beast kneeled in front of me, one of it's, **my** small eyes rolled out of the now too large socket hanging like a ball at the end of a thread. Next came words that shook me, and made me realize how much I had truly fucked up. My voice spoke to me hollow, and spitting as blood poured from it's mouth onto the ground.

" **My master, you called for me?** "

"Oh, Fuck, I'm dead"
