The old man lay silently in his bed, and a thin ray of moonlight creeping through a sliver in his curtains reflected off the short blade mounted on the wall in front of him. He'd awoken from a peculiar dream in which every person he had ever defeated was standing before him, swords drawn, poised to attack, and now he eyed the familiar blade intently. 

It was his favorite, by far, for its elegance and because how natural it felt in his hand; it was an extension of himself, and he felt whole with it firmly in his grip.

Suddenly, the light reflecting off the blade was interrupted by something moving in the shadows. The old man was up in a flash, moving much faster than he had in ages, he stripped the blade from its resting place, spun on his heels, and his blade met an opposing force just inches from his face. 

The foreign blade was only a few inches longer than his, but it carried with it an imposing aura; and behind it, the wielder, was as black as the night's sky. 

The attacker drew back quickly into the darkness, and the old man was left seemingly alone in the black. 

"***That is certainly...unusual***" 

The voice was unnerving, and it brought with it a certain vibration that the old man could feel all over. 

"***Never before has anyone parried my strike; you should be proud, friend.***"

The old man smiled, still peering over his blade held up in a defensive stance, "I'm sure you've murdered many proud opponents, *assassin*, but you'll have no luck killing someone as disciplined as me."

There was an unsettling laugh in the shadows, and the voice echoed all around the old man.

"***I suppose I am an assassin, of sorts, but I only take what is already dead.***"

"Enough, find your courage and complete your devious task!"

"***That blade mounted behind you, it is your favorite, it is not?***

The old man backed up slowly so he could glimpse at the spot where he had grabbed the blade but was surprised to find it still resting peacefully on the wall, while still clearly in his hands. 

"***And that old body still in bed, could it move so fast at that age?***"

His eyes were adjusting now, and he could make out a figure in his bed where he had been moments ago.

"Do you hide amongst my sheets, assassin!?"

The once slender ray of moonlight suddenly illuminated the entire room, and the old man thought briefly of heaven in the blinding light. Once his eyes adjusted, he searched slowly for the intruder, but found nothing. Just his room, with various swords hanging here and there, his cherished blade still somehow in his hand and on his wall simultaneously, and his own body, still resting in bed.

"What is this? Who are you?" He voice slipped out and his blade wielding hand fell to his side.

"***How many have you killed by sword, my friend?***"

The old man paused, rewatching every fight in his head in an instant.

"None."

"***Yet you are undefeated?***

"I do not fight to kill; the art of the sword has been a spiritual journey for me."

"***And I am an assassin who does not kill; I simply guide you to the next stage of your journey.***‚Äù

Things were making sense to the old man now, and his sudden realization that he had parried Death washed over him. He laughed, "Am I really the first one?"

"***The very first, and you have my utmost respect, but there is still a duty to be done.***" 

The vibration was soothing now, like an embrace from an old friend.

"Will it hurt?" The old man closed his eyes, ready for the unknown.

"***No. Life brings pain; but death, death is a long, peaceful night, swordsman.***"

He sensed the strike coming; and for the first time ever, he surrendered himself to it.
