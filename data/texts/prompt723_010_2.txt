"After many years of technological advancements we are finally able to tap into the human internet. But before doing so, let us review how we got here. From what we know, the climate significantly changed about three million years ago, it was good for us, but bad for the humans. We got more food resources, yet humans have died out. We believe many species have died out. They were the dominant species of their time.

What helped us thrive was that we live in the ocean, which provides an atmosphere and supports life. Land creatures have only a very thin atmosphere in the form of air. This certainly helps against small comets, but wouldn't help against a big asteroid, or many other naturally occurring disasters which water naturally protects us from. We are surprised that intelligent life could have developed on land, but we know it did, and it did before us.

We've learned many things about technology from their ships, which they had to use to get from one land mass to another. We've learned of plastic which initially caused problems for many of us.

The latest technological knowledge we harvested was nuclear power, from their submarines. This is also how human technology was able to continue for so long after their demise. Now please turn your attention to your screens, we have been able to tap into the human internet, and we'll beging to broadcast it first on the most relevant topics, and later you'll be able to navigate it yourselves after it's completely downloaded to the internet, that is our internet."

I reached over to the keyboard on the right side which was modeled based on human keyboards, it made me a bit notious.

My tenticle gently pressed enter, Wikipedia opened to octopuses, as the page scrolled, there was a topic 'Octopus as food'. Our audience was hooked.
