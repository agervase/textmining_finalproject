"So what will it be this time, Margie?" Death asked. He had a handsome way about him as he entered the room, Margie thought. The way he strutted about with that fire in his eyes, the smell of burnt leaves that seemed to follow him. Why did the darkness appeal to her so much? 

"Come on Margie, I don't have all day!" Death said. Margie sighed, "yes you do", she said, "you have as long as it takes, we've both been here before".

"Don't I know it", muttered Death. 14 lucky guesses in a row. One hundred and forty years ago he thought that number thirteen might be his lucky one. Two lifetimes later he was beginning to doubt it would ever happen. In fact Margie was his longest running contestant, but he wouldn't tell her that.

"Don't you ever get tired of it?" Margie's question interrupted his thoughts. "Don't you?" Death responded. "All these years spent chasing the same things, following the same familiar routines amassing wealth and power and for what?" He challenged her, his tone mocking.

Margie first died during the crusades. She went by Hanna back then, and was made to watch as her children were killed by the English knights as they rode for the Middle East. She chose life for revenge, lived to avenge the deaths of her children and several hundred years later even managed to destroy the Knights Templar, in a truly impressive scheme.

"Of course I do", said Margie. But I still haven't figured out how to destroy you. Death sighed, here we go again, he thought. "The Knights skewered my children, sure", Margie continued. "You were the one that took their lives however. I will go on for as long as I have to."

Death was getting anxious. There was a way, not that a human could ever figure it out. Then again, Margie wasn't your typical human by any means. "Just call it!" He yelled.

"Heads!" Yelled Margie.

Death flipped his coin, snatching it out of the air, flipped it over onto his wrist, looked down and smiled. He was safe.
