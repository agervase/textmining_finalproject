It hurts, everything hurts. Something is not right. I can't control my body, why can't I control my body? I scream, that's all I can do. I can't see my surroundings, everything is blurry and undefined. Something is very wrong.  
From what I felt before waking up inside that warm place, I think I may have just been born. I remember dying, so re-incarnation must be true, but this is not how I remember being born the first time. Where's the Great White Hall? Where are the welcoming choruses? Where are the soft robes for the newly made skin? I remember coming into the world and saying hello to my family, everybody was so happy, I was so at peace.  
But here I am and everything hurts and feels cold and large and scary. Wait, there is a memory, in the Twilight Place after my death... there was something important being communicated to me. I'd been wrong, very wrong about things in life. I'd followed the wrong teachings I... Oh my God, this can't be.  
I lead a good life. I enjoyed the mana, and the love, and I loved. I listened to the enlightened masters. But I paid closer attention to the one which people warned me not to listen to too closely. His ideas where fascinating. But he was wrong and I didn't worship God the way I should have. I died a good death, in peace, once my five hundred years were completed, surrounded by my children and my children's children into several generations. The goodbye songs lead me into dissolution.

I now know that what I feel is hunger. I know the concept, I guess one must understand the punishment. Oh but the way the hunger is sated, the flesh in my mouth, the humiliation. And I suckle so desperately it's monstrous of me, and of the woman who feeds me. When alive I just stood under the the light of the three suns, letting their energy bathe me, letting the wind envelop me, letting the mana flow into me, I never knew hunger.  
And what happens after, when the food has made its way through, I try not to think about it, other times I try not to eat just so that doesn't happen, dear God the smell... But I can't hold for long, I find myself screeching in hunger pains, and the woman takes me and feeds me and I can't fight it, I'm so week, and so small.  
Is she a demon? Or is she another damned soul? I can't ask any questions, I can't speak.

It's been two years since I came into Hell. I can communicate somewhat, I can control my body much better. There are new pains, there is new suffering. But the worst is I can now understand that even greater pains and sufferings await in the future.  
When I was two years old, while alive in the world, I enjoyed poetry and had begun writing my own, the multicolored night sky was my first inspiration, the orbs of the worlds moving across the deep blue and bright green and ethereal orange, the aquamarine streaks of the bolides, the music of the spheres, I endeavored to capture all of that in sonnets.  
Here I scribble with wax in paper, I can barely make my hands do what I need, I despair, I draw death because I yearn for release, but what release is there for the damned soul?  
  
__  
  
I don't understand. Don't this people know they're damned? They don't seem to be demons, at least the ones I know, they are just poor souls doomed to spend eternity here in Hell. But they don't know it. I am five years old now and I can talk with them, and they don't know, they don't remember the world and life, and they stare at me with worry, with horror when I try to tell them what's the nature of this place.  
I was never looked at but with love when I was alive, love and empathy and joy. I didn't know people could grimace with their eyes, but the damned souls here can certainly do it.  
I am growing, physically, and that's uncomfortable. The living body is immutable, but this fakery of flesh is born incomplete and needs to grow. All the processes of this hell bodies are torturous.

The damned who believe they are my parents have sent me to a woman who asks me questions and tries to figure out why I say the things I say. I tell her it's because I can remember what she, what everybody here, cannot. I tell her we are in Hell and she becomes very concerned.  
  
__  
  
They are giving me something. I am eight years old and the parents grow more and more worried. I think I may be part of their punishment, they must have sinned greatly in life because my words hurt them deeply. So now they are giving me pills, medicine which numbs my mind. I don't understand, why would Hell allow me to be numbed? Doesn't hell want me to suffer as much as possible?  
  
__  
  
I had no idea, no idea what shame was, what humiliation was, until my body betrayed me in this way. I'm fifteen years old and my mind is full of repulsive apetites and yearnings. They tell me it's normal, they explained some time ago what all of this was about.  
When I was alive, you loved another person more deeply than the rest, you embraced them, your souls melded and you knew exalted love, you sang, you gloried in each other, all with the highest of dignities, and then you felt the pull of the Great White Hall, of the Birthing Gates, and you went there to welcome your new children.  
Here in Hell it's all flesh and glands and secretions. Here in Hell you have no dignity, you can't even truly love because the brain betrays. The thoughts disobey.

They call this an asylum. Hell is not homogeneous, suffering concentrates in certain areas, and this is one of those more saturated ones. I tried to rid myself of the offending flesh which tortured me since I became a teenager, and the parents and the doctors were horrified. Fools! Why don't they do it too? It is their carnal actions which serve as a gateway for the doomed to enter Hell! But they don't remember, they don't know.  
So they put me in this place where they numb my mind even further and restrain me and talk at me. They want to fix me, they don't know they're the ones who are broken, afflicted by amnesia. What is the point of having them not remember? Does that not lessen their punishment?  
  
__  
  
I gave up, I conceded. This isn't Hell, I told them, this is the living world. Your words and your pills and everything else, it was worked, my brain has also become afflicted by amnesia -although that I didn't said-, and I believe this is the world and my actions I can now see are pathological. After a while they believed me, there was relief in my parents eyes, but we are where we are and relief can only mean a reprieve of punishment so that the next torture can hurt even more.  
I walked out into the world and discovered that some of the things really did hurt less, there is a permanent numbness in my mind, in my soul there is a coldness.  
Now I know what must have happened. Some of the people at the asylum talked, and in their insanity said correct things. Some of them even vaguely remembered, some of them must have been channeling the voice of God.  
God made a mistake, he must have. When creating the soul perhaps, when creating the anima or the spirit or the living body. When creating the passage into afterlife, I don't really know where or when, but He made a mistake and the doomed souls that enter Hell have no memory of their real life, of their time in the world, they come here as blank slates, and as such they have changed this place. I can see that now, where there should have been only pain, from within their ignorance they find solace and purpose and even hope. They hide the nature of hell behind stories and cities. They've grown used to this existence.  
But for some reason I remember, whether God is trying to fix the mistake, whether I was a further one, or whether my punishment or that of those around me, was meant to be harder, I don't know. But I remember. And they should too, if they can't they should be taught. If they can't be taught the truth, then at least they should not be letting other souls enter hell through their repulsive passions.  
  
__  
  
I've known for a long time that the denizens of Hell can die too. Where do they go? Is that the final death, is that oblivion? Is there a further Hell? If it is oblivion then it should be merciful to facilitate the transit there. If it is a further Hell then maybe there they can remember, maybe there they can redeem themselves through acknowledged pain.  
  
__  
  
It's been forty years. I have been teaching, some people have begun listening. I don't tell them everything outright, just that this life is pain and there must be something better, just that this place is a lie, a horror behind a mask, and that mask must be taken down. They listen, and some follow.  
  
__  
  
I've taken my followers away from the places where the lie is thicker. In the desert you can see better the hellish nature of this realm. There were no deserts in the living world. Their memories cannot be jogged, but they believe me, they trust me, and I will honor that trust.  
Now I have revealed that this place is Hell, and they understand.  
First, I told them to stop being gateways for the damned souls, and the offending flesh was removed, now they will not be part in the suffering of others.  
Then I told them about deliverance. If there's another Hell under this one, at least it will be known and there may be redemption in acknowledged pain. If there's only oblivion, then it will be the end of their pain.
