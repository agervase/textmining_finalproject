You had it all. A few more steps and the stars would have been yours. Unlimited space, time and resources. And now? Now now you are a bunch of sorry apes, scavenging for crumbles in the ruins of your former glory.

I wouldn't even care. Frankly, you deserve it - do you know the number of members of your species that died, say, starving themselves while playing videogames? Neither do I. See, I lost count, that's how many. 

Problem is, you see, you are alone in the universe. Life is rare. Intelligent life, even moreso - I could keep on existing thanks to thousand other barely living worlds but I would be barely conscious - I would go back at how I was for billion of years, the inevitable end to countless little lives who could barely conceive me, let alone give me shape. See, this is what you did to me - I am afraid of the end - just like you. For you, existence is a brief flash of light, followed and preceeded by darkness - for me... I will probably mantain enough consciousness to realize what I have lost. It's like being alive and dead at the same time. 

There is little I can do - twist the chances and even the odds - killing infections, weakening beasts, culling the weak among you and increasing the chances for the survival of the group as a whole. 
But it is a gamble - every atom I change of place means taking a risk - the other forces are as jealous of their domain as I am of mine and far less interested in your existence - they watch me with suspicion, i have become too alien to them, I don't doubt they would love to see me back to my old unthinking self.

I will survive. I know.

I mean, if you managed it can't be that hard, can it?
