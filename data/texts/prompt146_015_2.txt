"Look I know you've said my car is no longer functional, but can you think of any other word for it?"

&#x200B;

The mechanic cocked an eyebrow and shuffled uncomfortably in his blue jumpsuit. "Was this another one of those whackos from the church down the street", a cautious voice rang in his head. He looked over his shoulder, the butt of his shotgun sticking out of the side of the cash register, and it gave him some solace. He turned back around and sighed.

&#x200B;

"Sir, it ain't movin'. It's non-functional, kaput, busted, broken, written off, all but buried".

&#x200B;

"Ah-ha!! All but buried!", the besuited man laughed. His pale skin and sharp, angled features contorted into the kind of smile we're warned sit on the faces of crocodiles. He immediately fell to his knees and began to mutter to himself. "Is that Latin?", the same cautious voice echoed inside the mechanic's mind. Whatever it was, all the mechanic could hear was "Go get the shotgun". He took a few long, cautious steps backward and stood next to the cash register.

"I dunno what you're doing there mister, but you've got a good 30 seconds to get off the property before I shoot you". The pale man threw himself on the ground in frustration and he sprang himself to his feet. He leapt forward and began rambling.

&#x200B;

"I need you to SAY the D word, sir. The D word, do you know the one I mean? I can't trick you into it, you need to describe my Ford Fiesta as... you know... no longer with us!!". The mechanic slid the shotgun out from the side of the till and held it aimed at the ground. "I won't tell you again sir". The pale man was unphased by this new development. 

&#x200B;

"Look, okay, how's about this. If you were to shoot me with that shotgun, I would be...", he tailed off and held out his hands, begging for a response. The mechanic grunted and lifted the shotgun up to waist height. "In a shit load of pain", he responded. "NO! Well yes, okay I grant you it wouldn't be a pleasant way to go but AFTER the pain... after the pain I would be....", another extension of his pale hands, every finger covered in glinting jewels of various colours and sizes. "Well, you'd be dead as a damn badger in a bathtub!", the mechanic roared and lifted the shotgun, his frustration threatening to overflow. The necromancer's hands lifted up in a surrender, but his eyes were wide with glee. "Yes, yes I would be indeed! And, so, how would you describe the car, in light of this new addition to your vocabulary?", he spoke. That same vampiric smile protruded from his face, and he almost mouthed the word. The mechanic spoke slowly, cautiously. "The car... would be... I dunno... dead?".

&#x200B;

The pale man dropped to his knees, closed his eyes and lifted his palms to his side. The mechanic nearly shot him then and there, but he had made his way forward and was now on the carpet. Brains were rather difficult to remove from Venetian cotton. Suddenly, from behind him, he heard a deep, familiar growl. The mechanic swung around and, in stunned silence, saw the previously dismissed Ford rumble to life.
