One thing you should know about me, is despite what is printed on my passport, it is a lie.

My name is not John Smith. Well, it is now. But I used to be Gregory Hill. Before that, I was George Freeman. And before that...

You get the point.

One thing all of these men, all of these identities that I took in the past was that each spanned about thirty years each. That adventurous man who loved travelling, meeting new people in different expeditions, trying out things that no man could do.

I am immortal. A god? Probably not. I feel as though I am barely more than human. A fine specimen, I must say, but no lightning bolts or magic has came from me yet.

I have lived for thousands of years, but I have never been truly bored. This world has a lot more to offer than it meets the eye. I have lived, and I have loved, but in the end, I move on, as I must.

I was indignant. This woman was only, what, seventy years old? I have lived literally centuries, nay, millenia longer than her! She is but a pup to my-

That was when the rest of what she said hit me.

She gave a gentle smile and motioned at me to go.

I bolted for my bathroom, and the face that mirrored mine waa surprised, then shocked. Then I fell to my knees crying.

Of all the things that could have happened. This has never once happened in my life. A head of silvery white hair.

I have finally grown hair!
