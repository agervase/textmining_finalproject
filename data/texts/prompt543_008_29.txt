Wellingtons orphanages, founded by Clause, j, Wellington 1919. After the first word war, General Wellington, together with a handful of ministers, went on to create an supernatural engineered army to reinforce the British borders, in prevention of future wars. His assortment of men was given a military facility together with (at the time) highly advanced laboratory and 45 biologists, all funded personally by the king. Their operation was to be called Black Army.

After WW2, the government  shut down the establishment together with the operation Black Army, in violation of human rights. Over 3000 supernatural engineered soldiers was let free and realised in to society. These supernatural beings ended up breeding in to human society and created numerous of offspring. These offsprings was proven to create a big threat for the good name of Britannia.

The government set out to reinforce the old military facility and re build it, to serve as a rehabilitation center for these offspring, with supernatural power. To educate and protect them from ever being used as a weapon ever again, (and to hide the fact, that Britain associated itself with human experiments) to prepare and then later place these creatures in society as functional human beings. 

It was and still is, top priority to keep any evidence of operation Black Army a governmental secret, and to no circumstances ever let the public now, that supernatural beings are living among them.

Head mistress Mara Richards was to the looks of it a stern woman, always dressed in grey and nude coloured business attire, shown sporting the Wellington emblem. She originally came to the orphanage as an highly sort after discipline teacher and slowly there after made her way to become head master. 
As stern and professional as she looked, was far from here true self. In here privet times, she was more of a laid back and loving person, rather then the icy cold old lady, as many of here staff often called her, behind her back. She believed that being professional and serious was a necessary in her field of work, in order to come across as serious. In hereoff work hours however, she didn‚Äôt hesitate to let lose a little. 

She truly loved all the children at the orphanage and was thrilled when giving the job of head mistress. Now rather then teaching discipline classes, she was in charge of the staff membership, budget and the political communications with the government. Since she took the position, she constantly had to deal with hungry politicians breathing down here neck. It baffled her that so many wanted to use the children in military purposes or dead. She had seen some of the most ugliest darkest truth, hidden beneath the public facade, that politicians hide from there supporters.

She was currently reading a report from one of the host families. A host family was the final step in rehabilitation, some gets hosts earlier then others, depending on the rehabilitation process. This family had taken an old student of hers, promising Jung boy, whom could breath fire. He was around 16 and was doing great so far. What she could tell.
