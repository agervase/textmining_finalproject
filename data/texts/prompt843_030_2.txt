I wish I had chosen to relive any other day. 7212. The water dripping on the concrete floor stopped as the door opened; the pair of familiar squeaky boots lackadaisically walked towards me. The correction officer peered through the grating in the middle of the door "How you feeling shitbag? I put something extra in your last meal." I could feel officer jones sideways grin from the other side of the metal door as the electronic beep of my door unlocking meant it was time to stand.

I tuned him out for the 7212th day in a row. I knew the procedure: stand, face the wall, wait for cuffs, then walk the same 215 steps down the hallway. At the end the two officers will strap me to the chair and the chaplain will walk in. I clenched my eyes shut and began walking. 

*It had been a long trip, the final leg of the family car ride felt lonely with the wife and twins dead asleep not making a sound. I put the three of them to bed gently and quietly slinked out to the backyard with a blanket for a coffee and cigarette under the stars. It was a dazzling night without a cloud in the sky.*

I opened my eyes as the chaplain began monotonously reading my last rites. Officer Jones wore the same grin as I had imagined when I was in my cell. 7212 days, and each one I would easily make the same decision to end his life here and now in this room but it wasn't his life in jeopardy. The next while would be the doctors attaching the electrodes to me, and the long wait for the "switch" to be pulled at 8:00. 

*I woke up, the coffee had gone cold and the morning dew had condensed on my mug and blanket. I walked inside to wake up the wife and kids. I leaned over my wife who had drooled on the pillow. I couldn't help but chuckle and shook her gently, "wake up, it's almost 8:00, we've got to get breakfast ready". No response. "Honey?" No response, something was wrong, her body was too cool. I remembered my cellphone was in the kitchen, I lept up and ran. My mind raced, the closest hospital is 15 minutes away. I can take her, or should I wait for an ambulance? Either way 911 will know what to do. Half way to the kitchen out of the corner of my eye I saw one of my daughters slumped awkwardly on the wall. No.*

I opened my eyes again and I glanced at the clock, it was a minute before 8:00. The doctors were done, and I was just left with the cold empty room. I felt the eyes from the other side of the glass glare at me, but I couldn't see who was watching.

*I wish I hadn't bought an old house with heating problems.*

*I wish I hadn't meddled with the heater furnace and had just hired a professional.*

*I wish I had left the Windows open when we left for the hiking trip.*

*I wish my family was awake on our final car ride.*

*I wish I had a chance to say goodbye.*

The eyes glaring on me intensified as the clock approached the hour hand approached 8:00.

*I wish my lawyer had competently argued my case.*

*I wish I hadn't fallen asleep outside.*

*I wish I had slept in the same bed as my wife that night.*

*I wish I would have died.*

I was choking back tears at this point. I hadn't been able to protect my family, did I even deserve to live at this point? I must be seconds away from death. Just wait and let it come. Just let it happen, let it all go. It will be quick and peaceful. 1 more second.

I wish I could have chosen to relive any other day. 7213.
