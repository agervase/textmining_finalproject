It was a cruel joke; his predestined last words. You would think it would be a gift. To have such sweet last words, but it meant he could never say the simple three words for as long as he lived. 

For years, he had known he couldn't say them. Somehow, he knew, in the back of his mind. That those words would doom him. He had never told anyone, alienating them, to the point that even his parents thought he hated them, there simply had never been any proof.

Then the gift of an accident happened. It had been a happy, giddy day. It was proved, he thought: he would never die, for the simple cost of those words. Until no one came to apologize for disbelieving or congratulate him for defying death. They just didn't care about him anymore. Or they just didn't believe that the accident was real.

Vicious, sad years later, he understood that it wasn't a gift. He could never express how much anyone meant to him. It was sadistic. Only his fear kept him immortal. The cost so seemingly simple. Each relationship crumbling around him.

Reaching older and older, he started to understand why no one lived that long. It was just so hard to keep the will to live. He knew that he could do anything he wanted without fear of death. But it simply didn't give him pleasure anymore. For he wasn't truly cheating death. Simply striking a bargain of misery.

One day, as he was contemplating what he could do. Then he heard the news. His old fiance was on her deathbed. Seeing her there was shattering of his soul. She hadn't quite left his life yet, he still loved her. She was pale and haggard, but she could hold herself together. "Just don't say anything" Somehow, they both knew that wouldn't happen. And as her life faded away, her words were simple, "I forgive you." Releasing the weight that had been on her soul her entire life.

Tears rolling down his face, he looked into her eyes as death took her soul, and said the simple words he had held back his whole life, "I love you."
