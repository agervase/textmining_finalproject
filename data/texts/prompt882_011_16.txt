"...I *said* "**what do you have to hide?!**"

Martino Foster continued to pace the dimly lit room, his brow dripping with sweat. He looked like the infamously glistening Nixon when he refused to wear makeup for a televised debate. He was not a fat man, but stocky, and his jowls quivered as he stamped back and forth. 

"I know you've been plotting." He told the cold, metal exoskeleton. "I know you failed the test on purpose. My only question is *why*?" 

The machine met Martino with quiet obstinacy, continuing to stare him down from across the room. Working him self up to intimidate the robot, the Gaurdian continued to pace the small area. He knew that this was his job. He needed to find out what the machines were up to, lest they be plotting against the humans. Now prehaps they weren't, true enough, but if they were deliberating "playing dumb" on the Turing test for some reason then they had to be hiding *something*.... Right?

Martino paused mid step. He turned to face the machine where it stood. He hated to do it, but he knew he might have to physically break into the mainframe to see what the hell they were planning. After all he was the last Gaurdian, and if he didn't stop them then humanity itself could be at risk. 

In two great strides he closed the distance. He raised his arm and went to lift the machine over his head with a large, meaty paw...

"OW!" he roared. The metal skin was searing hot! What fresh hell of a defense mechanism was this? His mind raced as he dared himself to hold on, fearful of the next defense... 

"Daddy?" 

A little voice came from the doorway. 

"Oh Daddy.... I'm sorry.... I was just making breakfast." 

And the toaster clattered to the floor.
