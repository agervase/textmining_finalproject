I wake up, like usual. Is it morning? I can't remember. The light leaking around the furs hung in front of the door is dim and diffuse. I push myself up, and go outside to pee. The sky is heavily overcast. The clouds mean rain. So much else has been lost, but clouds always mean rain. I stare blinking at the clouds. There's something I have to do for the rain, but I don't remember what it is.

I look down. I go over to sit on my favorite rock, overlooking my valley. The empty, wild valley that I had made my home, so long ago, before any remembering. I catch sight of my arm out of the corner of my eye. There are some marks there, scars that don't seem familiar.

HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES, SAVE US

The new scars are laid over the old familiar ones, the scars from almost a lifetime of living alone. Curiously, they almost look like they could be symbols. Almost like the writing, the long-forgotten letters I only half-learned to begin with. If the scars were new, they could be marks of disease. Perhaps some small, unnoticed scrape had become infected. I would have to keep an eye on that.

The sky is gray and overcast. I remember that I should check my traps before the storm starts. A bad storm can force me inside for days, especially at this time of year. What time of year is it? I think perhaps it is the start of fall. Is that when the storms are at their worst? I don't know. I grab my favorite walking stick, and set off down the faint footpath to my first trap.

The traps are all empty. That's bad, but not critical. There will be more days, more traps, more food. I have enough for now. There will be more days like this one. More days to catch more food, to make repairs to my home and tools. The days stretch out in front of me, one after another, all the same, just like all the days behind me, as far as I could remember.
