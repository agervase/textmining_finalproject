“What’d ya mean? The new guy Sal. Look at the new guy, Otto. Don’t you notice anything weird about him?” 
“4 rows down, wearing his trench coat perpetually. You don’t see that?”

She groaned and moved the chair behind. exhaling deeply” Yea, I know what you mean. He so doesn’t belong here.”

“What? No. No. No!” 
“What are you talking about? Otto? The guy, he isn’t human. It’s just a bunch of otters in a trench coat.” 
“Someone’s idea of a practical joke. Unlucky for them, he or she really, picked an unobservant unambitious lot of idiots who couldn’t tell apart the zeros in a million from ten, or worse, didn’t really care.”

“I knew it was going to take something totally out there to throw him off his game. I saw him walk out, brow bent, worried, paying no attention to the soggy carpet.”
