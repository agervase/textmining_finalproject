"I don't get it. Why would anyone walk away from you?" I questioned the beautiful woman as she looked deeply into my eyes as if she felt even the slightest amount of attraction toward me like I did her. 

"Everyone sees what they feel. I cant help what they see." The statement perplexed me. What they wanted? What else could they see, and if it was so different from mine then what did it look like to them?

"You truly are beautiful.... I am at a loss for words. I wish I could explain it but my breath just seems to disappear. I am sorry. Please believe me." I couldn't help myself. I was entranced. I've never felt such a strong attraction to anyone in my entire twenty one years on this earth. 

"That is an amazing feeling every time I hear it. So welcoming. So.... ready. It's beautiful in itself. I hear it every so often, but it never gets old." The woman stroked my cheek, and my desire grew stronger as I felt my body shiver and grow weak. 

"I want to spend forever with you. Please, just give me your name and I will treat you better than you've ever been treated!" It was such a strange rush of emotions. I stood atop the freeway just 10 minutes ago ready to jump. I was so ready to welcome my death and be gone from this disgusting world, but I finally found something, someone worth spending time here. 

"Oh, you will spend forever with me. You are exactly what I was looking for." She slowly closed her eyes and leaned in, kissing me. I remember nothing else before waking up to this. It's dark, and cold here. It looks like my room, but grey and silent. I miss her.
