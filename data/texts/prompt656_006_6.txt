"Sir, I'm going to need you to put your hands up." The officer was younger than me. God, he was shaking as he pointed his gun at me and all I could think was that if I gulped too loud, he might splatter my brains.

"I'm putting my hands up. Slowly." I said, slowly pulling my hands out of my leather jacket and creeping them towards the sky.

The kid glanced over at the body on the ground and tried to swallow his bile. I tried not to be offended. It was my third victim in the last hour and I thought I'd been pretty careful with keeping the gore down. Just because you're killing people doesn't mean you need to be a slob. He kept eyeing me like he expected something to happen. "T-turn around and put your hands on the wall." I complied.

I could hear the clink of cuffs as he tried to juggle keeping a gun on me with preparing to handcuff me. He jerked my left arm down and snapped the first cuff around my wrist.

"What kind of monster are you?" His breath was close enough I could feel the heat across the back of my neck.

I favored him with more of an answer than he deserved. "I really don't know yet..."

He should have paid more attention to my lower body. While my legs stayed still, my tail slithered out from under my leather jacket. The tip was mostly bone and sported an incredibly sharp barb. When it first came in, I'd scratched the back of my hand with it from a casual brush. With went through the guy's chest like a knife through hot butter. I laughed as I pulled my barb back out and his chest made suction noises. He'd resisted more in death than he had in life.

"But I really am looking forward to finding out." I finished.

I glanced at the XP bar on the back of my hand. The last few droplets filled and a 5 flashed above it before it emptied out. I waited to discover what this level added.
