"What do you have there young Padawan?"

"Nuthin masta, I aint got nuthin"

"Don't lie to me BOY!"

"Don't call me boy, I'm a fully grown man..."

"I'm sorry, sometimes when I'm mad I become insensitive, please forgive me Bobby."

"I haven't gone by that name for a long time-"

"Then what the hell do I call you!?"

"My new name is Chelsea, I'm transitioning so please refer to me as that."

"Into a girl?"

"No, I'm transitioning into a becoming a bigger man, more manly than any one man or woman has ever been!"

"And you chose to name yourself Chelsea?"

"Sue wasn't available."

"Well... I'm glad we got that out of the way, did you find any movies in this pile of trash on this trash planet?"

"No, but I found this shiny circle with the word 'sega' on it-"

"Throw it away! Sega is Garbage!!!"

"Masta, what is a Sega!?"

"NOTHING! Throw it away!!! It's the reason why this planet has become a big pile of trash!!!"

"I feel like I need a little bit more information on this, this seems like it's vital in progressing this story line-"

"How many times do I have to remind you not to break the 4th or 5th wall!!!"

"Sorry reader, it's the last time I promise."

"It better be, now go back and edit this!"

"I can't edit this text without deleting everything..."

"STOP IT!!! The more you- nevermind! It's too late! You ripped a hole in space time!!!"

"Awe man... again?"

"It's that time of day when we have to jump into a new reality with a whole new set of rules and physics and do this whole thing over again! Damnit!!!"

"We have to start at the big bang again?"

"Yes, it'll take Billions of years before there will even be solid ground in the universe!!!"

"I'm going to take this Sega CD and leave it for potential lifeforms to find and admire."

"Alright... are you ready Boy?"

"Chelsea... it's Chelsea. And yes, I'm ready."

"Let's go... and you better not bring that Sega CD for chrisakes!"

"This was a mistake doing this."

"I know"
