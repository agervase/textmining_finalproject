A long time ago criminals of horrendous crimes were given a term of “life in prison”. Then scientists created the perfect solution to overcrowding in the prison system. A drug that would wipe the memories of the inmate, and give them a crueler version of “life in prison.”

The drug was simple, it cleared the memory and reversed the time flow. It would not get rid of things like who your name is (mine’s Maya Flynn), but what you had done. You could call me an expert, I’m one of these lifers’ I was sentenced when I was 28 but the crime I committed was from when I was only 18. I don’t know what I did but going backwards this past decade watching myself get younger and younger has been hard.

Last week I was in solitary for getting into a fight with a security guard this past Tuesday, so was worth it. The guy has and probably always will hit on all female inmates. Next week I’ll finally learn what I did to earn this sentence. Prisoners don’t get to view papers, and I guess even if I could see them I wouldn’t want to ruin the surprise of it.

I will say one thing, I know even though I don’t know what I did but I can guarantee I am either innocent or they deserved it. But I also feel as though I am going nuts, talking to myself, no one cares what I do. My roomers leave me alone I have finally mastered the routine of wake up, eat, do whatever menial chore the guards set before us, eat, visit the library/rec room with non-working TV/yard, eat, pretend to care about whatever the evening’s entertainment, and finally sleep by 9.

At this point the only thing I look forward to is the day I wake up in soft bed. Yeah, I know that once I reach babyhood again, it’s my death. It certainly beats getting old, and dying of something like cancer or old age. I wish I could remember if there are any days that I could change to make my life better but at least I know who I am and what’s happening.
