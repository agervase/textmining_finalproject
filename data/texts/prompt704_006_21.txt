We had been scattered to the night. The waning crescent moon in the sky was a sickly yellow. I couldn't stand to look at it, a mirror to the puss that oozed from my wounds.  The last image of Riley blazing in my head. His eyes transfixed wide, his mouth twisted in terror.

We had left our campsite to search for the elusive Night Blooming Cereus. A strange plant that bloom only for a single day in a year, between June and July. We set out at dusk, leaving the others, who had little interest in our botanical endeavors, to enjoy a night out in nature and a full bottle of whiskey.

About an hour out of camp, we began to hear strange sounds echoing around us. The desert has it's share of beasts who roam the nights, but this sound was not like any we'd heard before. A guttural and ominous sound. Like someone vomiting over the low roar of a lighthouse foghorn. Though the desert was hot tonight, we froze in our tracks.

I looked to Riley to comment on the strange sound, but before I could speak, I saw the terror in his face. Turning from him, in the distance lurking between the Joshua trees, I could make out shapes sulking towards us. Reluctantly, I pointed my flashlight in their direction. The horror I saw then was unimaginable. Five men, in tattered border patrol uniforms. Those who had eyes, had the eyes of the blind. The light reflected off them, showing milky pools of endless depths. The jaws of some, hung open, torn and broken, stretched beyond physical possibilities. The strange sound emanating from them.

Riley ran. At his movement they began to charge at us. I tried to run, but stumbled over twisted brambles and landed hard on my face. I tried to stand. The screams of the dead rattling, an ancient, forgotten cadence enchanting the air around me. I smelled the stench of decay as they fell upon me.

I felt the teeth of a ghoul sink into my arm. A searing pain screaming through me. Adrenaline taking over. I knock the fiend back into his corrupt brethren. I run, screaming,  unsure of the direction I'm heading in.

As I wander through the desert, I can feel a heat spreading from the bite. A black widow spinning a web of hot light through my veins. My vision starts to double, as I look away from the sinister yellow sickle that hangs in the void above. Is that laughter I hear?

I follow the sound for a few minutes and begin to see a flickering flame ahead. This is our camp. I can hear Riley and voices I don't recognize.

As I get closer. My vision, blurred, my mind confused. Camouflaged Humvees circle our campsite. Riley must have spotted me. "Travis! I'm so glad you're okay." I open my mouth to try to say something back but my jaw hangs. Locked in position, panicking I realize I can't close it.

"Travis! You won't believe it? Those things we saw? It's some kind of disease! The army is here and they have a cure!"

A cure. Thank God. I'm saved.

I run towards the Riley. Yelling in excitement, my voice sounds strange but I don't care, I'm going to make it.

A deafening crack throws me backwards. A bloom of crimson streams out of my chest as I crash to the ground.

I'm laying on my side, trying to roll to my back, but something within me has broken and I can't seem to move. Struggling to find focus in my vision, I see it. Out of the darkness, a white angel opening her wings to me. Cereus, Queen of The Night. She blooms for me.
