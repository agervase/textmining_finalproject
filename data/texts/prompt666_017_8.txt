Before you read, I misunderstood the prompts as having the two habitable areas moving around the planet instead of the planet rotating underneath. So hopefully this is still worth a read ;)

Grug stepped slowly, carefully, in parallel with his lead-brothers. While he could not vocalize it, he could sense the unease mounting in the group. The familiar brushfloats, which came off the shrubs and rushed ahead in the breeze, had all but left many sleep-cycles ago. Sleep had not been easy, as a chilling wind has picked up which cut right through their tough poryp hide-covers and leathery, sun-washed skin. Even the great one was abandoning them, slipping ever so closer to the horizon, threatening to leave them without it's presence. Even so, as a lead-brother, it was his charge to continue forwards and mark the path for his tribe. There was no way to turn back; that path only lead to waste and destruction. 

The brother on the right stopped and pointed forwards. Instinctively, Grug raised his club in anticipation of a sand-crawler, or even worse, a dune wurm. However, no scratching or rumbling could be heard. Carried from above by the cold wind came a storm of white, nameless specks. They had a tough walk ahead.

Garron inspected his rusting spearpoint. Surface iron had not been seen in years, and much of the tools and weapons were in dire need of repair. The caravans rolled in behind him, the brushweave sails carried over the sands by the steady wind and strong arm of the rudderbearer. A fastidious lead-brother, he scanned the sands for the tell-tale trenches of a sandwurm, or the sand-crawler trails which inevitably lead to the next oasis. All that caught his vision was a tuft of... his remembered this word... fur. Although he was not the tribe's teller, as a child he still learned the tales of the Mammons, great hairy beasts which rivaled the wurms in size. That, of course, was in the past. The teller had said that the great dark was not of our lifetimes, and it was only our charge to carry the knowledge and tales of our ancestors for when the great dark would come again.

Coming up to the tuft, Garron swept away the hot sand to reveal more of the odd texture. A few loose corners flipped around, exposed to the breeze. Whatever it was, it was thin. Grasping a corner, he pulled the material up, revealing an odd, hooded garment covered in the fur. While it could, conceivably, be worn by someone his size, the material was old and patchy, and in some places so bare it resembled his poryp hide clothes. Surely, the teller would know what this puzzling item was.

Gregory surveyed the dark snows below, feeling the low rumbling of the moving platform beneath him. Lead-Brother was more of a ceremonial role, passed down through generations. He at least did not understand why they couldn't just provide him with a forward-facing window so he could watch from the comfort of inside. At forty-five, all he had ever known was the dark side of the planet. His father would always reminisce of his childhood on the light side, and of the warm sands and bright day. The pictures and video never seemed to live up to the tale, and Gregory thought the boilers in the lower decks were just perfectly fine.

Today he did have an important job though. The "solar batteries" were finally giving way.  Not that his dad's "sun" amounted to much, since 90% of the energy intake was already provided by the wind. Irregardless, the batteries were needed on days when the wind did not blow, and luckily they had the heating towers of his ancestors to convert into electricity. Dug deep into the ground, the towers were once used for warmth, but were now strategic geothermal refueling stations for the convoy. He could see an outline up ahead through the snow, but it did not look much like the previous towers. Coming into view, he could see the billow of smoke rising up from the rubble. Something was wrong.
