"The world trembled in fear, The nukes finally came. As families at home huddled inside of makeshift bunkers, people in the public were either running in fear or taking advantage of the situation, people fought their bosses at work, otherwise, men of reason started rampaging, killing countless, in the name of fun before the seemingly inevitable end. Those that came to peace with their death in firey radioactive mushroom clouds cracked open beers, poured expensive wines, lit final cigarettes, and simply waited.

It was time, the estimated time of impact had arrived, in the centers of Washinton D.C, Moscow, London, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, and Pyeongyang, Bombs had hit the concrete, people near the bombs stood there, in a surreal fear, staring, listening to the eerie 'Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep' many of them ran, some of them too paralyzed to do anything...

These bombs never detonated.
3 weeks later, world leaders approached their podiums, shameful, fearful, and feeling smaller than ants.

Their message was each clear, similar, and sorrowful. '3 weeks ago, we had phoned calls, dialed codes, turned keys and pushed buttons for nuclear annihilation, the horror and sorrow felt from this mistake was felt through the whole of the Earth. this will no doubt spark heavy controversy, utter chaos reigned through the streets in the between times, in mere hours, we've seen human nature come through, society seemed to collapse, however, by some miracle, it hasn't. this is God giving us another chance, to end the conflict between each other. to hold each other in close relations, and to reduce chances of events similar to this happening ever again.'

These leaders eventually stepped down, Elections were held, though few people attended, people were still elected.

In an ironic twist of fate, world peace came from near global warfare."
