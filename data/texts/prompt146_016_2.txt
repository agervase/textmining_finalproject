This was the third and last attempt Bob was willing to make. The previous two couples therapists had done nothing but to entrench the resentment between him and Claire, and he wasn't even sure why he'd allowed himself to be dragged into yet another bland, boring therapist's office. 

"... and don't get me started on the division of chores in the house! I work too, you know!" His wife of fifteen years was harping on, going through the same offences, real and perceived, as with the past two therapists. He sunk deeper into the couch, trying to remember the last time they even had sex.

The therapists office looked about the same as the previous two, with the same odd local variations upon a theme. Beige walls. Nondescript carpet. A two-seater leather couch that Claire and him somehow managed to sit apart in. Who even was this guy? Bob vaguely remembered seeing "Dr. something something" on the way in. A psychiatrist must be. That would explain the anatomical skeleton to the rear of the room. That's a doctor thing, right? Anyway, what difference would it make. 

"... ever since he switched jobs, he's been working himself to the ground! What about us!" Bob felt himself sinking deeper into the sofa, as if weighed down by every word. He only got the job after the interest on the mortgage went up, so they could keep the family home. He had to work those hours! Not that it seemed to matter though.

"Bob, what does this make you feel?" The direct question whipped him out of his thoughts. He was taken aback by the deep, melodious voice emanating from the frail-looking professor type in the chair opposite them. He had never expected the old geezer, looking like some half-vulture with the beaky nose and the bald pate, to have such a voice. "Well... ehm, uhm, you see" Bob didn't even get started before his wife cut him off "Like I said! He's never really present!" Why did he even bother trying.

A truck must have passed outside just then, as the headlights shone through the room casting a glare across the face of Dr. who-even-cares anymore. Even the doc seemed bored, mumbling under his breath. Bob leaned back and for the first time since they sat down looked over at his wife. *His wife*. His. Wife. Funny that. He couldn't remember the last time the thought of Claire being his wife tugged like that, somewhere down in his pauch. And how come she was looking at him like that? The room was quiet as the couple just sat in the sofa looking at each other. Bob couldn't even remember the last time they had just sat together, looking each other in the eyes like that. Somehow, even the sofa felt smaller. Instinctively he put his arms around his wife, and it was as if he could almost feel her shoulders lowering and he heard the sigh escaping from her. Dr. whatever looked at them, his dry, pale hands steepled in front of his face.

"Although... Now that I think about it, we couldn't have kept a home like we do. Not without the hours he's pulled." Bob could hardly believe it. And at the same time a tremendous feeling of guilt washed over him. The long hours, the honestly fair requests for more of his presence in their joint lives, how he had in a sense signed out of it all. "... he really does go to every length for us. That's why I've always felt so safe with him." It was as if he saw her, his wife, *his wife*, for the first time in ages. The sparkle in her eyes when she looked at him put goosebumps on his arms. He pulled her closer and knew in his core that he just wanted to hold her close and be with her. Bob looked at the doc and suddenly blurted out "I think we're done here. I think we need to get home. We've been through tough times before, but somehow I just have a feeling we'll pull through." The look his wife sent him was as full of love and longing as he could ever remember seeing. They got up with urgency, thanking the doctor and apologising for wasting his time, as they saw themselves out. Arms linked around eachother's waists.

As the door closed behind them, the doc wiped the thin trail of blood running from his left nostril. "Good one, doc" said the skeleton as Doctor rubbed his eyes and poured himself a drink.
