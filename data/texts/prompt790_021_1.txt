“Months...” I kept saying to myself “they’ll save me.” For months I continued to believe my friends would save me. But every day the beatings and the torture got worse. It wasn’t until after the first month that the I noticed her. An angel of death, she sat looking and waiting for my death. 

I was shocked at first being able to see her and still not be dead. After several days of her being there I decided to talk to her. But before any words left my mouth the angel spoke to me.

“Kane” the angel spoke softly “why haven’t you died yet?” 

I was baffled to what she said, but she was right. Even though the beatings get worse, I still breath without issue. “Perhaps I’m indestructible” I say with a slight laugh. 

The angel scuffed “and so it may be”

For several more months, so many I’ve lost track. The angel continued to speak to me, every night she began to open up to me. We learned a lot about each other, and how each others worlds work. I even managed to learn her name, Elisa.

Today however was different, the look on her face was different. Her normally vibrant face was now shallow, seemingly void of emotion. Though the time we’ve spent together I know this means she’s upset. But why would she be upset, unless... unless this would be our last day together.

“No!” Elisa shouted, startling me awake from my slumber. Her bright wings extended off her back, phasing through the cramped walls of the cell. She took a step forward and wrapped her arms around me. “I won’t let them take you, not anymore.”

“Elisa what are you doing!?” I coughed as she prepared to jump through the roof.

“Saving the one thing I’ve learned to love.” She softly whispered to me as she jumped and phased both of us through the building. Before I knew it we were high up in the sky, I could see everything. From the beautiful mountain side and the dark grey facility I was kept in.

Soon after our take off we came back down to earth. Elisa let me go and stumbled to the ground. I quickly went to catch her, as her beautiful wrings turned grey. The feathers which were once so pure and white darkened. 

“Elisa what’s happening to you?” My voice broke with fear

“Saving you...” her voice was heavy and her eyes began to tear up “Changing your destiny doomed my own”. 

Elisa’s eyes lost their crystal blue color as they turned grey. Her hair darkened to almost pitch black, and her gown followed suite. 



“When an angel begins to feel love, they are considered fallen. In my case, I fell in love with a man who would eventually destroy the very foundation of civilization.” Elisa peered off into the grey horizon. As cities burned, and people died. “ is this the destiny I sought? Or is this just a reason to change the past.”

The angel smiles as she looks up one final time, to witness the earths final pure moments. As a green light began to envelope the land, and Kane’s true destiny is revealed.
