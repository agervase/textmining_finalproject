"Seeing ghosts, Brandon Banker?"

"Yes, that's why I must be here."

"Not a problem, just sign in here please."

Brandon scribbles his name onto the paper and listens as the front desk explains that there's to be no strings or laces, not even toothbrushes because one of the other residents would find a way to stab themselves with it. "I'm not that crazy," he said.

"Can't say that for the rest of them," she said and gave him the tour and shared times of meals. She also mentioned mild entertainment like movies and a library. "Sometimes you can get a game of poker together, although not sure if most of them likes losing."

She opened one of the doors in the hallway. "Your room."

"Ahh, thank you..." He mumbled and stepped inside. It was a bland room, empty save for a bed and an empty shelf. It was cold, and musty, too musty. Still he laid on the hard springs, least until one of them stabbed into his shoulder.

The pain brought him back to reality. He was in a mental institution, one that hadn't been running for years. And he hadn't asked the ghost woman her name, "Nurse!" he called instead.

The filthy stone walls became clean and the spring bed had its covers once more.

"Yes?" she asked.

"You're dead."

"No, it's your mind playing tricks on you again."

"I'm not, you're a ghost!" Brandon pointed at the bed, which in his sights was back to exposed springs. "I can prove it, try leaving the building."

"But what about Dr. Mathus, and everyone inside?"

"All ghosts, making an illusion so real that you're likely got a few live victims in here, come. I'll prove it to you."

Instead she shut the door and locked it. "When you're calmed down, we'll give you a proper eval, okay?"
