Mark yawned, stretching after a quick, but weirdly refreshing nap in class. He tensed up, just realizing it was one of *those* classes, where a sign of relaxation is met with a bad grade for "Slacking off".

But he did not receive a punishment. He saw all his colleauges and the teacher at the window on his left. They were all very confused about something and Mark had to know what happened.

"Maybe that grade 6 kid made a scene again," Mark chuckled and started pushing through the crowd.

Instead of seeing a spoiled brat crying his eyes out to not get in trouble, for punching someone else, he saw that his classroom, and only his classroom, walls and all, is inside another room he could describe like a giant bunker. It was at least a hundred meters long, wide and twenty tall. His classroom was a tenth of the bunker's size and it made Mark feel very small and trapped.

He hurried to the door with a pair of other students and the strongest of them kicked it open and they ran out, out of panic. The door fell from it's rusted hinges and the sound echoed through the concrete room. Mark could now see a big pair of steel blast doors, on the opposite side of the bunker the class window was pointing to. Above the doors was a twenty meter long wall of glass, blurred to try hiding the moving shadows on the other side.

Sirens started blaring and spinning, the blast doors started creaking and opening, and Mark could do nothing but stand still in pure shock. Almost all students were already outside, but some regretted their decision and ran back inside the classroom.

A group of armed men, about twenty of them, came out of the doors in a hurry with weapons pointing at the students, yelling at them to put their hands on their head and lie on the ground.

From the blast doors came a muffled sound of an announcement: "*SCP 8352* class elevated to, *EUCLID*..."

It was all Mark could hear before being hit on the head by an armed man.
