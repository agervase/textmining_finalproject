Arthur walked into his kitchen... and stopped. His brow furrowed.


He was pretty certain that he'd cleaned up after himself last night. He was also reasonably sure that of all the pastries in all of the world, scones were his least favorite. Which was why right now, he was wondering who had broken into his house in the middle of the night and left a scone on a plate on his countertop - complete with clotted cream and strawberry jam in jars to one side.


Planted deep in the top of the scone was an unreasonably polished butter knife that glinted in the light as he approached.


As he got closer, he could hear it. The air was filled with a gentle concert-pitch drone... a reverberation that rang like a finger drawn around the rim of a wine glass.


He grabbed the knife by the handle - which instantly stopped humming, leaving the kitchen eerily quiet - and slid it out of the pastry in one smooth motion.


He opened his pedal bin and dropped the scone off its plate into it. He'd save the jam and clotted cream for later.


He put the knife away in his cutlery drawer, and closed it behind him.

Years later, scholars would disagree on whether or not these events marked the decline of Great Britain, or if it was something more mundane - a soft, hard, or dappled Brexit. Arthur had refused the call. Luckily, fate often calls multiple times, like a telemarketer with a quota to fill.


Meanwhile, somewhere deep under the ground just outside of Macclesfield, the ground began to shake. Alderley Edge wasn't particularly known for its seismic activity. But it was known for one thing - the final resting place of the Knights of the Round Table, and Merlin, waiting for when Avalon would need to be defended from its greatest enemies ... who were about to arrive.
