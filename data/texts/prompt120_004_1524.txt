I couldn’t understand why he was smiling. I watched as my father looked around almost uncertainly before setting the jug of milk on the counter. There was no apology in his smile. There was only the same warmth I remembered as a boy when he watched me score a goal in soccer. Nonetheless it did nothing to diffuse the rage rumbling inside of me. 
  “What are you doing here?” I snapped. My father’s smile falters for a moment. 
  “This is my house, son. I guess I don’t understand the question.” He rubbed the black stubble on his chin. 
  “No,” I practically launched myself up from the kitchen table. “This is my house! I inherited it almost 25 years ago when Mom died. Remember her? The woman you left?” 
The calm never left his gaze as he picked the milk back up and placed it inside the refrigerator. 
“You’re a piece of shit,” I snarled. “How dare you show your face here?” I watched him and the confusion finally set in. Not a single gray hair was on his head. No wrinkles. In fact, he was wearing the exact same red flannel shirt I last saw him in. My father leaned up against the wall. A calendar grazed the top of his head. 
   Normally an even-tempered man myself, I was becoming crushed under the heat of volcanic disdain. I charged my father and slammed my fists into his chest. 
  “Do you have any idea what you’ve done to me? What you’ve done to Mom? She was never the same after you left! I was never the same! I looked up to you! I hate you!” I pounded his chest. “I hate you! I hate you!” 
Amidst my incoherent screaming I suddenly froze. The massive bear arms of my father wrapped around me. 
  “Oh, son. Will you forgive me?” 
   I couldn’t breathe. The weight of hate filled years melted away under the even heavier weight of my farther’s arms. 
  “Yes,” my own whisper woke me. I opened my tear blurred eyes. I blinked away the dream and saw the inside of my father’s house.
