"So...you change hair color. Congratulations, you're the richest woman in the world." His voice was lax and sardonic, words that described him. His feet were up on his desk with a hand behind his head, while the other held a book. Glasses were midway down his nose as he never looked at her.

"You know what this means, don't you?" she replied with gritted teeth. "People could finally take you seriously, Apollo. People would LISTEN." Her hair, jet black without a strand of blonde, displayed her brilliance. She was always correct, always on top of things--except her brother.

With a sigh, her closed his book. "Artemis, look," he said, letting loose his hair: bright blonde, save for a single lock above his left eye. He wasn't stupid in even the slightest manner. His intelligence was equal to his twin's, but his head was in the clouds. "I'm a writer. I write fantasy of all things, and I talk out loud to focus my ideas." He took a fistful of his long hair and shook it. "All I say are nonsensical, stupid-seeming things. The people who read my work aren't looking for black-haired genius; they're looking for something to take them out of the real world."

"Just--can't you do this for me?" Artemis finally pleaded. "You're so smart, you always have been. I hate when people talk down to you."

"It doesn't bother me," he replied, putting his feet on the floor. "Honestly, I encourage it. Puts those pompous fucks in their place, which pleases me immensely." Apollo smiled at her. "Artemis Sinclair, world renowned biochemist, inventor of hair dye. Just another notch in your belt."

She smiled, despite herself. "Apollo Sinclair, world renowned fantasy author and blonde. You're infuriating, you know that, right?"

"Yes, and it's behavior you have only encouraged."
