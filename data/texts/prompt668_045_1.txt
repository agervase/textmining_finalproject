You are told that beyond this door is the person you hurt the most. To enter Heaven you must confront this person. Several people come to mind, my father Jack, my ex Christine, or my ex-best friend Ken. But which of them? What will I say? 

I take a deep breath. Close my eyes. Calm the mind. Another breath inward. A deep exhale. I'm ready.

I turn the handle and open the door. I'm confused to see nothing in the room but a mirror. Except that isn't a mirror, it's me. 

"Didn't anyone ever tell you that you are your own worst enemy?" The question is quite obviously rhetorical as he gestures his hand across the room. My eyes follow his motion towards two chairs that most likely just appeared. We walk nearly in unison, except he leads me by at least five steps. We finally sit upon our chairs and gaze at each other.

He again breaks the silence, "How do you think I ended up here over everyone else?" A simple question that cuts to the core of my predicament. Yet, I don't even know how to begin to answer it. After a few minutes in thought I respond with an "I don't know." 

He gives me a sly chuckle and retorts "You always knew more than you thought. In fact you always had more to offer than you thought. Why did you hide yourself from others?" Now it hits me. Those nights of utter loneliness and sadness. The melancholy fog you resided within. 

"Ah now you can see why I am here" responding as if he can read my thoughts (or maybe our thoughts?). "Surely some of that sadness is from your depression, but hey it's a genetic thing I get that. But why didn't you reach out to your friends at the time? Like not even a text? That's what really hurts."

His words hit me like I'm a punching bag. My breaths shallow and challenging. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by guilt. "Please" he begs. "Stop beating yourself up. Now is not the time for that. Now is about understanding why."

"Ok" is the only word I can manage to get out. Deep breath inward. Close my eyes. Exhale. Ok let's try again. Why wasn't I able to reach out to my friends? Was there something else on my mind at the time or "Hello???" He asks breaking my thought. Then it clicks. 

"Well since I don't know why I didn't reach out to my friends. How about I reach out to you - or me i guess, ah whatever - and ask: What was stopping me before?"

He smiles, "now you're getting it. Well to put things simply you were afraid. Afraid of being seen incorrectly or misunderstood. But one thing you overlooked is that if you don't put yourself out there you are by default going to be misunderstood." 

A door appears behind him. We stand in unison and approach the door. I reach for the handle but his hand quickly covers it. "This is a whole new world. But please don't make the same mistake as last time"
