Part 1

Anderson looked at the monitors in front of him and left out a sigh of despair. He could not move his eyes away from the 4 bliking red dots on the nearest monitors. 4 Betapod starships that stood halfway between the earth and the moon, waiting for the ultimatum to pass. Their demand was simple, release the 5 betapod soldiers currently in captivity deep under the area-51 complex and prepare to be liberated by the Betapodian Empire or be destroyed. A reasonable enough demand given the circonstances but the only problem was that of the 5 betapod soldiers, 2 had died on impact when their ship crashlanded back in 1986 and the other 3 had long ago been dissected for studies.

The world security council was collectively wetting their pants in their secret war bunker 2 mile below the surface but so far they could not agree on any course of action. 

Anderson was taken out of his thoughts by the arrival of his young aide.

>Any news from the world security council lieutenant ?

>>Nothing sir, they are still evaluating our options.

>Evaluating our options ? Yeah, right. That's the problem with bureaucrats, they talk and talk away but will wait for you to make a move until they suddently decide that is was exactly what they were about to tell you to do. Bunch of idiots all of them

>>Well, what are our options sir ? We're already at Level 1, all nuclear nations are awaiting a launch order to strike at the betapodians.

>Bah, waste of a good nuke if you ask me. What little we know of Betapodian technology already tells us that we'll never penetrade their shields using conventional warheads. Beside, *HE* would never permit a nuclear launch without his autorisation.

>>He ? What are you talking about sir ?

>Allright, we all knew it was coming to this. Lieutenant, I'm hereby elevating the situation to a Level 0. Get the post-it.

Anderson turned to face the young lieutenant but was only met with a perplex expression of surprise and doubt.

>>Sir, there is no such thing as Level 0 and even if there was, how would a post-it help us ?

Anderson sighted and motioned toward his desk.

>I keep forgetting you're new here lieutenant, you don't know about it yet. In a way I envy you, I miss the innocent old days when I too didn't know. Please go to my desk and retrieve the post-it with a phone number that is on my screen.

The young lieutenant made his way towards the desk and shuffled a few papers around. 

>>Is it the blue one with *Samantha* and XXX written on it ?

>No lieutenant, not that one.

>>The pink one with a flower with *SOX* written on it?

>That’s the one. Bring it here quickly please.

Anderson took up the phone, punched a few numbers and hung up.

>>Sir, what exactly are we doing ?

>Lieutenant, do you knew the story about how the only way to reach Bill Murray is to call a 1-800 number connected to an answering machine ?

>>Yes.

>Well it’s like that but insted of an answering machine it’s an old pager and insted of a wacky free-spirited yet surprisingly deep actor you actually get the sadistic bloddthursty ruler of the world.

>>What ?

>You heard right lieutenant, lets just hope he calls back, we’ll worry about the price later. Whatever happens, let me do the talking, it’s probably best for your sake if he doesn’t know you exist.

After what seemed like an eternity, the phone rang and Anderson answered. He placed the call on speaker phone and an angry old voice was heard.

*Yes ? Who is this ? How did you get this number ?*

>Good evening Supreme Overlord Xandar, it’s General Anderson of Area-51.

*Anderson ?.... Anderson!.... ANDERSON !? You better have a damn good reason for calling me general, you just interupted my evening bubble bath.*

>I’m terribly sorry Supreme Overlord, I sincerely appologize for the inconvenience. It’s just that, we have a situation sir.

*What, again? Seriously general, I let you continue with your little alien freaks prison because it amused me but it’s becoming quite annoying. It irks me and I do not like it.*

>Again sir, I am terribly sorry. You didn’t happen to watch the news today did you sir ?

*You know I don’t bother myself with your low key politics. As long as you don't bother me I leave you alone, that was the deal.*

The young lieutenant was dumbfounded. He was watching one of the most highly decorated military officer of the planet getting talked down by some old man calling himself supreme overlord ? He could keep his silence no longer and left out an amused laugh.
