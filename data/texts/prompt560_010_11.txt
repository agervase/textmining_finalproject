" Wow, it's dark. And wet. And warm. Hell, it's hot in here! "

 I couldn't see a thing. Seemed as if my eyes weren't working, at least not 100% yet. I felt secure yet out of control of my body. I was so pent up, elbows and knees bent and locked in place. Then I felt it, this enormous pressure all around me, pushing down and... and... out.

 I was being born at 34 years old, or should I say, reborn. 

 I wasn't crying for I was so taken aback by the whole process. Everything went from hot to cold. The lights were so bright, the moment I did finally open my eyes, I had to squeeze them shut. When I reopened them, she was there - my mother.

 " Who is this woman? "

 Then yes, then came the nipple. Yeah it's weird but it's crazy good. Don't judge me, I was a baby, again.

 For the first five years or so, it's a bunch of saying " I know, I know " in my head because I didn't come out of the oven with fresh speaking skills. I compare it to those recovering from paralysis, learning how to talk and walk again - I knew how to but my muscles couldn't operate as such. 

 Unlike other kids, I ate my vegetables. " Last time " I was overweight, with a poor diet and not very active. This time around, I took control of what I ate when I could. And playing outside, oh man, how I forgot how much fun and exhausting it can be. 

 Since my mother was raising me alone and working full time, I stayed on my best behavior. Helping were I could, and actually behaved myself. Not to say things were boring this time, are you kidding me? The video game consoles available were way more advance than what I had back then. 

 I aced elementary school, what a great refresher. Middle school was a breeze, kept my nose in the books, even skipped a grade ahead. I held on to my regrets of not giving my all academically, pushing through to high school a year ahead of my friends. 

 Now I'm a 13 year old boy, with the mind of technically a 47 year old, about to set foot on my new school's campus.
