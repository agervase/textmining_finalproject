I didn't break eye contact. My eyes were damp, and it was impossible to find a balance in terms of keeping still. I either slumped over or I held myself so rigid that I trembled, an ache creeping over my body, my muscles too taut.

&#x200B;

Thinking about it briefly, I realized just how useless these things were. We could stand outside the Capitol Building all day, every day and nothing would ever really come of it. These people just couldn't share one iota of care for the rest of us. They would sit in their ivory towers looking down upon us from their golden seats and contemplating our existence; how we could be of more use to them and their cycle of control and greed while forgoing any respect for the earth and its dwindling supply.

&#x200B;

I thought it would be fun to join the others like us and maybe be enough of a societal pressure to accomplish even a little change. Contact was made. Events were enacted. The trigger was pulled. It was a simple idea: choose to be any hero we wanted, and end up joining a movement that would inspire change and bring awareness to the gravity of the situation for the express purpose of saving the world from itself. 

&#x200B;

"Heroes Across the Globe", we called ourselves. And now we are.

&#x200B;

Lucky me, I suppose, that I brought my two friends with me and we stood side by side, hand in hand as a sign of solidarity. If I had known what they would become I would have told them to be something else. Be someONE else. But now I lament my fantasy, knowing that even at the end of this, even if everything goes back to normal they will never be the same again. 

&#x200B;

The awareness kicked in. Like the bucket of ice water dumped on my head when I participated in that one challenge, so long ago. It was sobering. Refreshing. Enticing. I could feel a portion of the crowd as they quickly grew into their personas like I did. I could feel the metal men around me as they immediately went to work building machines that could power our entire civilization for decades. I could feel the same men tinkering with their creations so that they could assert dominance over their brethren to usurp their resources and make an even more efficient machine. Much like the man they imitated, hubris would be their downfall. And much like that same man, it would inspire others to use what they were given to do the same.

&#x200B;

No.

&#x200B;

Not this time. Not again.

&#x200B;

*Stop*, I thought. *That's enough*.

&#x200B;

The ones within my range ceased all motor functions, opening them up to fire from their contemporaries. Most of them fell and didn't get back up.

&#x200B;

The crowd, having recovered from the shock of being gifted, was quickly stunned again by what happened. 

&#x200B;

One, two, three voices shrieked in panic. Their words were unintelligible but they set people into motion as some of them checked on the fallen, others ran towards the red and blue lights, and a few flew up, up, and away faster than a speeding bullet.

&#x200B;

I felt the simmering in my chest. As it rose up it caught in my throat until I almost choked on it. I struggled to open my mouth to let it out but it wouldn't come. I squeezed their hands. My concierge and my seer noticed the squeeze and attempted to assuage my grief only for their personas manifest further. They both went to claw at their eyes, one set glossing over from lack of use and the other slowly burning away until two empty husks remained where his heterochromatic eyes once were; one crystal that always reminded me of what little arctic blue we have left and the other a golden chestnut planted in my mind all the way back from the days when we played outside together as children. Both gone.

&#x200B;

I yanked their hands down to my side and willed them to stay as the release came. More of a warble than anything else but still inhuman sounding all the same.

&#x200B;

For a moment I understood what it must've been like to be him. To be the Lawgiver. The one who saw the waves rippling before him and cast them aside to provide a path for his people to enter promised land.

&#x200B;

Except now all are my people and I promised not land but time.

&#x200B;

I bellowed out to the heavens and I tore open portals around me. A sea of glowing, ivory hexagons outlined with gold rippled out around me, expanding my range and connecting me to the cornucopia of people and powers around me. I felt them and what they could accomplish. The glowing verdant ones, the speedsters, the banishers of the realm of shadows, gods of storms and princesses of forgotten lands, the flexible arachnid ones, the patriots, the cardinal crones, the raging behemoth, boy scouts and honey badgers, the vanta finks, ones who drain by touch, the elemental four, and countless others.

&#x200B;

But it wasn't enough. In order to enact lasting change for our world I would need even more help. So I opened up doors to all the places where our rally was scheduled and witnessed the chaos.

&#x200B;

Formerly unpowered people were suddenly gifted extraordinary abilities and who had no idea why. They didn't know what the trigger was or why, but they saw the opportunity to do something with it and oh boy did they. 

&#x200B;

They were presented with the chance to do good and save the world as promised, and instead they bickered and fought. They peppered the ground with bursts of energy that could level cities if left unchecked. They tossed cars with an ease that would make major league pitchers jealous.

&#x200B;

Chaos. Plain and simple. Just as it had been with the old ones in their ivory towers. 

&#x200B;

No. Not this time. Not again.

&#x200B;

I reached out and threw portals in a wide net, catching most in the process and using what I caught to scrounge up the others.

&#x200B;

I used my seer to remotely scour the globe and found a few minor pockets of capes here and there but with what I amassed so far I felt confident we could do what we set out to do; reverse the damage that we did to the planet and remove the fossils from their seats of power.

&#x200B;

Tears of joy streaked down my cheek that were swept away by the crosswind generated by a landscape of milk and honey portals leading to places normally beyond our reach.

&#x200B;

I took a deep breath, labored as it was.

&#x200B;

I was hoping to bring about change peacefully but I have an army the likes of which has never been seen before and a power that no nation can rival.

&#x200B;

It would have to do.

&#x200B;

This was it. Finally, everyone was working together.
