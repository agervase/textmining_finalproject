“What the hell are you swearing at? Of COURSE this happened, this has been waiting to happen for years! Never use your turn signal, do you? Neeeever bother to look to see if there’s anyone in your blind spot, huh? ‘Oh, durr, I’m David, I don’t need to check my blind spot, hurr durr, other cars will make way for me.’ Well, guess what? I now have hundreds of hours of footage of you being a reckless driver, including the fact that you’re always speeding, AND the fact that you caused this accident, dummy. 

“UGH you are just the WORST driver, always trying to zoom past the big lines of cars and cut in at the front. You think other people like that? You think they don’t have places to go? Why do you think they’re always driving so close to one another when you’re trying to wedge your way in there? Mayyyybe because you’re an asshole? Oh, nooooo, David could never be an asshole, he’s a great driver – a far-above-average driver – and everybody else SUCKS. Yeah. That’s totally what’s going on all the time all over the world. Well, you know what? Maybe if everything always smells like shit, YOU'RE the one who stepped in dog doo.

“Ah, look at you, dumbass, waving your arms like that, trying to make it out to be that other driver’s fault. Who merged into who, David, huh? You just couldn’t stand to wait those thirty extra seconds it would’ve taken, nooooo, you just had to try to jump the line. Thank God this piece of shit car will finally be off the road – minor blessing considering you’re probably just gonna borrow your mom’s car and be back out here next week. Well, I hope that other driver takes you to the cleaners and your insurance rates go so high you have to take a bus!”
