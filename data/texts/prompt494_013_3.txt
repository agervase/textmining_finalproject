"So i resisted. Apparently death has a weakness. And I survived so I came here".

"I dont believe you"

He took of his shirt

Just below where his heart should be there was a big, scary looking scar. It was long and wide, but looked old.

"I've been on the run ever since. You see, you cant really kill DEATH. He chased me for 20 years and I think he's close."

So he stayed. He was greatful but a little full of himself. I guess you can expect that crom someone that tricked DEATH himself.

Than one night it happend.

I was swimming im the lake near my housr. It was the only farm around so no one else was there. I dont know why but siddenly I felt dissy, I started breathing heavily, drinking more and more water... As i fainted, all I could see
Was that smile.
That faceless smile.
my heart stopped for a second. Apparently that was enough... 


where am I was the first thing that I asked myself. It was dark, only dark, like beeing blind and seeing yourself from a 3rd person at the same time.

I HAVE A PROPOSITION said a voice.
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU DIED. I saw the smile again. And then i saw him. DEATH in his all magesty, with his scyth in one hand, no face, just smile, like he wanted to greet the dead.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT BELONG TO ME. SOMEONE. GIVE ME THE MAN YOURE HIDING, AND IN RETURN YOU WILL GET YOUR LIFE.

I think making a deal with DEATH is better than making a deal with Satan. Because Satan doesnt kill you right away, he plays with you. He never kill you, but owns you instead. DEATH is fair. He just kills you.

So i did. And all it took was stopping my heart for one seacond during dinner. A little drug that I give my cows did the trick, and DEATH appeare behind the man who managed to trick him. One slash and they both were gone.  20 years that man was outsmarting him, 20 years he was a god. And all it took was one second. Apparently that was enough...
