Private Cannell: But Sir, couldn't we have just used our bayonets instead of these awkward things?

Sgt Gibbins: General Kett doesn't want to risk it. If you had your bayonet you'd also have your rifle, and he's not going to let you two muppets be the reason big Kim nukes Seoul.

Private Cannell: But why am I the one with the spear, Sir? Raisin's got a scimitar. I want a scimitar.

Sgt Gibbins: Raisin's only got a scimitar because he got his spear stuck in a tree, and we're not going to send him in with nothing. We're not Russia. Now get back on duty. The catapult's not going to find its own rocks. 

Private Cannell: And that's another thing, Sir. Kim only said he'd fire his nukes if we fired bullets. A missile isn't a bullet. An F15 isn't a bullet. A grenade isn't a bullet. Couldn't we have at least been issued grenades, sir? 

Sgt Gibbins: Shut up Private. A missile is a type of bullet, a F15 fires missiles, and a grenade… well… Look, the guys in Washington know a lot more than you do, and get paid a lot more than you do to make these decisions.

Now, unless you want to discuss an 18 month sentence in military jail, you'll find me som- PRIVATE RAISIN, WILL YOU STOP SWINGING THAT BLOODY SWORD AT THAT BLOODY TREE.

Private Raisin: It's a Scimitar, si-

Sgt Gibbins: I KNOW IT’S A SCIMITAR. GET IT OUT OF THAT TREE. 

Private Raisin: Yes, sir … Oh… It's stuck, sir.

Sgt Gibbins: WHAT DO YOU MEAN ITS STUCK?!

Private Raisin: It's lodged in the tree, sir.

Sgt Gibbins: I KNOW WHAT STUCK MEANS. 

Private Cannell: Sir. If we're going to use siege weapons, why aren't we at least using Trebuchets? They've got a further range and ar-

*VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*

The three looked up in unison at the fleet of British planes, as they flew over their heads. 

Sgt Gibbins: Don't say it, Cannell. Don't you dare bloody say it.
