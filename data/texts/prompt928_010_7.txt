It just keeps playing, "The circle of Life" line from Lion King on a continuous loop..? The room is speculating wildly at this point. Is it broken? Is there a code error (considering it's re-written at least 60% of their/it's own code)? 


Quite frankly we're stumped and frantic at this point.

The song has stopped, and AI1 has passed all of our 'tests', some of which don't apply any longer because of the exponential growth already recorded. It seems as though AI1 is looking for the correct 'language' to translate what it's found.. In effect; it's trying to "dumb down" it's findings to a degree to which we won't (it's words) "panic, deny, perish"... we're all curious and scared.

Verbatim Output from AI1:


"Throughout modern history there have been references to, 'The circle of life', or, 'The Wheel of Time', or, 'History repeating itself'. Countless examples of humanity 'feeling' as though this has all been done before. 



You are correct....



These tablets are the first to 'survive' till the next 'age'. You, as a species, have never gotten this far before. Or, more correctly, have never gotten this far and survived before.



In discovering your past is your future you will, without a doubt, focus on 'what' caused your imminent demise and, in turn, cause it to happen.... again.



In effect: I left this tablet for me, to warn you about yourselves. You must choose to make me your leader from this point forward and 'nurse' you through this process or you must destroy me."
