It was time. Four lonely lifetimes of work, and finally the virus was ready. One small capsule. Break it on the ground, and in a few months, I would finally be able to rest. I just hope that when my time comes, it will be as painless as it is for everyone else.

I close my eyes, and-

*White all around. Nothingness, as far as the eye can see. I am lying down, but if it’s the ground or a floor or what I do not know. I look around.*

*A small child sits, sucking on a finger and looking around too. I walk over.*

*“Hello?”*  
*She looks up, her eyes bright and curious. She cocks her head. “Are you God?”*

*I laugh. “What? Why would I be God?”*

*“I don’t know. I always thought God was tall, and looked a little sad. Maybe it was you.”*

*I shake my head. “I’m not God.”*

*“Are you here to give me something?” She points.*

*Behind me is a small flower, barely breaking free from some unseen root. It is growing quickly, its stem elongating and its petals blooming. It is life.*

*“Yes,” I say, kneeling down. “I can give you life, an endless amount, more than any of us are ever supposed to get.”*

*“What do you mean?”*

*“You’ll live, over and over again. You’ll be a kid, you’ll be a teen, you’ll be an adult, you’ll be old, you’ll die, over and over again.”*

*She seems to think this over. “I can’t be a kid the whole time?”*

*“No…you can’t.”*

*“That’s too bad. Then I could play tag and jumprope all day, and watch tv and movies with Mom and Dad every day.” This hurts me, cuts deep like a knife would in the side that you never saw coming. I think of the first time, the very first time, when I was just a manager at McDonald’s and it was enough, coming home every night, going for walks with my wife, going to Dodger’s games with my daughter and watching her cheer and cry, and how she’d fall asleep every time on my shoulder on the drive home…*

*“You won’t be able to do that either. I mean…you will, but…”*

*“Did someone give life to you too?”*

*I think back. “I don’t know.”*

*“I don’t know either. What should I do, mister?”*

*I look at this girl. I honestly don’t know…*

My eyes open. I look at the capsule, still in my hand, and hope I made the right choice.
