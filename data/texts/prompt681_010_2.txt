".....I wonder..."

#Century 1400 (1476)
"How can you exist for so long?"
&nbsp;

"Its a gift...want to spend some of it? We can go to your old place...what was it called? Vinci...Leonardo?"
&nbsp;

"Vinci, yes. Can you help me with these sketches?"
&nbsp;

"of course..."

#Century 1600 (1699)
"Cruval...come on..."
&nbsp;

"You sailed these seas with an iron fist with gold pouring in droves! don't tell me you don't want to go back out there?"
&nbsp;

"I do! But even I need a bit of rest."
&nbsp;

"Thatch...Edward, a royal pardon just means a second chance at greatness, to see what is really out there!"
&nbsp;

"And what about that *Immortal Council* of yours? My men won't be young forever making sure they don't find you...I will grow old-"
&nbsp;

"And I want to be there! At least till your adventure ends."
&nbsp;

"...got another pint?"
&nbsp;

"of course..."

#Century 1800 (1862)
"Does this speech look alright?"
&nbsp;

"Abraham...we've been over this! It looks FINE...it has all the trappings of a great leader AND...a good point."
&nbsp;

"Almost seems long lasting?"
&nbsp;

"Exactly!"
&nbsp;

"Timeless?"
&nbsp;

"YE-what?"
&nbsp;

"Timeless...like a certain group of-"
&nbsp;

"Not this again!"
&nbsp;

"They might actually get it this time...most certainly-"
&nbsp;

"Never even try...they NEVER try...too stuck in the then to come to the NOW..."
&nbsp;

"So why don't you bring them?"
&nbsp;

"They continue to look down on your species, why should I?"
&nbsp;

"It must be pretty lonely there..."
&nbsp;

"It never seems like they care..."
&nbsp;

Abraham walks towards the door...crowds murmur on the outside.
"Lincoln? Good Luck!"
&nbsp;

"Thanks...try not to spoil it like last time?"
&nbsp;

"Those slavers were asking for it!"
&nbsp;


#Century 1900 (1963)
"Your going to change the WORLD, just like I did!"
&nbsp;

"My name has king in it but that doesn't mean I am going to rule like one."
&nbsp;

"No problem! I'll do it, no one will know."
&nbsp;

"Cruval...the council has been showing up on the outskirts of these marches...are you sure they won't interfere?"
&nbsp;

"I am, its not like they care about your troubles, only theirs...and to take me down..."
&nbsp;

"But-"
&nbsp;

"Martin...its alright. Go do what you were practically born to do. Give people a reason to dream!"
&nbsp;

"...alright...but if I do not see you after this is all over-"
&nbsp;

"Don't worry, I have a plan...now go out there!"
&nbsp;

Assured footsteps can be heard walking towards a obelisk...a sea of people can be seen across and near the podium...
&nbsp;

"I have a Dream, that one day-"
&nbsp;

A ruckus in the background...
