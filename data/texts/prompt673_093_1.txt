She twiddled her thumbs, and then remembered she wasn’t supposed to move – but that only lasted a few moments before the twiddling resumed.  He would find her eventually.  Their game had persisted for time unending, and though she had never truly lost he had taken much from her.  

There was no longer the brilliance of a star behind which she could conceal her own light; no longer the flap of a wing to veil her own breathing; no longer the steps of men to hide the ever present beating of her heart.  She was the last, and he was getting closer.

All the distractions had exceeded her expectations.  The magic of the ocean kept his fancy for eons, and as her creations evolved they had kept his interest.  Perhaps the greatest diversion she was able to summon was also her downfall - the humans.  More so than anything else, the humans kept him the busiest of all.

He was intrigued by the inconsistencies in their behavior.  The love and hate, the kindness and savagery, and the unwillingness to submit.  They searched for time as fervently as he searched for her, and while they managed to live longer and longer they had eventually stopped fulfilling their purpose.  The humans served as a reminder that he was on the search for something greater.   They had to go; they were not what he wanted.  They were obstacles.

And with them gone, with everything gone, he could now see her clearly.  There she sat, her hands clasped tight, twiddling her thumbs whilst she waited.  It almost seemed a pity to break the silence; to end the game.

“I-“

“Yes, I know.”

She didn’t let him finish.  She knew; he knew.

“You don’t really have to go, you know – I mean, we can continue.  We can always continue.”

She looked at him, at the emptiness that he embodied, and then looked around – the same emptiness engulfed them.

“No, we cannot.”

No enthusiasm, no vibrancy, no chuckle or cry or even a hint of a smile – nothing.  She had nothing left.

And then there was nothing.
