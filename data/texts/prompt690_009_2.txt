Physics. The Art and Study of Motion and Physical Phenomena. My favorite one was when my opponents tried to figure out what phenomenon had just gotten their asses kicked. 

See, I wasn't your ordinary physics geek. I was an adrenaline junkie. At first I did sports. Football. Soccer. Baseball. Hell, I even did Motocross at a point. All of it was child's play when you could imagine and see the necessary vectors in your mind. 

But, it wasn't enough for me. By the time I had gotten to college I was already part of the underground street fighting crowd. Now, you might be asking how a kid from the Bronx ended up fighting for money under the streets of Maryland. Especially considering the fact that it was Maryland of all places. I had my ways but that's a story for another time. 

This fight was supposed to be my last. I had gotten bored. Undefeated. 100-0. I was the first. I was hoping the only. But then came along this guy. Blond hair, blue eyes, and a chiseled jawline. This kid couldn't have been more like a doctor if he tried. 

See, he was coming for my record. 99-0. That was what he had racked up in the time I was gone. He asked for me specifically for his 100th. He was a cocky son of a bitch. 

He shot out a jab with his left while stepping in. The force behind it wasn't strong enough for a direct shot. I pivoted with my left foot, my right foot dragging behind while my right arm came up to parry the blow. 

His arm relaxed into an open palm in an attempt to grab my hand while pulling me forward. He was bigger than me. He wanted to use that against me. Too bad for him that I was too planted. He couldn't pull me forward at that angle. There just wasn't enough torque. 

I smiled. His eyes widened. It had begun.
