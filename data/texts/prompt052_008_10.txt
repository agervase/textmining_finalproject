“Chicken Soup! Don’t tell me you’re making the chicken soup... I gave you the cookbook because you were the least likely to use it!”

  “Grandma, you died! what the f*@# are you doing here?!”

“I don’t know, you summoned me! Try making the gnocchi, that sends me back.”

  “But, what? but dad said the family business killed you.”

“That’s true”

 “He knew!?”

“He caught me on the job once, bit awkward, but that priest had it coming, couldn’t wait until the afterlife.”

  “So what were you doing here? A demon pretending to have a family.”

“Don’t get high and mighty with me, it’s called a fucking sabbatical.”

  “A sabbatical?!”

“You try torturing people for thousands of years, then the 20th century kicks off and everything changes, nothing works anymore, it’s all ‘saw that on game of thrones’ I needed a break, I needed to understand the way of things. Farmers, peasants, feudal lords, they’re easy. A modern teenager with FortniteBR? Different kettle of fish.”

  “How did you even have kids”

“Oh so f-ing god can screw the ‘virgin mary’ and start a while religion while on a weekend binge but I can’t have a family while on sabbatical?”

  “Well I suppose when you put it like that.”

“I was only meant to be away a few years, then one thing lead to another, I end up with ungrateful grandkids and a huge bill from finance.”

  “For being late for work?”

“No for returning a rental human body that had 94years on the clock! The dealership wasn’t happy. So where are we with that gnocchi?”

  “Oh yeah forgot about that... I’ll get started.”

“Don’t tell your folks, your dad always was overly sentimental.”

  “Ok, I won’t”

“And I’ll check in on you in 10yrs for your first day of work. Let you know who’s who”

  “Thanks, wait, in 10years, when I’m 32?”

“Yeah enjoy yourself! You get shafted real good”

  “What! Tell me what happens.”

“No deal, looks like I’m making gnocchi myself doesn’t it...”

End.
