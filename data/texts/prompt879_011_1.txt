Whoosh! I was back, like before. Fucking genies and their treacherous ways! But this time I'd get it right, I was sure!

'Genie, raise my most GCSE Science grade to an A!' I commanded. There was no way I could screw *this* up!

The air around me whipped around me in a vortex of winds, and I could see space warp itself into a tunnel. I was sucked through, and whipped out my phone, where I had taken a screenshot of my results. Perfect score! But... My answers hadn't changed! My face turned white as a sheet. I knew the call would come any minute now.

I flipped through my photo gallery, and looked around. In all my photos, I was dressed in a suit and a cardigan. And, glasses?  The genie had turned me into a limp wristed poncey nerd!

As if it had read my mind, my phone burst into song, the first couple of verses of Defying Gravity. What the fuck, me? I answered the call, and sure enough it was Mr Brown, head of IT.

"Maxwell, I've gone over your grades, and something's up. Your grade doesn't match your test, so I'm going to have to disqualify you for hacking the system."

Now my memories were getting all screwy. What had I been doing previously? My clothing began to morph into the  clothing I saw in the picture, and I started to develop a lisp as I talked.

"Uh, thaths thrange. I need to get back to you later."

I hung up immediately. I ran back to where I'd found the lamp, and tapped on it. The genie exited the lamp, and fortunately it seemed he didn't recognise me. What had I wished for before? And the time before that? I didn't know anymore. I just knew what I had to ask now...

"Uh, Genie, could you correct my biggest mistake?"
