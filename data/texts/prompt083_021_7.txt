The warming of cold steel in my hand makes me think of ice cream. I couldn't tell you why, I can only tell you that that's where my mind wanders to when a situation reaches this point. This exact point is me, Orin, standing here in the desert, pistol in hand and holding it to temple of Rize Righteous. 

Despite this immediate threat to his life, Mr Righteous' attention is actually fixated on the figure pacing somewhat triumphantly in front of him: the purple trenchcoat donned, curly-moustache'd and sinister figure of Bad Brinn the Bastard. Brinn briskly moves from right to left in front of our captive, arms waving in a mad fashion as he adds physical theatrics to the extremely long and not particularly clever monologue he's been performing for some time now. 

The reveal is probably one of the things he likes the most about his job as a villain which I think it fitting as his outfit makes him look like a cross between Captain Hook and a magician. By now, the gun in my palm is completely warm and I'm thinking of just how sticky my hand would be if I happened to be holding an ice cream in this desert instead. 

"You see, you _"heroes"_ seem to think you run this town but I.. I, Bad Brinn, am here to prove that the very opposite is true." I've tuned in again on what's happening immediately around me. It was an accident, yet now surprised to note that Brinn doesn't use "the Bastard" part of his evil moniker. I wonder why that is? Maybe I just made it up, I'm not sure. He and I have been together for nine months now and, before that, I knew of him as Bad Brinn the Bastard. It never really occurred to me that he never called himself that. 

"For far too long you and your band of do-gooders have been doing good wherever you see fit but the time has come for the real owners of the night to take the streets back." Bad Brinn was getting the climax of his speech, I could tell by the way he had slowed his pacing down to meet the beads of sweat gathering on his forehead. Fitness and stamina was not his strong point, though neither I nor Rize Righteous were likely to complain. 

"You'll never get away with this, Bastard!" cried Mr Righteous, chest puffed out and eyes ablaze with defiance. As he jerked forward to give Brinn a piece of his mind, the barrel of my gun never left his side. He wasn't likely to do much - his hands were bound tightly behind him and he was knelt upon his bright, yellow cape. Even if he tried to stand up, he'd fall down. I wasn't concerned. "The League of Light will catch wind of your devious scheme and put a stop to you and your henchmen!" 

"You mean these guys?" Brinn was positively beaming, like a game show host announcing a twist that was sure to defeat the show's contestants. From beneath his purple trench coat he pulled out four photographs. He tossed them in the dirt in front of Rize Righteous, cackling like a witch as the hero's face fell to despair. 

"No.. They can't.. This can't be!" I felt a pang of sympathy for Mr Righteous. He didn't see this coming at all. Before him lay four scenes that captured the deaths of his League of Light family; Lizzy Liberty, Captain Cooperation, Win-speration and The Truth. All images taken by Brinn at the exact time in which my gun went off. Rize's eyes rose from the photos to Brinn who had, like clockwork, produced a polaroid camera from his trench. Bad Brinn was grinning ear to ear and looking to me expectantly. I pulled the hammer back on my pistol as Rize closed his eyes. 

**BANG!**

A few wisps of smoke snake their way outwards and upwards from bullet sized hole in the camera Bad Brinn the Bastards held in front of his chest. His face is one of disbelief, he was on such a high. I feel sorry for him too but, really, he was a puppet. Brinn slumps to his knees, blood flowing from the gunshot wound, as I collect up the photos of dead League of Light heroes. I can hear him gasping a bit for words but I'm carefully placing a lighter to the photos and watching them catch fire. 

"You.. shot him." Now I can't tell who is more surprised; Brinn or Mr Righteous.

"Yes." I reply, letting the flaming photos fall to the dirt and tumble away in the slight breeze. 

"Are you helping me?" 

"No." 

**BANG!** 

Rize Righteous joins the fate of his friends and that of his foe, Bad Brinn, as I turn my back on the desert sunset and make for a getaway vehicle. Before I peel off down the road to find an ice cream store, I carefully pull a notebook and pen from my jacket pocket, opening it to the back page where a list of US cities and their heroes and villains are written. Some have been crossed off, like Denver and it's Defenders of the Devout or New York and the Night King. My pen runs a thick red line through the League of Light and Bad Brinn the Bastard. One less group of people thinking they're special. 

The engine roars into life as the last tendrils of light slink back across the desert horizon. The headlamps fix on the road ahead and I circle my next destination; Ike Iceman and the Indiana Invincibles.
