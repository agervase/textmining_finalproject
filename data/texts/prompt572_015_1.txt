"What is the defence system father?"

I jolt awake, violently.

When my eyes open and the darkness of the room swims into view, I sit up, barefeet on the wooden floor. I place my sweaty forehead in my hands and exhale.

Another dream. Why aren't they stopping? What do they mean?

The dreams are always filled with vibration and edgy, flickering scenes like they are either suppressed or embedded memories. Memories? How though? Are they really memories? How can they be memories if I have no memory of them?

The dreams though, or whatever they are, the dreams that occur night after night are becoming clearer and clearer as time goes on and the child, the child looks familiar too.

"I don't have a son," i say out loud, into the dark empty room.

My head hurts. The headache is a dull, throbbing, deep in the grey matter somewhere. Go away, just stop. Enough of the dreams, the fatigue, the niggling incomplete feelings with the headaches. Stop. Enough.

But I know they won't stop, I just know.

I stand up and open the curtains, staring out.

I see a torn sky, the ozone layer is gone, there is lightning and flickering radiation everywhere. The buildings are ruined, the roads, the street lights, everything is just ruined. And the black creatures that fell out of the sky are sleeping in the space above the earth.

I remember now. Just like I do every night. I remember the things I gave up, the things I said, the things that were taken from me, threatened. It's all my fault. It's all my fault and now I am suffering for it, night after night. Imprisoned in my own head, in my own memory loop.

I shut the curtains and turn away from the window, crawling back into bed. I bury myself in the covers and will myself to sleep, to sleep again, to be lost in it. Afterall, I know that I am only going to wake the next day with the same dreams, memories and reminders. Sleep is the only thing I have left now.
