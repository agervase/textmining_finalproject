Part I

I shuddered in a cold dark closet as my hands moved across the walls feeling every cut and groove in the surface.

*Where is that damn door?!*

I sigh heavily realizing this was the first time since this morning I had heard my own thought. Or had it been like this forever? I could not tell. From the moment my lips had touched that scalding coffee this morning everything seemed to have changed.

That barista never spelled my name right. On purpose, I reckon. And today he decided to burn my tongue too. Maybe that is what pushed me. Everything after that seems a blur. Some matrix looking agents approached me after my tantrum and hit me in the stomach with the butt of a shotgun. Next time I opened my eyes I was in a deserted ranch with a used shotgun and a note saying “Find me in the closet”

*Where is the shotgun?*

On that thought I felt my body panic as I threw myself to a side wall causing a door to bust open. I landed face front and looked up to find a full body mirror. A dishevelled reflection hosting a disgusted look stared back at me

*Yeah, yeah whatever.*

I took in my surroundings, which weren’t much. An old bed, a bathroom, mouldy walls and a window. What was I even doing here?

If this was a plot to a movie I’m certain I’d be playing a side character or the person who dies before the movie title is revealed.

I gulped as that thought consumed me. What if the movie title was yet to be revealed?

Looking back at my reflection I met the very plainness that was me. Slumped shoulders, non-existent muscles and scared posture. Yep. I could almost hear the narrator saying “Here we see the homo sapien that belongs to the bottom of most food chains. It cannot fight, nor think fast enough and it most certainly cannot run. One wonders what miracle or streak of luck could have allowed a specimen such as this to make it through the process of natural selection.”

A gagging sound coming from the bathroom breaks my train of thought. I whip my head so fast I nearly get a whiplash. Apprehension consumes me as I lean on my side to get a better look inside the bathroom, my hands in a karate posture, something I had never taken up in my life. When finally my eyes meet something fluffy. There was a Llama standing in front of a bathtub, looking as weak and pitiful as me with a panicked look on its face. I let out a sigh of relief which causes the poor thing to pee itself, followed by a retching sound after which it vomits in the bathtub

I run over and slam the bathroom door immediately, creating a barrier between myself and the animal. What the fuck is going on. My knees finally give in as I curl by the door. The vomiting sound continues for a bit as I lay there shaking.

*Why are you being so dramatic? Literally, nothing bad has happened to you except for the shotgun and the abduction.*

My inner voice was right. I was scaring myself just thinking of the possibility of something bad happening. This was ridiculous. I needed to grow a pair. So I got up, letting out a slow calming breath and opened the door.

The Llama was now sitting down on the other side of the bathtub looking sick and sad.

*Sad? Do I look sad to you, I’m fucking tired your nitwit.*

“What... Did… I just hear you in my head?” My voice came out weak and confused

*Who the fuck do you think you’ve been hearing all this while? It’s me! Can’t you tell the difference between my confident speaking pattern vs your pathetic thought process?*

The Llama rolled its eyes at me, or I thought it did.

*Where is the shotgun?* The voice added almost immediately

“Uh… I-I…” I began to stutter

*Oh god. Another idiot.*

A long silence followed as both of us stared into each other's eyes. This would have been romantic if the setting was a lot different and if I didn’t have an open-mouthed wide-eyed look.

*Now listen here. I have been in this exact scenario 50 times. And each shotgun owner has ended up dead. Sometimes before they got into the abandoned house, sometimes in the closet, and at other times they have died by misfiring the gun. This is the farthest anyone has ever made. And if I might add you are the weakest most pathetic thing out of the 50. So maybe your very useless existence is what is keeping you alive. Do you comprehend what you just heard?*

I nod slowly at the Llama as I try to feel for the doorknob behind me

*From here on, if you fail you will die. I will not die. I will just be forced to vomit 51 times. By that time another idiot will come through the door or die before, who knows. But I, as the only thinking talking Llama in this universe, do not wish to go through the process again. Comprende?*

“You speak Spanish?” I ask suddenly confused

*Did you just skim over everything I said?*

“Sorry I never expected Spanish. Wow. That confusion calmed me down” I look at the ground and notice the puddle of English & Spanish speaking Llama pee making its way over to my shoes. “Why did you pee yourself if you’ve been through this 50 times?”

*Because no one has ever made it to the bathroom! I peed myself because I was excited.*

“Huh… I used to pee myself when I was excited as a child” I mull this over “Wait is that the selection criteria here?”

*Oh god, would you just shut up? You lost the fucking gun. Who CARES what the selection criteria is! By sunset, you will be dead and I will be forced to go through this ALL over again!*

“By sunset?” I turn around and look through the window “The sun is starting to go down… What do I do Llama?!” I ask slightly worried.

*My name is Basil. And I would like to be called that.*

“What kind of a stupid talking Llama name is Basil?!”

*My parents were Catholics. And if you want my help you will have to be nicer.*

I feel my hands shaking with anger. This was a new feeling for me. I could just die and let this Llama vomit itself-

*It’s Basil. And I can hear your fucking thoughts.*

Taken aback with this new bit of information I bite my lower lip and sigh “OK. Basil. What. Do. I. Do?” I say each word out clearly, holding back the bubbling anger.

*Get the shotgun*

“Yes let’s move to AFTER the shotgun yeah? Let’s assume I have the shotgun, then what?”

*Find the seven of clubs. Obviously.*

“The seven of wha-? How is that obvious?”

*It was in the note.*

“The n-?” I pause and suddenly remembering the note I dig it out of my pocket. Lo and Behold. There it was written in clear black against yellow “Find the 7 of clubs”

“It’s at the back of the fucking note Basil! No one reads the back of a note if they wake up in the middle of nowhere with a shotgun!”

*Oh I know, in previous iterations of this scenario I had the note saying everything on one side and like no one ever came to see me. They just DIED. So I made some changes.*

“Ahuh. Ahuh. Yeah. So uh Basil where is this card?” I add sarcastically knowing well what his answer was going to be

*Welllll see. I don’t know. That is where you come in. BUT! I’m certain the shotgun is your best chance of survival here. So off you go!*

I clench my fists as I feel suddenly consumed by the urge to find the shotgun and kill Basil but upon seeing his worried expression at my thought process I box the urge away.
