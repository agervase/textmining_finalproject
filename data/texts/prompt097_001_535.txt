**The Year 3296**

**Intersolar Council on Luna**

Since the days of the moon being just a rock in orbit around Earth, silence had not reigned as supreme as it did now when thousands of representatives from all around the solar system watched their combined efforts bear fruit. Three hundred years of technological advancement, most of it born in bloodshed, now cruised towards the ultimate exploration.

It was a fleet of spaceships, built for the daunting task of traveling beyond the bounds of the solar system. Never had anyone but the most brave dared to leave the last haven of Pluto's orbit. But now, in between the Earth and the moon, mankind enslaved three of the four dimension it had to deal with for all its existence, warping space at their whim, to deliver their fleet into endless space.

"Starkey Orbiter active. Space distorition at one-hundred percent. All parameters stable." a hollow, robotic voice announced, breaking the silence in the council. "Waiting for further commands, Chairman."

The room was alight with hundreds of flashlights as journalists documented the historical moment. Chairman Alexis Markarov climbed on the dais, with his silouhette proudly in front of the screen. "Today, my friends, our species lets go of the last of our shackles. Today we finish what we have started over a thousand years ago. Humans! Today we conquer the universe!"

Thundering applause in the council, on Earth, on Mars, Venus, Titan, Enceladus and Callisto accompanied the imagery of two dozen ships engaging their engines to vanish, one after another, within the Starkey. Humanity stopped reaching for the stars, and finally grasped them.

**Brige of the flagship** ***Odysseus***

"All ships have sucessfully traversed through, Captain."

"Deploy the Starkey Lock."

"Affirmative,"

Captain Alfir Vidson felt a small bit of pressure lift from his chest at the thought that they would now always find their way home by following the beacon. He was the first to admit that he was no Magellan. He wasn't explorer material, and maybe that was why he was tasked with this expedition. There were too many explorers on board already. People from all branches of science, itching to get into the landing capsules and disect the planet they were on course to. Though, explorer or not, Vidson had to admit that the sight of Azurian Prime glistering in the sun of the Socrates system took his breath away.

"Sitrep," the Captain almost whispered.

"All systems nominal," came from his sailors. Short and precise answers, just as he liked it.

"Uhm... eh..." was instead the answer from his scientific officer. The young man flinched at the Captain's glare.

"Sorry, sir its just..."

"Out with it!"

"Its just... everything is fine." the officer said, but the confusion in the man's voice gave Vidson cause for pause. "Too fine, in fact" the officer added.

"Explain,"

The officer sighed, threw up his arms and said "I can't, really. This shouldn't be happening. There is close to no cosmic radiation. Three of the five planets in the system show habitable conditions in the first scans and the rest could be easily terraformed. Hell, there even is a gas cloud of dense oxygen - no - *air* in the middle of freaking space!" The man was close to shouting now. "You could breathe in space here!" he slammed one of his displays, pointing at a spot between the third and fourth planet.

Captain Vidson tried to digest what he was hearing with stoic calm. However, his musings about this apparent paradise system would have to wait as the bridge's systems lit up from a hundred displays.

"Captain!" His recon officer shouted. "We have contact at fourty-six, twenty down. Moving towards Azurian." The sailor turned around and stared at the captain with wide eyes, unbelieving of what he had seen himself. "Spacecraft." he chocked out.

One never ending moment long the bridge was stunned. Sailors remembered the obscure protocols concerning this situation, scientists tried to digest the immediate implications.

They were not alone.

"Captain. Orders?" came the small voice from his second in command.

"Make contact. Scan for what they are doing. Remain on course."

"Copy that. Sending Communication Data Package. I notify the linguistics and anthropologists. Recon, scan for all transmission and signals. Staying on course at thirty-two, fifty-seven by eleven."

Soldiers and sailors were an odd lot. They were part of the greatest discovery in human history, but once they had received their orders, they were focused on the task again. The extrasolar civilisation team was an entirely different case. Nobody in the military corps had believed the linguists and anthropologists would be needed on this trip at all. Yet when their feed opened on the main display, their startled and scared faces made apparent that they had shared that expectation.

"D-Do we h-have contact y-yet?" Dr. van Dera stuttered.

"Negative Doctor. We only sent the Data Packages, as is protocol." Vidson replied.

"Good, that is... good." van Dera said. He swiped a bit of cloth over his forehead, trying and failing to contain the cold sweat. He wasn't the only one. Many members of his team sat anxiously waiting for anything to work with. Soldiers needed orders, scientists needed data.

"Captain!" the recon offcier shouted out and dragged his own display onto the main one. "I'm scanning a lot of sudden heat signals as well as focused explosions on the ground of Azurian. I believe they are bombarding the planet."

The recon officer could barely finish his sentence before his communications officer dragged his own information onto the screen. "Captain. We have received a message. We decoded to text."

On the display, clear for all to see stood a small line. "Stand down. This does not concern you, sentients of Earth."

"What in the..." Vidson mumbled without anybody hearing. He couldn't even finish a thought before communications almost stumbled over themselves with data received.

"Captain, we get messages from all over Azurian. Most of it unusable, but we have received some data using our methods of image display." The officer dragged what he got onto the screen. It was a collage of horrible scenes. Colorful, bipedal and somewhat humanoid beings were torn apart by what looked like Napalm and undirected dumb bomb explosions. The recordings looked amateurish and shaky. Could simple people of any civilisation rummage through complex abstract data that quickly, Vidson wondered.

"Another message from Azurian. Strong signal. Its using waves. Its sound."

Suddenly the entire bridge was silent. The officer played the received message. From the speakers a voice rang out. It was frail, sounded scared and with an heavy, undefinable accent it said "Help us."

Any graveyard would have been louder than the bridge as all eyes were directed onto Captain Vidson. He stood with a rigid posture, seemingly calm, but in his mind his thoughts raced. "Doctor, what do you make of this?"

Van Dera sighed and his face took on an unreadable expression. "We are on a crossroads, Captain. I cannot give an answer, the question being if we are to apply human morality to this situation or not."

"I see," Vidson answered. His gaze went back to the scenes of the bipedal beings getting ripped apart. They had nothing remotely resembling weapons in hand. It was obvious that they were civilians and that the spacecraft in orbit did not care about that fact. His eyes went back to their message. "Stand down. This does not concern you". Aye, but Vidson was concerned. Because the Captain knew these images from their own history. Concern was mandatory.

"Then, Doctor, I think it is time to show the universe some human decency." Vidson said. "Send a message to the spacecraft telling them to cease fire immediately. Remain on course to Azurian. Send word to all Battalions to prepare for planetfall for humanitarian mission. Briefing pending."

"Captain. Heat signatures on collision course with the Odysseus. Its travelling fast."

"Engage active defensive systems. Return fire. Prepare a boarding party immediately."

Through the entire ship the moving of the railgun targeting motors could be heard. The active defense systems tried to hone in on the rockets, but it was too late. "BRACE FOR IMPACT!"

The bridge held onto their consoles with iron grips. The science officers trembled in fear, and even Vidson felt his hands shaking. The red dots on the radar collapsed onto the middle - onto their ship. Vidosn closed his eyes, prayed to all gods he knew that they would hold.

Then a little metalic "bonk" sound could be heard over and over again as the rockets hit their ship. Vidson knew the sound from small asteroids colliding with a hull. It was mostly harmless, due to their steel-ceramic plating.

"Well, that was impotent." his second in command said, followed by nervous laughter from around her.

Vidson didn't laugh. "Still, that wasn't just one warning shot. Those were dozens of warheads. Retaliate! Aim Railguns and fire when ready!"

It was like watching a grown man backhand a child for kicking him in the knee, Vidson thought. Their six warships fired from all barrels. It was a full barrage of the deadliest propjectiles they could muster. The sound of the railguns made him shiver by the thought of what these weapons could do with a ship.

Vidson still couldn't believe his eyes when the spacecraft practically disintegrated in a ball of fire.

"Captain. Another message from Azurian. Its... a feed."

"Send them one back. Camera on me."

What Vidson then saw took his breath away. It was a being of fluorescent skin, white as snow. It had colorful markings all over its body and large eyes of a deep blue. It was an otherworldly sight by its strange beauty alone. Its eyes locked onto him through the feed, it gazed upon him and then, startled. Its face distorted, its eyes grew large and with utter suprise it shouted "Terra!"
