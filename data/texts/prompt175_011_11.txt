The Gift of Names was as old as writing. All humans were born with the name of their soulmate on their chest over their heart, though only the person bearing the name could see it. For some there was a second name on the opposite side: the name of their eventually killer, should another human be destined to kill them. These days the majority of people had only a single name, but in the past having two was almost as common as one. Hannah had only one name, Christopher, and had been eager to meet him for as long as she could remember. She had met a few Christophers, but none which had her name on their chest, though one or two had lied in unsuccessful attempts to get her into bed with them. Hannah worked retail at a shoe store in the local mall, often lamenting about her situation with her coworker, Kit. He was about her age and they got along well enough, but he always seemed to keep his distance and was one of the most quiet people she'd ever met. She assumed it was shyness on his part: even though everybody knew the name of their eventual soulmate it didn't stop them from having some fun before they met them, and Hannah knew Kit, like many young men, found her quite attractive. Sometimes being attractive was to be intimidating.

Kit gave Hannah a poor excuse of a wave as she entered the store. She smiled and waved back, and made the usual small talk before starting her shift. Soon enough she excused herself to the back room to change into her uniform and clock in, and as he watched her walk away he gave a sad smile. He turned back towards the mirror across from the counter where customers could see how they looked in their shoes before buying them. Even through his shirt the names on his chest were visible to him, and they had haunted him ever since Hannah had begun to work there. On the left side of his chest was her name, and on the right was his own: Christopher.
