Ending the lives of people had always been a monotonous process to me. Yeah, I guess, at the start it was fun, but it gets boring after a while. People aren't always open to the thought of travelling across a new world, but I guess, it's inevitable isn't it? You had seen so much - the father who 'left his kid and a wife at home', the enthusiastic twenty year old entrepreneur who had 'so much left to live for'. They begged me for another chance - just another opportunity to live, but unfortunately, I'm not anyone's friend. I was just here to collect and move on.

So, as the people who crossed the door between life and death began to slowly decrease, I knew it would only be inevitable that my collection would soon be complete. Billions turning into millions, a million turning to a hundred thousand. Thousands into hundreds. And soon enough, hundreds into one. The final one. 

Life.

It was a pure white room we met in, like an enclosed box with the walls painted white, with a door where souls took their corporeal form to travel across to the realm of an impenetrable darkness - my realm. Life slowly paced into the room, slowly closing entrance door behind him. His own corporeal form was one that I had expected - he wore an old, frail look, dressed in a white robe, blending in perfectly with the pure white surroundings. It had seemed that my counterpart had aged well. 

"Have a seat", I told Life, pointing to the two chairs and the table I had set up for him. "We should talk".

We sat in silence for a few minutes. He had a look of deep thought, as if he was preparing to say something, reconsidering it, and thinking of something else. I didn't mind. I had waited countless years, and I can wait a few more minutes. He had no purpose himself anymore - the last human had passed many, many years ago. I couldn't call Life my enemy. I let him do what he needed to do - to let people live, for people to enjoy the charm that is called 'Life'. But the call of the realm on the other side was more enticing. 

"Death", he softly sighed, as he weakly leaned across the table. "You've won your game, my friend".

I smiled, only for a longer silence to follow. 

"Death. What makes you so enticing? Why do people not enjoy the call of life - to live, to feel, to breathe and to love?", Life questioned.

"With your gift, Life, you only bring people into trouble. Into a world with pressures, standards, unfulfilled dreams. Do you remember when we played cards for the life of that thirty-two year old father who died in a car crash?"

Life nodded.

"He was an accountant, highly successful one, as you may know. He had three lovely kids, John, Daniel and Melissa - I still remember their names so easily. He had a lovely wife who he loved dearly. You wanted him alive. I know you felt for him. But in reality, all those 'good things' were just stresses to him. If he had never lived, Life. He would have never had to worry".

"I understand, Death", he softly said while sighing, his forehead crinkling under the wears of age - possibly, the wears of his own existence. 

"It's best for you to get going now, Life. It's time for you to see the other end, and to follow the pathway everyone you have tried to save has crossed".

He stood up, slowly pacing towards the abyss on the other side. I opened the door for him. All he had to do was just step. And it would be the end, and I would have finished with my purpose.

He stood staring into the other side, then finally spoke, saying "Wait, Death. What could I have done better? To make people want me more than you. To make people want to live".

I sighed. "Life, you fool. You were always under my control. All your efforts were always fruitless. There was nothing you could have done. And you know why?".

"Death brings meaning to life". 

He nodded, as his body took the form of a soul, and finally entered the abyss.

Hopefully you guys managed to read whatever I could think of and write here! This is my first time writing for a writing prompt, and I don't usually write much other than what I am obligated for school, so I might have just not made any sense. If you guys can provide any feedback, it would be wonderful!
