Quiet down Martians, let me tell you a little tale,

About my home planet, here's the detail:

A big ball of molten rock like deep fried Metallica,

Got gassed up like it's high off indica,

But don't fear, that was just the atmosphere,

But let me steer, the story a few billion years,

Where shit started popping off,

like sperm cells from my gonads,

I'm talking monads,

Early ancestors of our early ancestor nomads,

They were quite dumb, I ain't got time for flattery,

They had one cell, so a bunch together were a battery,

But not literally, I'm talking phylogenetically,

If I went Back-teria and rapped in that era , I'd be a pro-karyote,

You know what I'm Saiyan? I'd be Kakarot,

As for Eu-karyote? You're al-gae like YMCA,

Then came the greens and leaves,

For our needs: to eat and smoke weed,

All this shit was going on at sea,

til one guy stood up like he was the real Me,

And walked on land,

that's when shit got out of hand,

Life became Complex like a god damn magazine,

Producing the biggest beings we've ever seen,

Some were fish, or lizards and one was my mum,

but some dyed out like the blonde hair on my bum,
 
Cause BAM! they were destroyed,

Big ass Asteroid,

I call it Nicki,

it smashed quickly

Left shit bloody like haemorrhoids,

The big guys, had no chance to survive,

So the small guys hid for their lives,

The smart animals,

Smaller birds and mammals,

Could now thrive,

Like Mike Tyson when he really trieth,

Then two steps later we got chimps fucking,

They made Man, who promptly started sucking,

each other off and called each other Homo,

erectus, so you expect us to not indulge in man-on-man porno?

For 200 000 years we perfected our species,

Then it all went to shit, like we traveled to Feces,

We outwitted lions and sharks and fucking elephants,

We were outfitted with the best defence that was evidenced,

Our big brains, 

But it's all the same,

We're dumb as fuck and it's evident,

BECAUSE YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS ELECTED DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT.
