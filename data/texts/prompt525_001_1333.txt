"Are these steaks precooked?" her father said, distaste darkening every furrow in his meaty face.

I nodded. I had spent the entire afternoon heating them up to perfection. "I went to your website and followed your instructions."

"That right?"

I nodded again and glanced at my girlfriend. She looked at her hands, clearly expecting her father to throw a fit any time now.

"The meat is just… dreadful. Truly dreadful. I’ve eaten rocks more tender."

"I’m sorry, Mr. Ramsay."

"Dad, I told you what happened to his shopping bags."

"Right, you did your best, and to be fair, the seasoning isn’t all that bad. I'd even admit that the potatoes and wine sauce are expertly done," Gordon said and wiped his mouth. "This is probably the best result you could’ve achieved given the horrendous meat – I mean, *awful* – next time you pick it out, pay attention to where it’s from. Pay attention while shopping, young man. I do *not* want you treating my little girl to this kind of quality – hell, she might need new teeth if you keep this up."

I nodded and apologized. "Let me take your plate, sir."

My girlfriend met me in the kitchen. "Should I tell him?" 

"I’m not sure that’s a good idea. Hopefully, he’ll let it slide – I don’t want to hurt his feelings."

She smiled and pecked my cheek, before returning to the table. I opened the freezer and dug out the rest of the meat. I had kept it all this time – it almost felt wrong cooking it, but what other choice did I have after my groceries got stolen.

I could still remember her smile when she handed me the wrapped meat that her father had cooked for us. We hadn’t been able to finish it then – the meat hadn’t been great, as he so eloquently had pointed out – and had put the leftovers in the freezer for sentimental reasons. Despite his rugged exterior and bad boy image, Mr. Ramsay was a kind man with a good heart. And sometimes even master chefs picked out the wrong meat.
