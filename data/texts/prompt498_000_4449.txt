I down the last glass of Absinthe. The sound of people cheering me on ringing in my head as I do. My opponent fell just half a glass short before his attempt was snuffed out by the roar of the remaining patrons at my achievement. I could see the pain in his glassy eyes as he glared at me. 

All the pain, with none of the glory.

Clearly, he was not one to accept his fate as evidenced by the last thing I saw before I completely blacked out, the glimmering of a standard kitchen knife.

"This is Poppy Harlow with the Channel 9 news. We have had reports of a bar fight going on at Joe's Tavern down at Southeast Avenue, resulting in one death. One of the fighters, allegedly "didn't even go for a single hit yet still won" as per the eyewitness testimonies of the patrons at the bar. We have one such witness here with us today by the name of Luis."

"Hello Luis, can you tell us what exactly happened in there?"

"Sure, man. I was just downing my sorrows when I heard people screaming man and I turned around to see this dude with a big-ass knife man and he was just swingin' ..... swingin' at this other dude who was pulling some major matrix shit man, the knife couldn't even touch the guy man he just kept moving left-right like he some ninja or somethin"

"What happened at the end?" 

"The knife guy managed to stab himself in the damn neck when the other guy slipped out of his choke hold. At that point, I just booked my ass outta the joint."

"Sounds like a trained martial artist. What seems to be so different with this incident that it has garnered such attention?"

"The thing is, he was unconscious the whole time."

EDIT:- I'm so glad people recognized the Rock Lee Drunken Fist reference, the Pewdiepie reference, the Ultra Instinct reference and the Ant-Man reference. Pretty easy to spot yeah, but still.
