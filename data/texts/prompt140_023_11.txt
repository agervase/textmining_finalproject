"*Wait, what?*" Said. "*This can't fucking be! THIRTY MINUTES!? JESUS INEXISTENT CHRIST!*"

"Maybe you should give him a day after fixing that thing and telling that poor..." -He looked at the label- "woman what happened."

"*A DAY!? SHE'S 284 YEARS OLD.*"

"Maybe she has a new life, a husband, children, grandchildren, grand-gran--"

"*Ok, I got it. I'm going to get more sand, give her a day, explain it and that's it.*"

"Anyway, we have a new record! 2191 years without screwing it up."

"*Leave me alone, Jesus was a mistake.*"

"You killed that man by breaking his clock and had to make a new one for him."

"*Yeah, and his time came a little later. I should have let him die the first time*"

"YOUR CREATED A RELIGION, COME ON, IT WAS FUN."

"*I'm leaving to the asile. See you later*"

The asile was in a very cold place, surrounded by trees, mountains and a little river on the side. A beautiful place to die alone.

"Nina? You have a visitor! She's coming right here. Do you need anything?"

The lady looked at the young nurse who was talking to her. She was so young. She remembered when she was this age, so full of dreams...

"*A painkiller.*"

"You had two today already."

"*Is not going to kill me, isn't it? Haha. Come on, bring me some.*"

"I wish I have that sense of humor when I reach your age! Be right back."

"*She won't need it, lady. Bring a blanket, a pillow and some tea please.*"

"Uhm, yes ma'am."

The girl left everything over the coffee table and closed the door.

"*Nina. 284 years old. Terminal colon cancer.*"

"**You piece of shit.**"

"*Pardon me?*"

"**OF COURSE I WILL NOT PARDON YOU.**"

"*Let me tell you what happened.*"

"**Are you going to kill me or not?**"

"*Let me explain.*"

"**ARE YOU!?**"

"*Yes. Shut up.*"

"**Fuck you.**"

"*Every human has an hourglass. When all the sand falls, you die. Yours... Fell of my desk. And all the sand was left simbolized 30 minutes.*"

"**YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PAIN I'VE BEEN IN THIS 214 YEARS. COLON CANCER IS THE WORST. I SHOULD BE DEAD, YOU'VE BEEN HERE 10 MINUTES, ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME IN 20 MINUTES!? KILL ME NOW, END THIS ALREADY IF YOU DARE YOU BASTARD.**"

"*How did you know it was me?*"

"**KILL ME AND LEAVE, NOW, IN THIS MOMENT. CUT MY THROAT, RIPP OFF MY EYES, EVERYTHING IS BETTER THAN BEING THIS WAY".**"

"Is everything ok?"

"*Oh. Yes Evelyn, she's just very tired and think I'm Death itself, can you believe? Haha. Bring me some medicine so I can talk to her a little better*."

"Of course."

The needle slide slowly but gently into Nina's skin. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes for a minute.

"Ok, what you want?"

"*To apologize. You've been like this for so long.*"

 "How many do I have left?"

"*23 hours, and 53 minutes*"

"You said I had 30 minutes of sand."

"*Just in case, we decided to give you time to say goodbye once you knew*"

"Can I disagree?"

"*With what?*"

"Take that sand, give it to Evelyn's hourglass. Kill me now. I have nothing left. My husband died, my childrend died, my grandchildren put me here years ago and never came back, that sand is all I have left."

"*I'm afraid it's against...*"

"You owe me."

"*Yes.*"

"Hug me."

"*Good bye Nina.*"

"**Help mother too.**"

Nina exhaled her last time and slowly all her body warmth fade away.

"*Evelyn?*"

"Ye-- OH MY GOD SHE'S DEAD."

"*Yes.*"

"Oh my god I killed her."

"*Evelyn. Don't.*"

"Why?"

"*You've been gifted. Use it wisely.*"

Evelyn suddenly calmed down.

"My mom used to work here, she introduced me to Nina when I was little. I have to tell her mother."

"*Her mother?*"

"We thought it was some genetical thing, since her mother is almost in the same condition as she was. But she's in another asile, I have to make the call."

"*Wait a second. Same condition?*"

"Her mother, Susan, recently reached 301 years old (that's what she told us)."

"*Well. Fuck.*"
