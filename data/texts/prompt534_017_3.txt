*"Scythe"*

&#x200B;

\------

Death had come for Tom, but the bony hands reaching out toward him were palms-up, holding his scythe. Offering it.

Tom's fists were clenched at his sides. "Who decided this? Is it because of my uncle, my sister, my best friend? You took them, you bastard! And you think that makes me qualified to use this on others!"

Death only spoke in hints: in this case by causing an hourglass to appear beside him along with a tombstone with the word "EVERYONE".

Tom said, "I want to trade. Give me the God of Magic's staff or the Healer's crossbow instead."

Death's props vanished and a dead tree with only a single limb appeared. No branching paths.

Snarling, Tom snatched the scythe and tried to swing it overhand at its owner. The weapon was heavy, far too much for a mortal to bear. Death dodged easily, then vanished in a puff of grave-dust before Tom could pick it back up off the ground.

Tom kicked the scythe, and it moved a little despite its mass. He reached for it and found that though he could sense how burdensome it was, he could also lift it as though it were attuned and obedient to him now. The wooden handle was worn completely smooth with age. The long, awkwardly angled blade had such a sharp edge that it gave off mist as it trembled in his grip, cutting the air itself.

Death was gone and Tom had been pushed into accepting the gift. Well, then. Surely Tom couldn't be expected to bear responsibility for murdering literally everyone whose time had come; this was a mythic item. Something that responded to symbolic deeds.

Tom walked back to his home village and drew stares and horrified shouts. Understandably. He said, "Everyone, listen. We're going to build the thickest, deepest crypt we can, and lock and bury this thing as thoroughly as possible!"
