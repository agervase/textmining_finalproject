Halloween. What a magical time of year. When it's normal to wear costumes and dye your hair bizarre colors even though you're not going to an anime or gaming convention. Every year, it was my favorite time of year, except this year.

Early in October, the 4th or 5th I think, I dyed my hair bright pink. I mean the color you get when you launch Oblivion and play with the sliders until it looks like your hair literally glows. That kind of bright pink. My best friend dyed his hair green. His hair didn't glow. Perfectly fine with us since we, and a few other friends, rented a house together. Do you know how hard it is to sleep when your hair glows? Especially since I require absolute darkness when I sleep.

Things started getting weird a few days later. Well, weirder than glowing pink hair.

Chaz and I went to a bar. I had just read the hair color bottle and realized just what the hell I've gotten into. He figured things wouldn't look so bad in the morning, and to help me get there, we were going to forget the night.

It's a good thing I didn't forget. I learned a lot about myself and Main Character Syndrome that night. See, I have this ability not many people have, not caused by MCS. I can wiggle my ears. Big deal, I know. But it's a hell of a lot of fun to see a bunch of drunk guys try it. While running through my bit of party tricks, -joints that bend in ways they really shouldn't, drinking games (turns out MCS allows you to drink **a lot** more than normal), and the like- I did my ear wiggle thing. For once, it didn't cause a bunch of guys to try the same. This time, they all stopped and stared. What could possibly have caused them to do that, other than my glowing hair? Looking around, all eyes were on me, lots of jaws on the floor. Something on my face? I looked in the mirror and my jaw joined the rest. My hair wasn't glowing.

"Fucking hell! There goes $500!" Chaz shouted.

This shocked me back to reality. "Hmmm? What was that?" I asked.

Chaz got nervous. "Uh, funny story. Jake, Steve, and I made a bet. Uh, I think it was the day after you dyed your hair and were hiding in your room. We were out in the living room, Kaji was at work I think. Jake said the glow wouldn't last long, Steve said you'd find a way to turn it off and on, I said the glow was permanent, until the color came out. Kaji told us all we were idiots when he came home. Probably should have listened to him."

Now, bets like this are normal in our friend group. 99% of the time, they don't cross any lines because we're all familiar enough with each other to know where the line is. A shame no one had glowing hair before me, cause then we'd know where the line is for that. Turns out, this was that 1% of the time. And for me, the line was miles back. Or in this case days, since the bar is only a few blocks from our house.

I took a step forward. "Oh? Yeah, you *really* should have listened to Kaji."

Chaz stepped back. "Uh, maybe I shouldn't have told you." 

The rest of the crowd decided now was to great time to not be near Chaz. Funny thing about bars, as long as someone isn't picking a fight, they know exactly when one is brewing. Even the most thick headed or socially oblivious of them. A shame many of the thick headed ones can't figure out when they're about to start a fight.

"Oh, you really should have, just not tonight, or any time in the future. But maybe when you made the bet we could have laughed about it." An evil grin crossed my face. "Heh, I'm already laughing." I felt sober near instantly. Mentally shrugging, I blamed that on MCS. To be fair, it's not the weirdest thing the past few days I had gone through.

With a clear path to Chaz, I took a step forward. He stepped back. This is pretty funny by itself. Here I am, 5 foot 10 and pretty light at 135 pounds. Chaz is just over 6 foot and weighs almost twice as much as I do. I know for a fact, or knew I guess, that if he wanted to, he could drop me to the ground, and he was scared of me. I am pretty sure if Kaji were there, he'd get popcorn out. Of course, if Kaji were there, I would probably also have a couple more targets named Steve and Jake. So maybe it's a good thing Kaji wasn't there.

MCS is a funny thing. You know how anime characters have superhuman strength, speed, and agility seemingly on demand, and seem to ignore a large amount of gravity's pull? That's what happened to me. Feeling lighter than air, I stepped forward and began to turn to the side. Knowing my upper body strength was pretty low, or at least used to be before MCS, I brought my leg up for a kick, Chun Li style. Chaz brought his arms up to try to block or deflect. I'm not really sure what happened, with the amount of force behind my kick, his arms should have shattered. Not my intention but I had no idea that's how hard I could hit. Maybe part of my MCS transferred to him, maybe it was because his hair was green, maybe the universe decided he was my sidekick. I'm still in the dark about this, but instead of what should have happened, he flew backwards, knocking tables, drinks, and chairs everywhere, and crashing into the wall, settling into a pile of everything he crashed through, which got dragged with him. Somehow, the wall was just as unscathed as Chaz. The whole thing almost felt like a dream.

I would have immediately rushed over, realizing I just tried to kick my friend through a wall, but something strange happened. Big whoop, the whole night's been strange so far, why would this be different, right? When I'm stressed, my muscles like to tense up a lot, this causes my ears to move back (half of the ear wiggle) and **that** caused my hair to glow again. So of course everyone (formerly in shock from everything that's happened thus far) rushes up to me and is clamoring for me to turn my hair glow on and off. I'm still freaking out because I have no idea my best friend is still alive and miraculously unscathed, despite being in a pile of tables and chairs, so of course I can't indulge a crowd. Normally, I would have done my best to weave through them, but I really didn't want to hurt anyone. I didn't know that, like my hair, I could "turn on and off" my main character abilities, though that happened subconsciously.

Chaz managed to dig himself out of his mess and had no qualms about moving people out of his way. Seeing the state I was in, he does the one thing appropriate for a victor in a friendly bar fight.

Grabbing my wrist and raising my hand in the air, he announced, "And the winner of this match is Pinkie! Someone get this man a drink!"

So there I was with about 15 different drinks being thrust at me and the party gets crashed by cops. Some idiot decided to call them as soon as it was apparent a fight was going to break out. I mean, really, bar fights happen all the time, and as far as they go, the fight between Chaz and I was pretty tame. So the cops come in, break up the crowd, and sit Chaz and I down on the curb outside to figure out what the hell happened. Maybe they could tell me, because I sure as hell had no idea what went on. Surprisingly, everything went well. Mine isn't the first case of MCS the police department has seen. They let us go with a slap on the wrist for the disturbance and a warning of, "You pull any vigilante shit, you'll be spending time in a jail cell. You want to fight crime, you talk to us first. We don't mind you putting a stop to what you see like any other citizen who's not willing to be a bystander, just don't go looking for it."

I had every intention of doing as the officer said. I still do and have followed his instructions to the letter. But after a week and a half, I've spent so much time at the police station, they basically have a desk reserved for questioning me. Often, I'm there two or three times a day. I go to the bank, there's a robbery in progress. I go to the supermarket, there's an idiot stuffing his pockets with merchandise. I go try to buy a car, and some dumbass is about to drive away in a sports car. It just doesn't fucking end.

So here I am hiding in my room. After all the crime fighting, declarations of love from childhood friends, and anything else you'd expect to happen to a protagonist, can you really blame me? On the bright side, Chaz, Steve, and Jake felt bad about the bet and bought me a few really nice upgrades for my PC with the bet money. I really wish I could do something nice for them, but for now, leaving my house is just too damn dangerous. On the other bright side, between me not leaving my house and news that there was a hero with glowing pink hair in my city, crime is at an all time low.

Holy shit, it's been a while since I've written anything like that. I have trouble with paragraph breaks so any suggestions on where I need them and where I don't would be appreciated. Of course, any other suggestions would be welcome too.
