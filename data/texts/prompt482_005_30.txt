The department of power management was established after an incident where a young man's powers went out of control resulting in a massive release of energy. Prior to that everyone had believed that powers were rare. But in the aftermath, it emerged that someone had a set of powers that could have solved the issue easily and neatly that lived only a short distance away. They were unknown and had been living like a normal person. It turned out that the majority of power holders choose to live normal lives. After the incident, new laws were passed requiring the registration of one's powers. These laws also required people to assist if their powers were capable of stopping a crisis. Some embraced this fully becoming full-time heroes working for the DPM others refused to register becoming villains.

While powers were more common than previously thought that still didn't make them an everyday occurrence. Claire sat in her office looking through her files on the sixty or so power holders in the city.  Sitting across from her was a pair of heroes, two of the cities power holders. No, she corrected herself, one of the cities power holders and Captain Paragon. She brought up Captain Paragon's file. He patiently sat there, a friendly smile on his face wearing a white bedsheet as a cape, yellow rubber boots and with a store bought stun gun at his waist, as she looked through his file for the thousandth time. He had come up zero on every power detection test ever devised, he had failed the DPM's fitness tests and failed them miserably and his list of self-reported powers was long and read like a teenager's superpower wishlist. "Heat beams like Brightstar has" and "wall rebuilding vision" were two standouts. Captain Paragon had failed to demonstrate a single one of these powers on any occasion and thus each power was marked as "unconfirmed". It was clear that his reported powers were completely fictitious which would normally be enough for some nasty fines as failing to report powers or reporting powers falsely was a crime, yet whenever the subject was brought to the attention of the relevant people the issue was dismissed. But by far the most frustrating aspect of the Captain's file was the achievements and exploits section. It was massive and contained name after name of captured villains but unlike the powers section each entry was marked "confirmed". These achievements were no fictitious lies, filled jail cells stood as a testament to that. Somehow this bumbling powerless man was by far the most prolific hero and effective hero in the city.

His partner which now sat beside him was a former villain that the Captain had managed to coax into giving up his villainous ways, signing up with the DPM and becoming his partner. He'd been a dangerous one, his power was the ability to teleport any apple that he was holding to any point within two hundred meters. The man's morals had kept him from using this power to teleport apples inside living things but he had used it to great effect in disabling police and security equipment. How the Captain had managed to convince such a man was a mystery.

Claire looked over both of them. "So you're going to tell me how you guys were able to drag back a villain that was able to beat Brightstar of all people and without a scratch on either of you," The two men exchanged a quick glance before the former villain replied "The captain spoke to him and that's all that happened"

Much later in the evening after dealing with DPM debriefs, hordes of reporters and fans requesting his autograph Captain Paragon slipped into his small, cramped apartment and divested himself of his bedsheet cape and rubber boots. There had been many offers by people to upgrade his gear to something less 'thrown together by an amateur in twenty minutes' and more 'professional hero serving the city'  but he felt they rather missed the point. He wasn't anything like the other heroes and he wanted this to be apparent. He wasn't a glorious demigod descended to save the day he was a dumb idiot wading into matters he couldn't possibly contend with.

He flicked the television on and dropped onto his couch. The news was on and they were talking about him. He'd made on to national news it seemed, every news channel was talking about the weird local hero who took down one of Brightstar's nemesis. This was a level of fame he was a little uncomfortable with. With a sigh, he looked at the certificate that hung on the wall above the television, a reminder of a past life. "Donovan Donogal licenced therapist" it read. It had been a while since it was relevant, it had been a while since that hostage situation were he had been taken prisoner. Where he had talked the scared and panicking hostage takers down. He ended up caught up in another incident not long later where he again talked down the culprit. This became a running thing. People would even recognize him from his earlier exploits, they'd call him a hero and they'd seek him out if something similar was happening. He couldn't remember when he started wearing the bedsheet, but it had been a joke at the time. He remembered signing up for the DPM's vigilante program and how the space on the forms for powers was marked mandatory so he filled it with everything and anything he could think off.

&#x200B;

Now he was famous. Famous for catching criminals. The news spoke about the criminals he had caught but where they talked of in terms of evil people undeserving of mercy he remember each of their faces and each emotional problem that had bested them. He remembered seeing their pain and suffering in their eyes. His time in a cape had taught him two things; happy people rarely commit cruel acts and true psychopaths were rare. He had found the majority of criminals and villains were not evil monsters just people who needed help.

The news program cut its discussion Captain Paragon to announce breaking news of a bank robbery in progress. Shots had been fired and hostages had been taken. The middle-aged Donovan pulled his tired frame from his comfortable couch. He donned his vestments of bedsheets and rubber boots. He strode out into the night following the sounds of sirens.
