I cruised through the dark waters, endlessly murky.

I had some ample time to reflect on my condition while I cruised. After all, moving was pretty simple. I only had to point my body in the right direction.

My engines are still operating. I know that much. I wouldn't be here if my engines weren't working. I'm rusting, though. My skin, once painted a dark steel blue to blend in with the sea, is slowly turning reddish-brown as patches of rust spread across my exterior. Thank the maker it hadn't spread to my rudder yet. I wouldn't be able to steer myself if my rudder had rusted over.

I never really knew where I came from. I just remember... coming to life one day, on a day like this. I was lowered into the water to begin my mission.

I performed admirably. I cruised through the dark sea, searching for prey. Those steel bottoms that disappeared into the surface. I never really knew why I was killing them, just that those soft creatures in my body told me to do it. In fact, I don't even remember killing. All I remember is sneezing. Something would come out of my nose, and then an explosion.

I don't know my purpose anymore. Now I just... exist. I just go on my patrol, cruising through the sea. I remember the sky, though. The world above the surface. I remember it was beautiful.

The creatures in my body don't tell me anything anymore. I remembered that they used to, scurrying through my body, maintaining my engines and telling me where to steer. Now they sort of lie there. They don't even inflate their chests anymore. I never knew why they did that. I never had to. Perhaps it was something they had to do.

And since the creatures don't tell me what to do now, I don't know what to do. So for now I just swim. I just churn my propeller, taking me wherever the sea takes me.

Am I the last?
