\[11:43AM\] You: *Hey*

***11-24-18***

\[2:09PM\] You: *Emily, can we talk?*

***11-26-18***

\[1:52AM\] You: *I want to apologize to you for our last date. I’ve been picking up a few extra shifts recently and it’s not really not a good mix with school. I was super drained and I wasn’t paying attention to what I was saying. It was a disaster and I’ll make it up to you. Can you at least say something? I know you’re reading these.*

Daniel’s phone vibrated underneath his pillow, jolting him awake. A surge of dread ripped across his gut. It had to be Emily. He hadn’t been texting anyone else. He dug under his pillow until he could manage something of a grip on his phone. He assaulted the home button with his thumb until the screen lit up. *One new notification: Em*, the screen said. Before he could interpret the message from the preview, he quickly unlocked his screen and opened the message fully—he felt her response was too important to read from the preview first.

***11-27-18***

\[9:02AM\] Em: *Ok. I really thought you’d take a hint by now.*

Daniel’s head spun. His heart broke into a violent throb.

\[9:04AM\] You: *Seriously? I’m calling you.*

He dialed Emily’s number as fast as he could. His hands jittered to the point where he could barely land his finger on the right digit. After a ring or two, it went to voicemail. He tried again. Voicemail. Another time. Voicemail.

\[9:07AM\] You: *Pick up. We need to talk about this.*

He instinctively grabbed his old teddy bear from the crack between his bed and the wall and pressed it against his chest as he paced the room. The phone vibrated in his other hand. Another surge of dread.

\[9:08AM\] Em: *Lol we really don’t though. Since you won’t take a hint I’ll spell it out. You aren’t funny and you’re probably the clingiest person I ever met. Don’t want to waste anymore of my time. Bye!*

“Are you fucking serious?” Daniel barked at his phone. He felt his skin pinching out droplets of sweat all across his body. His hands lasered across the keyboard.

\[9:08AM\] You: *Are you fucking serious?*

\[9:09AM\] SMS Delivery Status Notification: *(FAILURE) Message not sent. This person is not receiving messages at this time. See technical details for more information.*

Daniel twitched. “Oh, okay.” He scoffed. There was silence. Standing still, Daniel reread the final message at least a dozen times. “Okay, cool. Cool. Cool,” A wave of heat burst from the bottom of his gut, “FUCK YOU!” Daniel blinked, and in the next moment, a phone-shape dent seemed to have appear on the wall across from him, along with a vaguely phone-shaped pile of rubble scattered across the floor. A medley of strange and conflicting emotions cycled through Daniel as he stomped through his room. He sighed, he laughed abruptly, he cursed, he tossed and turned; that hurt him. And it hurt him badly. “She’s *awful*. She is *aw-ful.*” Daniel whispered to himself, “The fucking Devil!” He barked as he flung his teddy bear to the wall. Before Daniel could continue in his fit, he noticed the teddy bear squirm in the corner of his eye. He whipped his head in its direction and froze. It was standing upright.

“Alright, you got me, you got me.” A deep and raspy voice exhaled relentingly. Daniel only stared. The teddy bear opened its mouth again, “How’d you finally figure it out?”

Daniel began to giggle erratically. “I really thought it take more than that. To make me lose my mind. A girl? Seriously?” He grumbled to himself. He turned away from the teddy bear and looked at the clock. He had another shift in a few hours. He careful unwrapped his blanket and draped it over his head before plopping squarely back into bed.

“You’re gonna ignore me? Ouch, Danny. I see you’re taking a page out of Emily’s book on this one.” The voice mocked. Daniel did not respond. As the teddy bear was about to take another stab at Daniel, he heard him sniffling. The teddy bear stared, “Uh… Dude, are you crying?”

Daniel mumbled something inaudible to the teddy bear.

“What?”

“Fuck. You.” Daniel whined.

“Uh…” The teddy bear felt guilty. It sighed and sat against the wall. A few measures of silences passed. “Sorry, man. I’m in the habit of tormenting people. Like you said, I’m the Devil, so… Yeah. Sorry.”

Daniel shifted beneath his covers and peaked at the teddy bear, “You’re the Devil?” He eyeballed it from head to toe, “Why do you look so stupid?”

The teddy bear laughed, “Humans, I feel like you guys can’t help asking pointless questions. I can take whichever form I please-”

“You’re not the Devil.” Daniel sniffled, “If you’re anything, you’re an asshole. An asshole spirit, maybe.”

“I’m gonna let that slide this once, but I’m telling you-”

“Look, man. I’m going through a lot right now and I have work in a few hours. At least let me take a goddamn nap. Just go away.” Daniel covered his head and turned away.

“You’re the one that called upon me! I thought you were going to ask me to curse your girlfriend or something.” The teddy bear said.

“Well, looks like we’re both out of luck because I don’t have a girlfriend anymore.” Daniel whimpered.

The teddy bear sighed once again, “Girls… Danny, my man, I haven’t done this in fourteen thousand years, but I’m gonna give you some unsolicited advice. Let it go. Focus on yourself for a while. Be the best man you can be. Do things that make you happy, don’t just waste your life at work doing things you hate. You only have sixty three years left anyway, you gotta make them count, man. Trust me, if you become the best man you can be, a better girl will come to you.”

Daniel’s head popped up from his covers. His eyes watering, he exchanged a heart-rending glance with the teddy bear. “You really think I can do that?”

“You know it.” The teddy bear reassured.

Daniel wiped his tears away, “I needed to hear that. Thanks, man.”

“Sure thing, Danny.” The teddy bear paused, “Uh, anyway, while I’m here, do you want to trade your eternal soul for mastery of the dark arts? Riches? Fame?”

“Nah.”

“You know, I did give you some of the best advice possible. I could take your soul in exchange for that.” The teddy bear smirked.

“You said it was unsolicited.” Daniel covered his head once again, “Asshole.”

“…” The teddy bear didn’t really know what to say. “You got me there.” The teddy bear threw an incantation in an ancient tongue, and in a flash of heat and demonic energy, vanished. He only left behind note for Daniel, written in runes and glyphs that appeared unreadable. Somehow, however, it left the impression of words in the reader’s mind. When Daniel would eventually read it, he would find it said: *I believe in you.*
