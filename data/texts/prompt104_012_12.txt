*It was difficult to remember, but even harder to forget.* 

I ventured, as I did every Saturday morning, to Tony's Gelato shop. The summer air was warm, but a cool breeze made sure it wasn't unbearably hot. A perfect day for gelato, especially Tony's. 

As I crossed the park gates and turned a corner to where the shop was, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. A bright sheen on the ground. Curiosity getting the better of me, I slowed my stride and bent to pick it up. 

At first, I mistook it for a normal 50p piece. As I brought it closer towards me to inspect it, however, I began to notice the irregularities. For starters, it wasn't a Heptagon but rather an Octagon. Secondly, it appeared to be a Â£2 piece instead of 50p. But most startlingly, the face on the coin was not Her Majesty's. It was mine. 

*I tried to forget, now I try* ***not*** *to remember.* 

When did I start smelling smoke and sulphur? Was there a fire nearby? I looked to find the park no longer green and full of life, but burned to a crisp and dead. The row of houses around it were in ruins, smoke rising from their ashes. 

I looked at the coin again, starting to remember. 

*You did this. And you ran from the truth.*

I looked around at the wasteland that I had created. My eyes seemed to play tricks on me. One minute, I was looking at the park as it was; verdant and hopeful. Or was that how it is now? The next, I was looking at an image of desolation and inferno. Or was that in the past?

I had done this. And in my inability to face reality, I had created my own.  

*Behold, the works of your hand.*

Holding the coin tightly in my hand, I picked up the pace. After all, I didn't want my favourite flavour of gelato to be sold out. Tony would never forgive me if I was late! 

Was there something else Tony would never forgive me for? Pushing the thought from my head, I strolled towards the edge of the park, leaving behind the green, lush world.
