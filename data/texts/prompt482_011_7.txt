"Gas man is robbing a bank! Please help! **cough cough**" said the policeman over the radio.

"*What even is my power? Whats my real name?"* I thought to myself.

Before long I was there, stood outside the bank, I looked inside the bank, everyone coughing and struggling. I lock eyes with the villain and begin to motion my hand.

"no, please, I surrender!" he shouts and suddenly the gas dissipated.

"*Always too easy, always so boring. Why do they surrender?"* I think to myself.

Several days later, I found myself before the council of nations.

"The inventor has built a machine to absorb powers. He's bullet proof, he can fly, he can control lightning, I could go on..., but he's announced he'll enslave the human race, unless... I'm so sorry to have to ask you this. Your are only hope. I don't think he'll surrender. You might have to actually... use your power." a councilman says.

"So be it" I said with slight fear.

"*What am I capable of?"*

It's only a matter of time I found myself stood in front of a black haired scientist stood proudly in front of his invention, whirring away. I could hear the electricity humming.

"there's a gun on that desk, shoot me" he beckons.

I pick up the gun and shoot. **Ping**. It ricochets off his steel body.

"The only way you can stop me is by using your power!" he taunts.

"So be it!" I shout, raising my hand. And for once I complete the gesture.

"Hah! Your power did nothing, and now I've absorbed it! Let's see what you can do!" he laughs and makes the same gesture.

I fall to my knees "I surrender!" I shout.

"That's it isn't it? That's your power. I knew. What shall we call you? Surrender man? Anyway, no need for this anymore" he says, flicking a switch. Suddenly the humming stops and the machine stops spinning.

"Come, see me announce myself as the Earth's first supreme overlord" he says, offering me his hand.

I take his hand.

*"Go power, whatever it you are, just do it, now"* I willed myself.

"What? Where am I? Who am I" says the former villain.
