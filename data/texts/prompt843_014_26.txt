Most folks are happy to leave their life to fate.

The mystical re-living of the day is used by them in a happy-go lucky way, and they argue that the tenets of our spiritual beliefs imply that it is meant to be used like that. A gift to relive the happy days.

I say fuck that.

I devised the system when I was still a girl, merely eight years old.

**0** meant the day should be lived normally. **0** meant being relaxed and like others.

**1** meant that something had gone wrong. It meant being alert.

**2** meant that I should avoid risks.

**3** meant that I should take risks. And if that didn't give a good result, on to the next repeat. And so on.

See, the crux of the problem with re-living the day without memory is that you'll just end up making the same mistake. The only form of communication, of *control* we have, is that number, burned somewhere faraway into our mental eye.

Most people don't use that control. Most people are fools.

"Shall I ready the steam-jet, miss?"

I deigned my servant a nod. I had devised a system where I kept repeating every day at the end, until I reached the number associated with the proper attitude for that day. It had left me vastly wealthy, and vastly powerful.

Today, however, was a conundrum.

The system only went up to **564** different attitudes. The number today was **7212**, and something was horribly wrong.

"Miss? Is something the matter?"

What should I do? Smile affably? No, if an attitude of reservedness was apt, the number would be **155**. This, this called for an attitude outside the system. Completely unexpected behaviour.

"No, I'm fine."

But then, I had probably acted as unexpected as possible the previous 6800 times I did this. Then what? 

"On second thought, I think I'll stay at home today."

"Miss...? Are you sure? Today is-"

"I know what day it is!" I snapped.

Try to be as careful as possible. Yes, that seemed the best solution. I took to my lounge and turned on the huge crystal-screen on the wall. Nothing yet on the news, either. A fairly high average of reported repeats, but that could mean anything. 

The sages argued that every repeat was different for every person, infinite branches of combinations, and you only experienced a world where others had already cast their final choice. But a high number could mean happiness or grief. Anything.

I sighed. I had bought myself the best tech, the best security. I had chosen the best country, found the perfect love, two children that were ideally educated. What, then, could go wrong today? Some missed chance? Some inevitable disaster?

I sat on my couch, and waited, then froze. What if I had been inactive like this, **6800** times over? No, I needed to get out, try unexpected things...but maybe I had done that **6800** times as well. After all, would I react different to **7212** than to **7211**? No, best to just wait and see...at least I would be safe. What was the worst that could happen, then?

It was only near the end of the day, that the news finally came in.

"...speculate that because the Empress has not shown up at the table of negotiations, tensions have risen dramatically. Normally, Ustria was supposed to report on their disarmament schedule today, and all experts seemed to agree they were doing well. However, the absence of Empress Alayna and the unnaturally high average repeat numbers have sown suspicion over the meeting. Tomorrow, a more thorough investigation into Ustria's steam-bombs might be-"

I felt the blood drain from my face. Already, possibilities were falling into place. I had made the wrong choice. *How many times?*

Maybe it was not too late yet. I got up, but froze when the news reporter was interrupted, as a new report was placed before him. He paled as well now.

"Reports are coming in that the southern regions have lost all radio transmission with the mainland. Reported sightings of steam-bomb clouds-"

Suddenly the signal cut off, and I stared out the window, at the setting sun. 

And I realised, it was my very nature that had cost me the country. The system was focused on my happiness, only me, and that egotistical nature had compelled me to stay at home for my own safety. **6800** times over.

From where the sun touched the horizon, crimson as blood, a cloud rose up, mushrooming to the sky.

It was not too late, I though, as the deafening soundblast shattered windows around me. The destructive wave would come soon, but I already knew: the sun would disappear first.

Maybe the next time, I would put the country first.

I closed my eyes, and chose reset.

*Yes.* A tear slid down my trembling cheeks. *Maybe next time.*
