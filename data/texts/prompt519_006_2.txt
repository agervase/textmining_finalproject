It's was week before I started to get worried. A month before I had to do something.

"The Nineties Kids" were one of the most famous non-professional YouTuber around. Of course that was because the records for being one the longest running channels with a 100 million subscriber. They started the channel all the way back in 2040. 10 years before my own birth. At first there were 16 of them. Friends of here and there, and all had capture equipment. They would play any game asked of them and between the 16 of them almost every game, but their most popular series was their playings Minecraft 3. The third "official set" of Minecraft. Where updates were almost never occurring. Of course by the time the official set starting coming there were so many things in Minecraft it was impossible to keep up. The last Minecraft ever was Minecraft 7, but The Nineties Kids changed off 3.

Each of them had their own house and land, except Mr and Ms Whitewood, who were married irl and shared a house on their server of "Cool Kids Table". Paul Leave and John Bark were the main builders. Between the two of them almost everything in Cool Kids Table was made. From art, to games, to multi-layer dungeons. They upload video month, then daily when they started retiring. Then 2065 happened.

I was 15 when it happened, the very first of summer break, a video of posted that one of The Nineties Kids was dead. It wasn't from The Nineties Kids channel. It was CNN, because Robert Parks had been killed in a car wreak. Robert Parks was a voice actor for animated series and one of Known Voices that seemed to be in every. From 2025 he had over 50 major parts and over 500 minor parts, if you counted English dubs of foreign shows, and he was dead from a drunk driver driving one of the last manual cars hitting at 80mph. The Nineties Kids post their video the next day.

The Nineties Kids held a Minecraft funeral about a week after the real funeral and live streamed it to the whole. The streaming site made sure every subscriber and more could tune in. It only 50 million subscribers at the time, but over 200 million tuned in. Most only posting "F" as The Nineties Kids made a grave by putting stone slab with a double chest in the ground filling it with the items he known for. Tools, woods, and jukebox with records.

Sarah Goldback was the next to go. The next year her death wasn't covered by any news outlet. Her only claim to fame was The Nineties Kids and three local blue ribbons for cooking. Her funeral didn't need any special setting to be stream. Few watched. I was one them. She died of heart failure. She was asleep. Her chest was filled with wheat, beard, and cookies.

It was years before the next cool passed away. Tony Parker. A professional DM and writer. His death was report. Liver failure. Another funeral. Potions, books, and other magic items.

After that things got... odd. The videos stopped coming as often, and so did The Nineties Kids. Of course they were all in every video, but more time some disappeared. Mr. and Ms. Whitewood were the first to be noticed in 2071. They haven't been a single video for only a year. Then others started to notice the graves. The graveyard they had made started having more stones. By the end of year there were eight stones, and Paul Leave made an official announcement Mary Dime, Tom Copperhelm, John Freemen, Joseph King, and Diana Whitewood had pasted, and they did not want minecraft funeral.

The next one to go hurt. John Bark's death came soon after a got out of college with a computer science degree. There was a live Minecraft funeral, but only three of the remain seven attended. Paul Leave, Jack Oakland, and Ashley Yellowfelt were in it. Diamonds and logs, every stone and wood they could manage, a stack of steaks, and a single Ender Chest.

Jack Oakland died next. His death was one of worse. His house broken into and beaten with a baseball bat, by his own grandson. Paul held the funeral alone. Saplings, axes, and the golden armor he always worn.

It was, at time, the internet started to break down. While many were respectful and even mournful, others were not and made terrible memes about them. From "bets on croaking days" to just pointing out that many of were born in the 80's. The remain six were being harassed and goated on. This went on and on and nothing could make it better. Not fans pushing back, not public television pleas, not even Steven Whitewood killing a kid.
