When I was eight, I first saw the letters. I had been in the hallway waiting to go out to play when the postlady dropped the usual bills through the door. By the time mom had found my heavy coat, I'd seen the letter with my name on, and ripped it open in a frenzy.

&#x200B;

"See you in 27 years," it said.

&#x200B;

Mom had gone into a panic, and after a hushed conversation with my dad on the phone, they agreed it was time to tell me they'd been coming since infancy. 

&#x200B;

A countdown, if you will. I don't remember much about the conversation. I just remember never going outside to play that day.

&#x200B;

The letters tended to come in winter. Usually in the interval between Christmas and New Year, but it was never precise. 

&#x200B;

When I was eleven, the letter came on Christmas Day: an elderly neighbour said somebody had dropped it through her door, but she could barely read the print. 

&#x200B;

She died four days later.

&#x200B;

When I was nineteen I moved away to study. It found its way to my student house, safe as anything. Same style envelope as ever, same muddy ink, same chunky typewriter. I called home to let them know it arrived. Dad told me mom had had a stroke that morning. 

&#x200B;

We decided it best not to tell her while she recovered.

&#x200B;

I remember thinking before my wedding day, aged twenty-five, that the envelope hadn't arrived that winter. Of course I'd mentioned it to my fianc√©e in passing, when the previous year's letter arrived. The stalker outside of time. She found it fascinating, exciting almost. Perhaps it was inevitable that it was in amongst the gift cards we opened on our honeymoon.

&#x200B;

Our eldest daughter was born two days before the card came. Dad helped me see her, Mom couldn't see much at all by that point. The letter was waiting for me when my in-laws were on hospital duty. The letter was different this year, almost playful:

&#x200B;

*"See you in five years.* 

*And congratulations."*

&#x200B;

Dad found it strange the Author knew about us. It was the first time in thirty years they had broken format. When our second child was born three Novembers later, no such congratulation came. At least mom didn't have to put up with that one. 

&#x200B;

And the final letter. The final one:

&#x200B;

*"See you tomorrow."*

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to make of it. I had expected something on my thirty-fifth birthday but that came and went without incident. My wife was pregnant with our third, and I felt the nature of the letter was a pressure I didn't want to put on her. 

&#x200B;

Or the girls.

&#x200B;

I left a scribbled note that one of *those letters* had gone to my dad's, and I'm helping him report it to the police, since his memory was getting worse. It was a handy lie. I kept my phone on me, but it was switched off.

&#x200B;

I did see my dad, but only to borrow a tent. I told him the letter came again, but not that it was dated for tomorrow. He didn't ask. I'm not sure he put it together. He didn't tend to much these days.

&#x200B;

I hated camping, but I could slum it for two nights. I drove my car and took to a spot twenty miles to the north. I found a lay-by, parked up. It was a quiet little town, barely more than a village. I bought some supplies, a book, and turned my phone off. I would walk two hours and pitch my tent someone away from the roads.

&#x200B;

I had a flashlight. Change of clothes. Warm things. Cash. Three clocks. Everything I needed to stick it out for two days. 

&#x200B;

And the knife, of course. 

&#x200B;

Just in case. 

&#x200B;

Midnight came and went. What time was I supposed to meet the Author? I couldn't sleep, barely getting an hour before daybreak jarred my tired body from its doze.

&#x200B;

I had mental pictures of the Author. A man, old now, somebody who had probably known my family for years before I was born. I probably knew him. There had been times in my awkward adolescence when I had sat inside on a rainy day trying to imagine who I knew that fit the profile. My parents had plenty of family friends, but most we only saw once or twice  a year. I used to stare at the rain droplets racing down the window pane, flicking through mugshots of the stalkers, wondering their names.

&#x200B;

When I hit my twenties, I lost contact with all of them, and none knew my flat, my student homes, my family maisonette. The suspect list went out the window.

&#x200B;

08:25. I ate a ham and cheese sandwich. The meat was sweaty, and I didn't want it to be out for any more hours. I remembered the year the Author wrote added "*congratulations"* to my message. The only clue we ever had. It was fascinating how one word could add so much colour to a blank canvas. Congratulations. They wanted me to do well? They must have been watching closely to know my daughter had been born that day. The letter was franked locally, but we knew from police investigations on the past that was of little assistance. 

&#x200B;

09:33. I had dreaded that the Author would take a shine to my daughter and pass his focus on to her. Really, though, I knew he wouldn't. He couldn't. Our relationship was *ours*, perfect, symbiotic. I almost felt jealous that he had acknowledged somebody else in the annual ritual. 

&#x200B;

*11:11.* Make a wish.

&#x200B;

12:50. Waiting was boring. What if there wasn't anybody today at all? Even if they had traced the car, it was over six miles away. On foot. I could be anywhere. My phone was off. Even if the Author had modern technology to his disposal now, even if he had the police force behind him.... he couldn't track me down that quickly, right?

&#x200B;

13:13. Lucky for some. I was thinking about the knife. If the Author was old now, I'd win in a struggle, if it came to it? I wasn't aggressive by nature, but, could I see it through? Is this was the Author knew? Were they investing three decades into nudging my mind to a certain mindset? Was I becoming paranoid?

&#x200B;

15:06. I wish I had taken more water with me. I longed to go down to the village and buy some more, but I didn't dare. All it took was one misstep and he would track me down. I was certain. There was half a bottle of Diet Coke left. It was enough. I decided a long time ago I wouldn't make this easy for him.

Or her.

&#x200B;

18:40. Maybe it was Death. The Grim Reaper himself had singled me out like in that movie, I had been favoured somehow. Why the hell did I have a knife anyway? Almost certainly I'd impale myself on it, or step on it and bleed out. How long would it take them to find my body? And my wife....

My wife... 

My girls. 

&#x200B;

I gave it another twenty minutes before I turned the phone on. I couldn't keep radio silence any longer. I had fled my pregnant wife and our two young girls in a fit of paranoia. If someone was watching me, watching us, I should meet them head on. This idea I had brewed was falling apart the more I second-guessed myself. But then the messages came. The texts. The voicemails. All queued up in the ether, waiting for my phone to respond:

&#x200B;

" Where are you? I need you to come home. He's **here**."

&#x200B;

The anxiety in my wife's voice dissolved all my plans for hermitage. She was scared. The girls were causing commotion in the background. 

&#x200B;

He had found her, and I stupidly, *stupidly* didn't warn her.
