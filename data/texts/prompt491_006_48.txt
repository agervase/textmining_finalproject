Death watched as the man placed the shotgun to his head, the piercing ring tallying the rapidly diminishing group of living survivors one fewer. 

"Oh come on!" She yelled at the soul sitting in his place as the hollow cask of flesh dropped to the floor. "You were doing so well." Humans had an alarming tendency to choose the quickest and most painless option whenever the apocalypse rolled around. 

Swiftly she swung her scythe though the aether, dragging the soul into the next life the fabric of energies rippled outward.

She swung her way onto the roof and hopped to her perch, watching in the tangible form of a crow. Looking backward to check her 'nest,' a pile of supplies and explosives she could use to curry favour in deciding the survivor's fate. 

The group below were the last that kept their humanity intact held up behind a makeshift barricade protecting the entrance to the old military base. 
They were thankfully well equipped after she went through the trouble of finding a soul with knowledge to open the armoury. 

Her ability to help them was very limited, realistically she could only provide small assistance despite the importance of their survival; As such she was largely tasked with watching and perhaps dropping a grenade to steer them in the right direction. 
She considered them lucky; humanity had come back from worse with less, but like her friend from before they were a melodramatic bunch. If they died she'd just send them on to the next life, but if they all died there'd be no one left for her to send on, and that was a terrifying thought in of itself. 
Existence without a purpose, she'd be stuck watching their bones and cities turn to dust. She had no way to leave and no way to die. It was ironic really, death needed life in order to live - and it was so fittingly tragic.
