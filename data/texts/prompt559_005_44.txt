I sit at the pub, drinking away my disappointment. Boy, I really earned my money today. Feeling confident, I strode into the bar. A few failed attempts at flirting brought me down a couple notches. Maybe I should play a round of cards at the table in the back or place a bet on the ball game on tv. Or maybe I should just call it a night.

A girl comes and sits down next to me. She orders a drink and it magically appears in her hand. She’s pretty, but not unapproachable. I try to decide if I want to flirt with her or just ask for her name. Suddenly, she turns to me.

“I’m Jenna,” she says, “What’s your name?” It takes me a second to register it.

“I’m Michael.” Oh good, she went first. Maybe now we can just talk. We chat for a while, until a song comes on that she seems really into.

“You wanna dance?” She asks over the music.

“Sure.” I try to match her movements, but she’s a lot faster. And smoother. She does this a lot apparently. We dance through a couple more songs, but then my watch beeps. I have to go.

We walk out together, but before I head back to my apartment, she kisses me. We exchange numbers, but I don’t expect to hear from her again. For all I know, she could live on the other side of the world. I open the door to my apartment.

I blink a few times as I remove the VR device. My body is fully rested, and it’s time to go back to my real world job. The technology is based on lucid dreaming, so you can play the game while your body recharges. I spend the day shuffling papers, earning “real” money, and the night fighting monsters, earning “fake” money. In a way, the “fake” world seems more real than the “real” world.

A message appears on my phone. It’s from Jenna. An address downtown. A physical address, and it’s less than five miles from me. Another message pops up.

“I look forward to seeing you in person.”
