Burnt bodies strewn all around me. Bodies, heaps and heaps of them. The mulch and grass I thought I had been stepping on formed into someone's burnt liver, my other foot resting on what I could only hope was not a snake (based on the dried blood around it, I guessed it was not.) My stomach heaved as I hurled onto the floor, the smell just hitting me. It wasn't only the smell. The images. Crows pecking out the demented eyes of the dead. Crows. Black. White slimy maggots writhing inside the bodies I stepped on, feeding and feeding. They would grow and choose the darkness inside the bodies to pupate before becoming flies and spreading their lifeline else where among the corpses I had been charged to clean. I was the government's bitch, and understanding this, I knew it was only time before they put me down like every owner puts down their dying dog. Maniacal laughter filled the air as I cackled, with the images flickering inside my mind of my very body joining those who defied our government. There was only one way to escape them. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. You have it there, in your hand. The very tool they used to clean up their mess, they will use on you too. You know this. Why not do it yourself? We're all feeding grounds for the crows and maggots anyway. Black and white. Yin and Yang. We all end up in their cycle. May as well make it our own choice. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Suffer like they did and fall to the ground, let the others around you notice your choice and question everything around them. Let your cracked lips form a smile, and let them understand the world is not what it seems. We are all feeding grounds, and I no longer want to be the one cleaning.
