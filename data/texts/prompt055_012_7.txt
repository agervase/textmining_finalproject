The face in the mirror was not mine. It looked similar, but the skin was like a dry lake bed and the lips had canyon fissures running through them. 

"Water." It mouthed. 

I heard the voice in my head as if it were my own thought. A familiar voice with an unfamiliar hunger. 

"Water." It groaned. Louder this time. In the increased volume I could feel the sharp desperation and longing in the dancing tones.

I turned the sink tap and threw water at the reflection. Nothing happened. I could feel a fear rising within me. I pooled the water in my cupped hands and drank. The water was like nothing I had ever tasted before. The refreshing clarity trickled down my throat and hung in my gut. I let out a deep sigh, joined in harmony with a voice within. 

The reflection ran its pine-cone tongue across its crumbling lips. "More."

I obliged. Not because of the command, but because I felt it too. The need for more. Again I lifted my hands to my lips and let the ice cold water sooth me. As soon as I swallowed, the great thirst swelled up again. The roof of my mouth felt coarse and my temple began to pound. The reflection didn't need to signal this time, I was already drinking deep. This humdrum tap water tasted like the freshest lake. 

The reflection wasn't getting any less dishevelled though. As I drank repeatedly, it just stood there, breathing heavily. Nothing changed, on that end.

My panic began to set in as I felt an inconsolable itching in my eyes. Between gulps I had taken to rubbing them with my wet fingers for a moments relief. Springs of blood began to sweat from the cracks in my chapped lips. I took one last look at my reflection before bending over and spraying the tap full force into my mouth. Breathing was no longer a priority. I needed the water.
