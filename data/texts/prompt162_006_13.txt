Day 664,823: We wake up.  It is a Thursday in October, year 2018.  I have lived this day for nearly two millennia.  This is the day she will die.  The cause appears different each time, within reason.  It started as a car crash.  Then it became a hit and run.  Engine failure.  A small bird caught in the wheel.  Each permutation resulted in her death while operating a motor vehicle.

When I removed the vehicle from the equation entirely by explaining to her what I have done, and why it was so important for her to not enter a motor vehicle, the vehicles came for her.  She went to retrieve the mail and a van ran her over.  I convinced her to stay indoors, only to be met with further failure.  Faulty kitchen appliances, falling down a flight of stairs, a freak accident involving a spatula.  Clearly, I thought, I needed to confine her to our bedroom.

The incidents only became more outlandish.  A lightbulb exploded, one of the glass shards lodging into her neck.  At one point, the cat murdered her.

Once I had removed these dangers from the equation, she began finding ways to commit suicide.  I vaguely remember in the eleventh century of this day that I attempted to disable her to save her life.  It almost worked, but I wasn’t a medical professional.  I might as well have lodged another piece of light bulb in her neck.

To be honest, her death no longer phases me.  I feel nothing when the light dies in her eyes.  To me, it’s become a part of my daily routine.  Saving her life is no longer my “perfect outcome” as the authorities described it.  I have a higher purpose to strive for.

I’ve chosen to end her life with arsenic today.  The loop will continue so long as she dies by 11:59 PM on October 25, 2018.  I discovered early on that I could leave messages for myself, if I wrote them down and left them out of sight.  In doing so, I’ve discovered such things.  Soon my work will be complete.

Immortality is in my grasp, and on October 26, 2018, I will live forever.
