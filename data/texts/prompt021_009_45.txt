 The dagger shines in the light, gleaming as the moonlight trickles down to the ground. I sheath it back into its holder, the mystical item glowing as always. *Blood dripping silently down my hands.*

  The Earth was always doomed. From the start. Ever since the rise of humanity it was already degrading. While the earth slipped into the cracks of demise, we humans plundered it, not knowing the repercussions. Some argued for us to stop, it was not to late to save the planet, to save humanity from it’s own demise. I was one of those few good people. I told others to listen.

*They did not.*

I run swiftly down the street, eyes darting around, searching for the next person to liberate.

*Or maybe my next victim*

 It seems weird, the feeling I mean, of taking a life. The question of morality lingers at the back of my head. 

  It all seems surreal, how this happened to me, a simple archaeologist. One day I had a dream, a vision of the dagger. It’s smooth razor sharp edges calling me. On my next expedition, I found it buried underground in a burial room. Ancient runes adorning the walls. I picked up the blade, still sharp after all these years.

The dagger does something to a person. Does something *otherworldly*, as if the *soul itself is sucked out* and teleported somewhere else. I don’t know where, but I do know it’s somewhere better than earth.

  I don’t have any reassurances, maybe I’ve done all these killings for no purpose, maybe it’s all been in vain, but I *feel* this is the right thing to do. I *know* it is. Humanity must be saved, and that saviour is me. 

 My footsteps quicken as I hear another person. In this small town on the outskirts of Europe, It’s not hard to find villagers I can save. After the years, I learned to limit the people I brought to the new world. The rich and greedy have nothing to contribute to the new world.

 The numbers are a blur. How many have I killed?

*Hundreds?, Thousands? I don’t dare ask myself *

 I crawl around the back of one of the houses and peer through the window. I see the man now, late 40s, averagely tall, brown hair with saggy dark eyes. I wonder to myself whether this man has a family, has friends, perhaps children. Perhaps I am unrighteously  taking away his life from them. *Does it even matter?* He seems to be working, and I glance closer. He is sketching, a drawing of a child. I force myself to keep looking. He is turned away from me now, an opportunity which I take. In one swift motion, I climb through the door, unsheathe the dagger, and stab him in the back. 

 No sound escapes his body. Eerie silence fills the night. The man stays upright for a split second, still conscious.

*A second that echoes into eternity*

 The man slumps down. Dead. 
Another life saved.

The dagger doesn’t need to kill the person. It sucks the life out of them anyway. That’s how it saves. That’s how I save.

*Saving?, is that what you call the mass genocide you have done?*, The whispers in my head growing louder and louder, like a cyclone of emotions, filling every crack in my mind, until they all stop, and all I hear is deafening silence.

I can’t bear to live with the pain I’ve caused. The lives taken. All I can do is take one more life, one more person. The people on the other side may see me as a hero, but here I am a fugitive. A Criminal. A murderer.

*Maybe the ones I’ve saved don’t even realise I’ve saved them.*

All these atrocities I’ve done, all the lives lost, are actually lives gained, I try to tell myself. But even though I know I am doing this for good, I still feel in the wrong, ashamed.

Women and children, saved by my hand,

*Women and children, slaughtered by my blade.*

Perhaps maybe the dagger hasn’t sucked the life out of the ones I’ve killed, but maybe it’s been sucking out *my life*.

I feel the earth tremble, realization  striking me. *”This must be it”* I whisper silently. The earth was doomed from the start, but perhaps I’ve made my mark on the lives of others, and this world. 

I look down on the blade, glimmering in the moonlight. I don’t even know if all I’ve done was worth it. I don’t even know why I did it. It’s all a blur.

Buildings are starting to crumble as the shaking grows more intense. I almost stumble. Pulling out the blade, I prepare for the worst.* “It’s time”*


* I toss it aside*

I bring out the pistol in my holster, and shoot myself hit the head.
