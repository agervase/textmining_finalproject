>June 14th, 1951.

***"Oh come on, again?"***

Young Donald Trump awakens in bed at 5 years old, and immediately a headache swells in his young head.

***"So many betrayals, so many horribly painful deaths, so much abuse. Damnit, God, when will it end!?"***

Trump is unable to relate his painful memories to others and incapable of ignoring their stinging effects. Any time a new experience reminds him of an old memory, it drives him insane. He sees red. Feels like a gorilla in heat. 

***"Aarghhah!"***

Nearly as incapable of communication as Helen Keller, a psychologically crippled young Trump is sent early-on to military school. 

>August 27th, 1963.

As a student Trump can't help but be reminded of his days in Egypt, learning from Coptic scrolls, creating new ones. He is driven to monosyllabic rage.

***"Make. School. Great. Again!"***

Trump nearly wins election as school president. It is a premonition of times to come. 

Nobody could ever know the horrifically vivid intellectual depth and emotional turmoil of young Donald Trump. Nobody could ever understand his pathological nihilism and puzzling claims of personal greatness. 

As his 1,345th life wore on, Trump would develop a dangerous, violent death wish, masterfully planning to go out for good this time, to take the world with him.

>May 31st, 2017.

Finally, in 2017, the United States is sufficiently convinced that Trump is a moron, and Trump has his finger on the button. He could bring about nuclear winter at any time. He thanks the persistently painful memories of his many past lives for causing him to speak and emote with the affect of a disabled orangutan. This country clearly doesn't trust a cunning mind with this kind of power. 

With the keys to nuclear destruction of the world in his hands, Trump sighs one last heavy, wheezy, coughing sigh.

***"Fuck. Not this. Not now!!"***

Trump feels the familiar pangs of a heart attack. Of all of his previous deaths, the heart attack, in physiological terms, is in the middle, in terms of discomfort. 

Psychologically however, Trump feels a new pain, a deep pain. He giggles at the novelty of it. World destruction is finally in his fingertips, and a heart attack is going to prevent him from making his dream a reality.

Trump squelches-out his 1,345th 'last' words:

***"God damn you McDonalds and your tasty, tasty burgers!!"***

Somewhere on Earth a five-year-old child groans and awakens in bed. 

***"Oh come on. Again!?"***
