Generally, all of the Gods had some unique aspect that set them apart. Phil, for example, split himself into thousands of smaller gods to represent the different aspects of being. Paul, on the other hand, literally walked among his creations, giving them advice and nudging them towards fulfillment. Many gods even swapped creations for a time, or gave some portion of their world to another, just to compare the effectiveness of their ideas.

Despite the fact that deviations were accepted, Bob's world still remained the most controversial. Not a single one of his creations even knew his name, yet they many of the names of the other gods. The little blue planet was to be the ultimate "test site," according to Bob, and he rented parts of it out to the other gods often. His one rule was that no god was allowed to take control of one of his creation's free will; which made sense, since then the gods wouldn't truly be able to test their methods against each other.

"Taylor's the most effective they say." Demeter said in a bitter tone. She had been just been knocked out of the race a few years ago despite teaming up with a few other gods. "I don't like it, but she's got a talent for the subtle manipulations."

"Pfft.." Don snorted. "Taylor's the reason the yer all losing members. Pretty soon you'll have a world of atheist and the experiment will have to be wiped." Don did not take part in the little experiment, but he took a distasteful fascination with it.

"Perhaps," Demeter admitted, "but even so, we've all learned something by it. **You** may benefit by taking a shot there while you can." It was an empty comment. She, and all the other gods as well, knew that Don would never be capable of joining Bob's experiment.

"I've already got all I need," the greasy god started. "I got my own little blue marble to toy with, and all the little beings *think* they have free will. It's practically the same."
