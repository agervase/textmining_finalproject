I knocked on the door. This was the house; I'd heard enough stories of someone knocking on the wrong door, I had to make sure. Idiots. After a few moments, a woman answered the door. "Yes? Can I help you?"

I removed my hat. "I'm... I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am, but... your husband has been in an accident. He's... he's dead, ma'am."

The woman's face changed, but not to a look of horror, as I expected. Tears, sure, screaming, uh huh, but confusion? Not so much. I mean, yeah, sometimes people refuse to believe it, but there's still horror mixed in there. This was... funny. She had laughter in her eyes.

"I'm sorry... that's impossible."

I cleared my throat. "Unfortunately, it's the truth, ma'am. We ID'd the, er, body. Mr. Randall E. Jones, 821 N. Lincoln Lane. That's this address."

She still didn't lose that laughing face. "But... it's impossible, because he's in the kitchen, making dinner!"

She turned to the side, calling over her shoulder. "Honey! Come here for a second."

A moment later, a man poked his head around the door. "Uh, hello?"

I blinked, surprised. That was him, all right; I mean, I hadn't seen the body, but I saw a picture at least. That was Mr. Jones. Right height, right hair, everything. "Uh... I'm sorry. I think there may be a case of mistaken identity. I'm sorry to have bothered you this evening. Mrs. Jones. Mr. Jones."

I nodded to them, replaced my hat, and returned to the vehicle. My partner must have seen the confusion in my eyes.

"What's up? You were gone too long for there to have been nobody home."

I shook my head. "Weirdest thing. Mr. Jones is... well, he was making supper."

Jerry raised his eyebrows. "What? The dead guy? Uh... you wanna run that by me again?"

I nodded, taking a deep breath. "Yeah, the dead guy. Or, I guess, the actual guy, who looks like the dead guy, but isn't the dead guy. Maybe the dead guy is his twin brother or something. His wife must've thought I was nuts."

"Wait - wife? Mrs. Jones?"

He opened his laptop and started typing. I nodded, too preoccupied with my own thoughts to recognize the concern in his.

"What did she look like?"

I described her. Average height, slim build, brown hair, blah blah blah. Jerry coughed the way he does when he's nervous as he turned his laptop towards me. There, on the screen, was a picture of Mrs. Jones. I figured Jerry just queried her driver's license, or something. "Yeah, that's her. Uh... why?"

He shut the laptop. "Frank, she was there too. Dead. Both of them. Robby texted me when you were coming back. One body-double I could grasp, but two? No way this is real. No way!"

I stared at him. "But... then who...?"

He didn't have a chance to answer; a knock sounded at my window. Turning, I saw a blue uniform, and a familiar voice saying, "Excuse me, boys, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the car."

I didn't have a chance to. A bullet hit me square in the chest, and the world started fading to black.

Weirdest thing...

I never expected the last face I'd see would be my own.
