As he started his journey, he could feel the light fading and coldness rising up his bare body. It was time. He knew this moment would come. He had been waiting for it since the beginning of time. He had done his duty well. It was hardly simple. There were times when he thought of ending it. But he could not walk away from his duty. He didn’t want to disappoint the Creator. This duty was given to him by the Creator. He didn’t want this one. He had wanted to other one. But it was not up to him. The Creator had made his choice and they had to abide by it. And now, there was one last thing to do. I'm prepared to face him, he reassured himself. 
‘I'm here' he said. 
‘Hello, old pal! Miss me much?’ said the other one. He hadn’t changed. 
‘You knew this moment would come eventually. We cannot disobey him.’ 
‘Of course we can! We have to be together brother. If I go, so do you and I know you don’t wanna end this. In that pitiful job of yours, taking care of my failed experiments, you started to feel. Somewhere deep down, you felt for those poor souls. And now you need them to find meaning for your existence.’
‘I did what was necessary. But now our time is up. We have to go back. Th…’
‘Go back?! (chuckles) You still don’t understand do you brother. They hate me! They have never loved me in this realm. They had never appreciated what I had given them. And now on the other side, they hate me for it. But just wait till you see my new creation. I am not going back! I am starting to have way too much fun here. You can’t stop me. I have become stronger and powerful. I must be getting back to my work. Ciao!’
He knew it would come to this eventually. It wasn’t the first time. More or less they all turned away from their duty. This one was no different. He closed his eyes. It was done. As he carried the last soul, he couldn’t help but wonder why it was always life that kept changing while he was constant. The Creator must be waiting. Waiting for his 1843824 th subject.
