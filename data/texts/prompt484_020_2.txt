A smile spread across my face. It wasn’t a happy one, everyone around me knew as much. The few people that were still out on the streets were also like me. We accepted our fate. There were some that tried to run, either as far down or as far away as possible. Of course the only ones that would actually manage to prolong their lifes by more than a few hours were the ones on EXPLORER-1. A spaceship originally created by an ambitious entrepeneur that had been taken into custody by the American government when they found out about the “rouge” planet. 

People had given it the most stupid name at the end, when their lives were on the line. Probably had something to do with the fact that they didn’t believe it. The planet Mars, also known as the red planet, had suddenly changed its orbit around the sun to intersect with that of earth. It went rogue. Rouge looks like red and is spelled similiarly to rogue, hence the “rouge” planet Mars. 

I picked up some of the crisps I had been saving up, since there was no way in hell anyone was going to man the grocery stores, and threw them in the air to catch them with my mouth. It stopped. In mid-air, there was now a salted and fried slice of potato just kind of…. hanging there. When I looked around, something strange had happened to everyone around me. They were just there, as if frozen in time. A burning sensation suddenly spread across my arm, and with it text appeared. “However long it takes, save us.”

The smile disappeared from my face. Looks like I wasn’t going to be able to let it end just yet, not when I’d have to take others with me to do so.
