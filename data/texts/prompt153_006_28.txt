“Excuse me. Do you have any Gay Uppoun?” Larry put his hands over his eyes and cursed under his breath then muttered, “grey poupon, grey poupon.” Removing his hands from his eyes, he realized he was no longer in the limo, but rather in a fluorescent-lit office of rather drab appointment. “Uh, cut? Bill, I can take it again if... you... where’s Bill? What happened?”

“Mr. Williams, my name is Samantha. This is never easy to explain, so please relax. The first thing you need to know is that nothing truly bad can or will ever happen to you again. You have been murdered. A commercial director intentionally crushed you with a lighting rig. Apparently you kept saying ‘gay uppon’ instead of ‘grey poupon.’ Unfortunately this director was shockingly homophobic, and very sensitive to the consonant sound you were making when you added that extra P in there. Misphonia, I believe it’s called. The point is, you’re dead, and because you were having a mental glitch at the moment of your death, we couldn’t place your consciousness in another mortal reality because it would have in turn caused our system to glitch. How do you wish to proceed?”

Larry froze. Samantha, used to this reaction began filing paperwork. Seven and a half minutes later, Larry asked, “I’m dead?”

“That’s what I just told you. Well, not just. But it was close to the last thing I said. How do you wish to proceed? That’s an entirely open ended question, mind you. Think of it as a settlement for our failure to relocate your consciousness.”

******* I’m going to be late for work. I just wanted to sieze on a typo creatively instead of being super mean. I was terrified of this idea when I was a kid, and also the sound of a really hard P makes me shudder. The letter and the liquid.
