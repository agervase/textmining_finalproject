Captain Seelig sat at the computer, having just keyed in the message just as the ambassador had told him to do. 

"Do not send rescue." It sounded so....ominous. 

"Ambassador, everything you've shown us over the last 48 hours has been so spectacular - the subterranean cities, the cold fusion generators, the....I can still only think of them as camouflage fields. It's beyond what we...what I dreamed of after the first time seeing your planet through a telescope. Why can't we let the people of Earth know how far your people are ahead of us?" 

"You know the answer already. Look at what happened when we arrived at your camp. Those tall ones, with their harsh words and scared eyes. They wanted to hurt us. You stopped them, that's how we knew we could trust you." the voice, like a song sung by a hundred voices echoed through his mind. "Your people aren't ready. They would never trust us." 

"You're wrong!" Captain Seelig shouted, not in anger but in passion, wanting to defend the people of his home planet "There are those among us who fear the unknown, but there are also those who know that the only way we can evolve is to push through that fear, and to face what is on the other side!"

"You will show them Bill. You will be our ambassador. You need only to take the last step. The tools are in your hands." the voice was softer now, somehow a crowd of whispers "Use them. Embrace your destiny as our first Ambassador to the Earth."

Captain Seelig smiled. Only his Mother called him "Bill" - he was "Will" or "William" to everyone else. He took the pistol that was in his hand and without hesitating, put the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. 

Finally, they were alone again.
