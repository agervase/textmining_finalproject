Sorry

I was secured inside the structure that rested in the middle of the room. I was a little nervous about the opaque glasses on my eyes and the restrains on my limbs. Shortly after I was secured in place I felt my body impulsed back and then gyrate in all directions, and then... nothing.  

I felt as if nothing had happened, apart from a small nausea and the discomfort I was feeling from the position my body was in, I was certain the experiment had failed. I never had much faith in it succeeding anyways, but if they want to pay me just to wear a gown and agitate me a little, who was I to refuse?  

I was about to say something when I felt my body being tilted from the side and upwards very slowly. It felt good not having my head point towards the floor anymore. Then I reached a vertical position. I waited. I'm a patient person ever since I did that rage control therapy, no point in losing patience when this will take as long as it takes anyways.  

I felt a nervous hand around the strip of the glasses, tampering with them and remove them delicately. It took me a couple minutes until the light didn't hurt my eyes and I could open them. I saw just one single word in front of me, written across the glass: Sorry. Sorry for what? I thought, but then I saw the bodies, piled on their chairs behind the glass, another on this side, laying on the floor with an empty open hand.  

Then I remembered the hand removing the glasses and I got nervous. A voice said: "I'm sorry, I'm really sorry." The voice was kind of familiar, but could not remember where had I heard that tone before, probably one of the lab technicians that helped with the restrains. "I had to do it, you must understand, I had no choice, I had to do it, please understand." Understand? Understand what? This maniac had gone berserk and killed everyone! What did he want from me? Was he going to kill me too? I had one chance, though, one single opportunity, unbeknownst to everyone I had smuggled my old lucky knife and I had it attached on my hip. One hand, that's all I needed, one free hand and a bit of luck.  

-Please say something, please talk.  
-What do you want?  
-I just need you to understand. I had no other option.  
-Let me free and we can talk about it.  

I felt his trembling hands messing with the strip holding my right hand from behind, while he continued rambling on about something. I wasn't paying attention. This was my opportunity. A rush of adrenaline, my hand jumping to my side, opening the blade in a flash and stabbing backwards in a blind movement. A cry of surprise and then a thump and heavy breathing.  

While I was untying the rest of my limbs he continued speaking and rambling, "I'm an idiot, I should have known, can't believe this shit happened..." I turned around and he said his last words: "I'm sorry, I didn't want to die". My knife was locked between his neck and his shoulder, my own face dropped inert on the other shoulder.

Sorry for any mistake I made, English is not my first language.
