The time had come, my work was almost done.

There was nothing left. All intelligent life has withered away, the planets were crunched into dust and where the stars once shone, there was nothingness. I examined the this dark abyss, relishing that my long eternal job was finally coming to an end.

Except I had one more soul to claim, the last spark of this forsaken universe, it literally represented life. I find it ironic that my last job was to finally remove life from this universe and then and only then, will it truly be become a vast empty void of nothingness, the type that would have driven any intelligent life form insane thinking about it.

I approach this lone spark, it sees me and does not resist as I approach. " It is time.... " I stated ".... to come home, to end life and time once and for all " The spark looked at me with a blank stare, was it accepting it's fate?

" Entropy " It replies to me " It really can't be reversed, can it? "

" You have spent your entire existence trying to defeat me. No one has ever liked death. Seemingly limitless cultures have tried to cheat it, to comes to terms with it but in the end, we all must die. " The spark looks dejected " Do not be sad, old friend, while you may be leaving this behind, you will finally see what lays beyond. "

The spark, now accepting it fate, grabs my hand and with that, we depart this void, closing the doors on it for the last time.

I never realised that there was something left behind when I shut the door..... something in hyperspace.... that would ultimately undo my work.

" Let there be light! "
