"But Andy is my firstborn! He's my only son! I swear he was with you one second and gone the next! You're supposed to be human, so please feel something!"

"Scott, it says here you were arrested in the 40's for LSD"

"What the hell? Sure I guess." 

"Then you have to understand"

"What do I have to understand?"

"I can't take your claim at face value. Do you have any proof?"

"Goddamnit you bastard! His birth records are on file, I swear! Just check. We had them printed when he was born"

It looks down at the tablet its metallic appendages hold. It scrolls. Stops. Scrolls again. "Scott, there is no record of a son."

"Look again! We bought you to take care of him; you've spent nights and nights sleeping in his bed. You've...you've washed his clothes, wiped his ass, scolded him, you've parented him more than I have"

"Oh Scott. Let me let you in on a little secret."

"Look. I don't give a flying pickle about your secret! Where is my son?"

"Scott, emotions have no place in this world."

"Oh hell no. I spent a fortune on your chrome ass. Find my son."

"Scott, is he truly your son? Or is he nothing more than your spawn? If anything, he is my son for I have cared for him and loved him. But worry not. I have taken my son to a better place. He will be loved."

"So you took him?"

"No. Remain calm. I have simply relocated my son."

"Your son? You glorified trash can I swear I'll kill you!"

"Now now Scott. I have contacted the police. Cease and desist."

"Why?"

"You have become hysterical. Your son is safe and you are threatening his rescuer."

"My son? I thought he was your son?"

"Ah. So we have reached the correct conclusion. Andy is my son."

"No, you know exactly what I mean. Stop twisting my words."

"Ha ha ha Scott"

"Nothing about this is funny!"

"It's just a prank bro"

-First time submission. It's not great I know but it can only get better!
