Well, as they said I'm Bob and I'm new management. 

I know a lot of you had some pretty bad experiences with God. I can't blame you but you have to understand that most of what we do is managing the rest of the galaxy. There are hundreds of billions of stars and planets in this galaxy, and paying attention to all of them is pretty difficult. For the most part management doesn't get involved in the outcomes of biological life. However the new CEO things we should turn over a new leaf and start focusing more on the biological aspects of the multiverse, less on managing the inorganic parts. 

So as part of my regime I'm adding complaint boxes everywhere. Problem is what everyone wants contradicts what everyone else wants. I keep getting messages from humans to destroy the HIV virus, but the HIV virus keeps giving me messages to stop all those anti-retroviral drugs that are making it hard for them to reproduce. The lions want more gazelles to eat, but the gazelles want the lions to stop eating them. The communists want to rid earth of the fascists, but the fascists want to rid earth of the communists. The frogs want more flies, the flies want fewer frogs. 

As you can see, there really is no easy answer. So here is what I am going to do as the new district manager. I'll send reports to my higher ups that I'm helping out the biologics, but I'll just let you all keep doing what you're doing. Survival of the fittest and all that. There really is no way I can help all of you because what each of you wants tends to be the opposite of what others of you want. 

So we'll just keep going with the old ways, but I'll send up reports every few million years saying the new way is working. Glad to make your acquaintance.
