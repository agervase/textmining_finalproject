Alright, my first go at one of these, so criticism is appreciated.

"What's that?!" My alien shipmate yelled.

"This," I replied, "is called a gauss rifle... Or a rail gun! I'm not quite sure which."

"I thought you were going to fix our ship! Not create a weapon with the last parts of our ship that worked! You'll get us both killed!"

"What do you mean?"

"You do realize that outside there are highly trained soldiers waiting for us to attack them? That they have energy shields? That we already have guns?"

"Of course I do! That's why I made this! They'll be expecting us to either fly away or attack them with our energy weapons. With this I can use any piece of scrap of metal as a shot, and it will go through their energy shields."

"How are we getting off of the planet then? It's a warzone! We can't just go to a space dock and fly away!"

"Easy! We steal one of their ships!"

"And how are we going to do that"

"With this beauty of science" I say as I hold up the gauss rifle. "By the way I should mention it doesn't work..."

"WHAT!"

"I kinda used up all the batteries that still had charge testing this. Don't worry I have a plan!"

"Oh no, not another one of your 'hair brained human schemes' that somehow work..."

I quickly jump up and peek out the hole in the hull of our ship, and out at the soldiers, I then jump out shouting "STAY BACK, I HAVE A RAILGUN". I can tell the soldiers are startled, both by my railgun, but more importantly, my race. Then I quickly tell my shipmate "get those fire crackers I've been saving! They're my plan!"

"Damn human is gonna get me killed someday..."
