They had arrived.
The world's nations fell quickly.
The communist countries, the Middle East and Russia put up a good fight now that I think about it.
And **Putin riding a bear into battle while duel-wielding AKs and fueling his rampage with vodka** was the most stereotypically Russian thing I had ever seen.
Also, it was **fucking hilarious.**
The democratic countries however were still discussing how to deal with the invasion when the aliens entered the conference room, and exterminated them like they were wasps.
Can you believe they thought the aliens would negotiate!?

Eventually us redditors were the only ones left.
That was when the declaration was signed.
All subreddits put aside their differences and formed the most effective military the world would ever see.
r/MURICA supplied weapons, and ho boy, did they have a lot of firepower.
The 100% FLESHY HUMANS of r/totallynotrobots were like tanks on the battlefield.
The soldiers from the battlefield subreddits were brilliant fighters and tacticians, and the CoD players were effective guerrilla units, thanks to their endless hours of training spent camping.
The pilots of r/titanfall **actually built actual titans**
(I immediately went with a tone) and crushed many an alien with their MLG parkour skills and falling titans.
The food-based subreddits like r/pizza kept the soldiers fed, and r/memes was a brilliant source of morale.

However, the best fighters were the lads of r/Inglin, who were angry that her majesty had been shot (she managed to survive, the woman is practically immortal I tell you).
You could hear them singing God save the Queen as loud as they could while mowing down the aliens with spitfires, lancasters and **patriotism even the Americans couldn't beat**.
(When the war ended, the British empire was restored, with some minor changes in that they gave up the colonies in Asia for America.)

The 100% bipedal humans of r/totallynotaliens reversed their role, and became spies.
The men and women of r/DIY were invaluable, as they repaired and rebuilt ruined military installations.
The aliens, despite their superweapons were no match for the missile-laden cyclopses provided by r/subnautica, which were like the wolfpacks of the second world war.

All in all, the aliens were beaten, even though their weaponry was over a century away from ours.
They had been defeated by a collection of amateur and professional chefs, some guys in sheds, gamers, Dat Boi and radial thirds.
We knew they would be back, and that next time they wouldn't fuck around.
But neither would we.
That wasn't even our final form.
Next time, we would have r/Xcom.
