"Going for the third base already?"

With a smile on my face, I shot the zombie who just tried to bite me right between the eyes with Ebony, and then I put another bullet in it for good measure with Ivory. I kick the lifeless...well, it was lifeless to begin with so I think that "inanimate" is a better term, against two others and dash towards them, stabbing them repeatedly with my sword, mincing them.

And I have no problem doing so, despite the fact that part of me knows that, until a couple hours ago, they were just like me, walking around and having fun around this Comicon.

But most of me is no longer "me".

I don't know how it happened. One minute I was posing with other capcom cosplayers, and the next I was cutting Mr. X head while jumping over him and did a quick dance number with his hat. If you knew me, you'd know that the whole dance routine is most surprising thing for me to do, considering how hopelessy bad I used to be at dancing.

We "good" cosplayers immediately moved to help those without any costume on. We escorted them out of the buildings, but others were waiting for us. You know what's worse than a Sephiroth? Try fighting three of them, in full One Winged Angel mode.

Thankfully, one of them started monologuing and we managed to understand what was happening.

Props and toys were the first to turn. It all started when a guy cutted the wrist of his friends with his toy lightsaber and another one impaled himself on his. Foam swords suddently became very heavy and people in zombie make-up started to rot.

I think I'm one of the lucky ones. Not only did a cosplay a badass good guy on demigod levels, but he was also mostly human so the transiction was painless. But now I understand that the screams I heard were not part of any show. I can't even imagine the feeling of having your skin rot and fall off of your face.

"Please, if you are one of the good guys, please listen. East Wing is currently besieged by the 501st. If you have a weapon that can fight against lightsabers, I beg you, go and support them. We only have mid and low tier there."

&#x200B;

Oh, I almost forgot. We managed to get one of staff member to what's now the control room, and he does his best by keeping track of what's happening and telling us using the speakers. We left a couple of Wolverines and a Master Chief with him, with a Prince Noctis nearby.

I am pretty close to the east wing, and I really want to go. Somehow I know my demon arms will handle lightsabers pretty well. I make my way knocking yet another Slutty Harley Quinn out of commission.

She's lucky I was the one who found her, because my brother does not share my view on "not killing human...wait...it's not my brother...I never met the guy before today..

*"Where are you going, Dante?"*

&#x200B;

I'm not D...

&#x200B;

*"You hear the man, there's a party starting over there and I just got my invitation."*

&#x200B;

*A red skinned, horned tattoed freak with a red lightsaber jumps in front of me. I rest my sword over my shoulder, looking at him.*

&#x200B;

*"So, it's that kind of party, isn't it?"*

&#x200B;

*He lifts his hand, and I feel a strong force pushing me back, but I stab my Sword into the ground and hold my position.*

*I smile at him, this guy may actually be fun.*

&#x200B;

*"Let's get this party started."*
