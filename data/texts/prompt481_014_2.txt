I woke up in bed by the sound of my alarm, boy last night must have been crazy can't really remember anything, went to the bathroom and saw my hands stained with paint, curious I went to the studio to see what have I painted in my black out, as soon as I turned the lights I saw the canvas beautiful greens on top, striking reds in the bottom, astonishing blues on the sides, and whole lot of brown in the middle didn't really get it it was like the whole painting was out of focus, confused I put it aside, maybe I could sell it as a piece of modern art, the day went by in a hurry didn't really do much either, next day the same painting in a new a canvas only this time it looks a little bit more detailed I can recognize some of the greens as a couple of trees and bushes some of the reds looked like kind of cloth the blues I thought were the sky on the side and browns still looked out of shaped, I wonder why do paints this my sleep and something inside felt weird about the whole situation, another day went by without me noticing. 
Next day I woke up at noon didn't even heard my alarm I'm in the bath the water is warm like I have just gotten in, I quickly got out not remembering how I've got there I try to remember what I did last night nothing comes to mind something inside me felt horribly wrong, suddenly I heard I little voice inside my head telling me " do you remember going to sleep at all" I realize I don't remember going to sleep try to recall what I did the day before and can only think that it went awfully fast anything else, I found my self going to the studio in the middle of my confusion, I turned on the lights and I am really afraid to look at what I've done this time is clear and I recognize this view I seen it a million times and its clear what I've done I call 911 immediately. 

- this is 911 how may I assist you today 
* yeah ummm I think there's been a horrible accident on rural route 68, fifteen minutes north out Pitluck town. 
-sir please stay where you an ambulance is on the w.. 
*no, send the cops no one is alive in there and please tell them I don't know what I did but I know I'm guilty and I'm afraid I'll do it again. 
-sir what is it that you do... 

I hung up the phone better not trouble this poor little girl, the cops will be outside my door in about 20 minutes, I looked at the painting one last time before going out and face what is outside my door and wait for the cops, it's the best work I've ever made and the best I'll ever do, it's sad this is my master piece the details are perfect the colors I can see them every time I close my eyes and the whole scene will forever be inside my head I will never be able to forget it nor will the 4 police officers that answer the call for an erratic man in the woods outside of town, I open my front door and there it is just like in the painting I just sat in the flimsy plastic chair by the front porch and wait for the cops I can see some of them still bleeding, the beautiful reds of the painting come to me, I can see the trees and the bushes perfectly capture in the painting, I hear a faint siren in the distance, they are coming maybe five minutes away, it's always so quiet in the forest, I can see the lights they are almost here. 
The two patrol cars stopped the poor little Sheryl open her door and immediately vomit and started crying, she shouldn't be a police officer she isn't cut out for it. Bill screams at me, I don't understand what he is saying, I put my hands in the air and turn my back to them Bill comes to me and arrests me turns me around. 

-you sick motherf***** why did you do it 
*Bill I really don't want to talk about it 
-you are going to get the chair boy 

Sheryl shouted "Jessica" I just started laughing Bill punches me in the gut, i don't stop, she is still screaming why you do this, I really don't know. 

I look up to Bill "please don't destroy the painting" he walks away to call who ever you call when have this much cleaning to do, in total seven bodies, it is Sunday, all of them cut in seven pieces, it is Sunday, all of them perfectly arranged in the shape of the number seven, it is Sunday, and in my head it will forever be the same Sunday.
