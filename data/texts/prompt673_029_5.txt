Her hair was greying, her pearlescent skin started to dull, the eyes slowly losing their spark. The last living ones passed a few hours prior; all that remained now was the few microbes and plants. Life gazed around as the final group of stars dimmed. I watched her as she gave them one final impossibly bright shine; she smiled while they winked out from existence one by one. Her smile was sad. It was the most simple way to describe it. Sad, but blessed with acceptance.

"It was beautiful. Thank you." I spoke with a whisper. 

"Thank you for letting the last of them go peacefully. You didn't have to."

"Why make them suffer? I led them without pain, and showed them they had nothing to fear."

"Isn't that against the rules?" We both chuckled softly. There was no one left alive to worry about the other side. "Do you think they did well?"

The question was expected, but I hadn't really thought about it. I sighed, "You know I can't really judge them. Focus on the fact that so many made it to the end. Over a dozen sapient species. They didn't even fight with each other, how rare was that?"

"Too rare, since you are surprised. I didn't create them though, so it's not my place to comment. Do you feel that?" I did. The last of the Universe wanted to finish, collapse back to a singularity. It had to wait for us to finish.

"Let's hope our creator doesn't take as long to design the new life next time." 

"I'm sure they will be fantastic." Life smiled at the thought. 

We were finished for a time. There was no more life, so there was no need for her. So there is no need for me as well. We clasped our hands together and smiled for a moment. We hugged as both our Essences joined into the ether, patiently waiting for the new universe to be born and our purpose restored.
