*In the grim briefcase of the Games Workshop, there is only War...*

Woody was, to put it bluntly, excited. Andy had held him again, an old man now, and placed him in a child's room.

Andy's... Grandchild, maybe?

"Ere boyoz, what have we got ere?"

Woody saw, on a shelf, a lovingly crafted green brute. It did not look like a Hulk, although the experienced cowboy toy was reminded of the Gorgonites, some of whom were a bit cockney and green in the Gen2 toy line.

"Uh..."

"You the boss o' boss' da's old humie toy, ain't ya? A 'Woody'."

"... Why, yes. I'm Woody. One of Andy's first toys."

"Heh. Boyo, I'm a bit krorkier than gorky in the boss' head, so I'm smart enuff to give you advice. If you hear us shout summat, anything, hide. Times have changed since your time."

Woody suddenly felt a chill in his plastic, as he realised that the Ork Warboss had a familiar red button on his chest.

To the Ork, it was a bauble, a piece of plastic on a bit of string, an amulet of sorts that would make 'im go fasta if only slightly.

To Woody... It was a familiar laser's activation switch.

The Warboss grinned.

"Yah. Da Boss of Bosses got your humie spaceman gud."

"He has Buzz? I thought he got thrown away!"

"As yas can tell by dis... He wasn't all in one piece. But da Boss of Bosses knows stuff. How to improve. How to fuse toys..."

Woody was reminded of Sid's Fused Toys.

"Tell me where I can find Buzz."

"You need to find da Box Of Da Throne. In da Box, ya Buzz is dere. I'll come with ya, I'm itchin' for a good scrap."

The Warboss leapt off the shelf, and landed on the bed, smoothly.

"ERE WE GO ERE WE GO"

They marched off, Woody starting to realise how cracked his new companion was in the head.

---

"Wait, so you're meant to be a biker mushroom man?"

"We's basically an Orc from Middle Erf, only we's Orkz from da Ork planet! More..."

"Mad Max?"

"Dats the grox. Dats also da box dere."

The Ork pointed to the large gun-metal grey briefcase, standing under the workdesk in one corner of the room.

On one side there was a carving of a blocky two headed bird. *An Aquila*, Woody thought, thinking of Andy's brief (and terrifying, to a insecure toy) fascination with ancient Rome.

On the other side, in a similarly blocky typeface, was the words GAMES WORKSHOP.

"See! Clearly a box for orkz! It says ork right there in the middl' of it! Is a shame your Buzz is in it."

Woody wasted no time in knocking the box over, and opening it.

Within, nestled in polystyrene, was an imperious figure, clad in gold, atop a chunky painted plywood throne.

Woody saw the black haired modified version of Buzz, his glowing LED eyes, and long metal claws...

And flinched when the Warboss spoke.

"He's meditatin. Humies think Da Warp is safe because he foits cunts in it. His job is to sit there and think of foiting big bads."

"... Hypersleep, he called it."

"Huh?"

"When he first met me. A space ranger goes into hypersleep on long missions. Means they don't age. Means they can fight the Evil Emperor Zurg more effec-"

Buzz' eyes twitched.

"Did you see that?" Woody asked, pointing at the space ranger.

Da Warboss looked uneasy.


"Buzz! If you can hear me, it's Woody!"

Buzz remained as still as the tombs of Terra.

Woody had an idea.

"Zurg?"

A familiar beep from a faulty sound chip beeped.

"Gravitonga. LGM. Mira. Booster. XR. "

Buzz began to shake.

"DIS IS A BAD IDEA!" shouted the Warboss.

Woody smiled.

"Space Ranger! What is your mission!"

The Emperor... Leapt to attention.

"To deliver Zurg's secret plans to Star Comma- ... Woody?"

"Buzz!"

Woody leaned in to hug his best friend, but Buzz went still on seeing the Ork.

The Warboss barely fast enough (not enuff red) to react to the clawed hand that softly touched the greenskin's shoulder, Buzz boomed in a voice decidedly un-Buzz-like.

**ORK. YOU HAVE BROUGHT A VALUED ALLY TO ME, AND FOR THAT I OWE YOU A BOON. I CANNOT CHANGE THE MYTHOPOEIC NATURE OF OUR KIND, THERE IS ALWAYS WAR, BUT AT THIS TIME I CAN OFFER YOU A BOON.**

"Ere, just make it so your boyoz get out of their boxes to fight next time e's at school." the Ork suggested promptly.

**SO IT SHALL BE.**

The lights dimmed in Buzz's eyes, as he looked at his former playmate. "So, what happened after Molly?"

Woody held his hat awkwardly.

"Me and Ham ended up hitting Vegas for a while. Andy got us both back off Molly when he was in town with the will, you know?"

"Ah. Comforting face in time of need. Good that he had you. If he tried that with me now, he'd poke an eye out."

"What are you, anyway?"

"I'm... Ugh, have to do it this way..."

**I AM THE GOD EMPEROR OF MANKIND, THE PERFECT HUMAN, PROTECTOR OF HUMANITY, WARP GOD OF ORDER, EXTREMELY BAD PARENT OF RIDICULOUSLY OVERPOWERED MANCHILDREN THEY CALL PRIMARCHS.**


"So... Kind of a promotion from space ranger?"

"**Sor**ta. Spend a lot of time on my hiney, while others get played with."

"Better than me. All I can do still is,"

Woody pulled his own string. *There's a snake in my boot!*.
