"Listen child, you prayed to me. You're the first person to pray to me intently and willfully in centuries. The first to have an ounce of faith. I'm here to help you and help I shall. Well, as soon as I shake some cobwebs off. Got anything to drink? No? You call yourself a writer and you're sober? Damn, how the profession has fallen."

The chatty man muttered to himself poking through James' cabinets and fridge. James was desperate. He'd hit a brick wall on his thesis. No amount of exercises could help him. The words wouldn't come and he couldn't think his way around them. So he did what anyone would do in absolute desperation. He prayed.

-----------------------------

He had prayed to the god of his baptist faith for days. He had prayed to any number of gods he could find. Finally he found one in a Norse mythology book. He prayed to Bragi, with all of his heart. He had assembled an altar as best he could. It wasn't much; a few books, a sandwich and a jar of olives. What could one expect of a broke college student though?

It was about an hour later and this disheveled older man in a bowling shirt, khaki shorts and a worn pair of New Balance climbed out of a Buick in front of his duplex. He knocked on the door and welcomed himself in when James opened it to see what he wanted. The man walked to the alter and tut'ed a bit and made a fuss of the sandwich. He sat down across the table from where young writer had been working. 

"You called me and here I am! How can I assist a *faithful* follower such as yourself?" The old man smugly smiled as he ate the bacon sandwich.
