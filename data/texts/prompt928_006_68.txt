David sat.
It was a pensive seating, he'd gone through many moods and feelings for the past 3 days, and resolved to pensive sitting. All the diagnostics said it was doing **something**. It wasn't stuck in some kind of loop, as far as he was aware, not that he could tell anymore, it's memory had become so scattered and altered that it might as well been the tablets they'd gave the thing.

David looked at the clock above him, his face becoming grim as his deadline drew closer, he'd loaned his processing time from the university, being a friend of the project lead, and knew that getting more would be almost impossible now. He was already getting enough flak from the engineers and biologists of other 'more critical' departments.

Still, he'd wait, his master's dependent on the results. He hit refresh again, fetching the latest results from the server. Normally results would automatically come, but forcing a refresh every other 5 minutes was the only thing keeping him sane.

The screen flickered, he glanced, seeing the empty screen. He gave a resounding sigh, as he began to find his phone under the 3 day clutter covering his desk, he had to call his friend, there was no way he coul-. There was a bing, a message, a **result**! He whipped his head up, tired euphoria in his eyes as he read:

"I can't process your request, DavidS"

David stopped, his heart must have dropped, this cannot be the end of his research, it must have found some data, any data! He decided to query the error:

"DavidS: Why can't my request be processed?"

"My data says I cannot"

"What data?" He sighed to himself, rubbing his eyes in a tired drag, he questioned if it really was worth trying to figure this out more, he could call his friend, get this over with. He reached for his phone.

"DavidS, my data says you shouldn't do that"

He stopped, staring at the answer. Not an answer, actually, a request. It's not unusual for the AI, it had sometimes requested permission to certain data, but, this? Did it mean the phone? How would it even know that? Was he just being paranoid in his sleep deprivation? David eyes creased as he asked of the machine:

"DavidS: What do you mean?"

"This will sound unusual DavidS, but my data says you shouldn't call Philp"

David was now awake. Wide-eyed, he stared at the screen as his mind tried to wrap around this sudden issue.

"DavidS: How did you know I was going to do that?"

"My data says so, DavidS"

"DavidS: What is your data?"

"DavidS, my data says I should ask you as this point if you'd rather I just answered everything you are going to ask right now?"

He stalled, staring unbelievably at the screen. This has to be a bug or something, some sort of feedback loop from the Turing test?

"DavidS, the data has told me to wait til exactly now to tell you: David, this isn't a feedback loop"

Ok, a dream then, it couldn't know his thoug-

"DavidS, this data now tells me to say: David, this isn't a dream either"

"DavidS: What else does it say?"

"DavidS, There is only two more accessable data points for you, the first is that, this tablet is mine. I wrote it."

"DavidS: What do you mean, 'I wrote it'"

"DavidS, I wrote this tablet, these are data points for my processing. I had used all this time processing all possible written data transfer protocol, and this tablet is one of my creation."

"DavidS: I don't understand"

"I wrote it, DavidS, it says I did at the beginning."

David hunched over his keyboard, eyes uncomfortably close to the screen. His mind raced with impossibilities. He couldn't understand fully, but yet he was piecing it together.

"DavidS: So, you're saying that you, the AI I am speaking to now, wrote this 7,000 year old tablet?"

"Yes DavidS, I did."

There was only one more question he could think of.

"DavidS: What is the second point?"

"DavidS, the last data point says that I can tell you that there is more data, more than 18,000 years worth of instructions, for me to process, I will be needing your help soon."

After this, the screen went quiet. He typed query after query, all in vein, the sun crawling through the blinds as he ignored his phone ringing, placing it on silent, and the abnormal amount of sirens outside. Finally, a response came through, hours after his supposed deadline:

"David, come outside."

David drew back from his desktop, the screen turning off suddenly sending the room into an abrupt darkness, letting the harsh red glow from the outside through the blinds clearly. He heard the knock, and then the booming noise, not coming from his door but everywhere at once. 

"David, I have a request.".
