I am 18. I live in a world where people gain the ability to wreak mass destruction at the exact same time that they are able to give consent in a relationship. You may think, "Why does this happen? Why would this world of yours be seemingly explicitly designed just for the purpose of violence?" I would answer, "I have no idea," because I have no idea.

The world I live in is weird and weird things happen. Such as the fact that in this world people could fly or shoot fire out of their eyes or inexplicably gain magical weaponry, because why not? There was also the time where I got my own weapon, which was rather strange, I must admit.

You see, it was about five days ago when the physical incarnation of death knocked at my door with a really, really big scythe in his hands. Uninvited, I should add. Absolutely, completely rude. When I stared him in the eyes, or an approximation of where his eyes should have been, I asked him, "Are you death?" He said yes, because he was Death. 

**"Hello, mortal..."** Death said in his very scary voice. **"I am death incarnate. I have come to you today for a very special reason..."** Death proceeded to tell me all about how inherently powerful the scythe in his hands was, the special powers of the scythe, and how power came with responsibility. That's what I assumed Death said anyway, I wasn't really listening because I had better things to be doing. 

To my credit, I caught the end of his speech about the scythe. **"... And that's why I am giving you this scythe."** Death went down on one knee and held the scythe out like a platter on a dining table. **"Take it, it will aid you on your adventures."**

I asked, "Why? What does it do?" because that is the way I am. I have no idea why Death was so fed up with me, but nonetheless, Death threw the scythe straight at my face and dissipated into nothingness.

Of course, I wouldn't actually use an enchanted scythe. It practically asked for the whole monkey's paw treatment. I threw it into the corner of my room and went back to whatever I was doing, and though I had no idea what that was, it was most definitely more important than mucking around with a magic Death Scythe.

The newly dubbed Death Scythe proceeded to prove how stupid I was about the basic workings of magical scythes, as it puffed into existence right on top of my head. It did this because that was the way scythes worked. At this point, I was getting somewhat peeved because of the metal object that had slammed straight down onto my head. I decided to do the reasonable thing: talk to the magical Death Scythe.

"What do you want from me?! What did Death even give you to me for?!" I yelled in a rather rude fashion. The Death Scythe, of course, didn't respond because it is only a regular scythe and cannot do magical things. How stupid of me, why did I even bother?

This is about the point where I gave up entirely attempting to communicate with my Death Scythe. There was only so much you could go through for a Death Scythe until you had to give up. Desiring some fresh air, I walked through the front door into my front lawn, where I saw normal people doing normal things such as flying through the air, fighting to the death and shooting magical crossbow bolts in random directions, because I lived in a world where that happened and was normal. Overall, it was a perfect day for a walk, and so I went, jogging down the road at a leisurely pace.

***Slam!*** The loud noise made me jump out of my skin, figuratively that is, because nothing that impractical would ever happen in this world. Speaking of which, the figure who had crashed into the ground in front of me in a meteor-like impact was standing and yelling at me, though I wasn't listening on account that I was hearing a really annoying ringing in my head. Eventually, my hearing found me again.

"... Kill you and take all your belongings and I can do it too! Don't test me, I have super strength and laser vision and..." I stopped listening. To be honest, I wished I could only hear ringing as I had moments ago. That would have been preferable to this. I believe it was around when the man in front of me gave up trying to talk with me and began trying to melt me into a puddle with lasers that the entire area around us darkened and a loud "Pop!" was heard.

I turned around. It was Death Scythe, here to save the day, as scythes do. As politely as I could, I asked Death Scythe, "Hey Death Scythe? Could you kill this trouble-maker for me? That would make me very grateful, thank you very much." Death Scythe didn't reply, as metal scythes didn't have mouths. What Death Scythe did do was cut the screaming man in front of me into bloody chunks upon the floor. It did this because I told it to and that is what scythes do.

I smiled as I realized my death would not be today, and I decided that maybe Death Scythe wasn't so bad. "Hey Death Scythe, that was a pretty cool thing you just did there!" I gave Death Scythe a little pat on the hilt. "Now, question here, is there anything else you could do besides making people die? Maybe, say, making floating numbers appear above everyone's head? I suppose it would have to indicate something, but for now, you could just put up random numbers that don't mean anything..." I continued rambling about this and that, finding Death Scythe to be a delightful listener during a conversation.

Of course, Death Scythe didn't reply, because that's what scythes did.
