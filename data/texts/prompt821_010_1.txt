The flock of demons were circling around the track laid out as the tracksuit from above watched.  His two assistants were keeping tabs on the time and the various metrics of the flock. Their movements were being recorded, every misjudged turn was another second, every swoop too early, too late was costing them points, and distracting them from their score.  There were various cages set with mannequins as target beings.  The flocks would approach with designated members to detach the cage from the chains, another set to pull it up and more groups dedicated to moving the cage.


The man watched with an ever growing expression of absoluteness.  A buzzing came from the assistant's pocket.  "Sir, it's the local governor."


He waved his hand, the assistant instructing the man he was busy.  Atop the mountains of Gui Lin, the green background and sharp cliffs made for perfect obstacles, the air thick with moisture would sharpen their senses and improve their endurance.  It was improvement over the last set of demons.


As the flock finished their run, the man rang the governor. "Good morning Sir.  No, the magistrate mentioned that we could use the skies today.  No, the magistrate had the allowance in writing. Thank you. Yes, I understand. Good bye."


Turning to the assistants, his sharp tongue scattered them as they ran quickly to go arrange for the next flock to depart for inspection.


The only thing that the trainer did not understand was the payment.  He was provided a stipend along with a set of apartments in the various cities where he would be exercising demons. Every six months though, he would receive a large shipment of Sycee, pure silver ingots used in old Chinese dynastic times.  It would also have a note in classic mandarin, signed from the Jade Emperor.


He shrugged and set to watch the next flock of demons.
