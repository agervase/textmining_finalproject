Everything was soon coming to an end.  My time in the fight clubs around town have turned me into a bitter, sullen person.  I've killed one too many people and it's all catching up to me. I tried to hide and cover it up, but the law always finds me.  I've been in here, in this room for three days now, waiting for them.  Covered in piss and shit, my hair greasy and my beard unkempt, I wait at my door, waiting and thinking, my fist at the ready. The longest I've ever held one was only a few minutes.  Three days could cause catastrophic damage.  The time it took for the SWAT team to arrive at my door and finally punch it down felt like an eternity, but I was determined.  I would go on.  I was going to escape.  My tight, intense focus made everything slower and slower, my senses heightened by the powerful charge.  I hear the hinge crack, light pouring in as the heavy door dents and caves in slightly.  I begin to release the punch as the door breaks free, timing it perfectly to volley the door back at the police.  It draws closer and closer, more and more light leaking into my disheveled room, the door now inches from my closed, scarred fist.  As soon as it makes contact, the force of the door floods up my arm, the sensation was like dropping from a 10 story building onto one hand, but I fought through.  Time seemed to speed up as I released my punch.  I hadn't noticed that the door had already bent completely around my fist, now a projectile headed straight for the cops.  The sheer speed of the door alone caused a sonic boom, shattering the windows and blowing everything around, my hair blown back as I stare the team down, the door launching right back at them.  They didn't stand a chance.  They were all blown through the opposing wall and far outside the apartment building.  I looked around to try and figure out an exit strategy.  I looked behind me and saw my open window.  I smiled and charged a kick in both my legs.
