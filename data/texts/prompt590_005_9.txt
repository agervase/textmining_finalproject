I, Norag the Great, and my trusty sidekick Peepo hack through the wilderness of the Antarctic winter and by chance find a hatch with a ladder. We descend and we find a group of odd looking humans who do not speak our language. Their carpet is red and banners are gold. They hand us a box that whirs for a moment and then says in English: 'Is the ice age over?'

Me: I don't understand, this box has technology that is far beyond ours, right?

Peepo: Yes, I'd say so. We don't have technology that can auto-detect someone's completely alien language and convert text.

Me: So if they had the technology for this, why didn't they invent technology to monitor the climate of the earth, or I don't know, to build technology to weather it.

Peepo: I don't know, Norag, some cultures value different things. See how lush and red their carpets are and how gold their banners are? It must have been some technological feat to keep them from fading after tens of thousands of years.

Me: I mean, the box they gave us... it is powered by something. Why wouldn't they use that power to heat their homes or power devices to monitor temperature.

Peepo: I don't know, maybe the warmth they got on working on this translator box as a passion project was enough. People are all different, Norag.

Me: How do we even respond to their question. The box doesn't have two way capability.

I nod at the weird looking humans. They stare blankly back at me.

Peepo: Nodding doesn't mean 'yes' in all cultures, Norag. Sometimes shaking your head means yes. Or any sort of gesture. Maybe in another 30,000 years, they'll invent a box that will let us talk back to them.

Me: You seem right, Peepo. Let us leave these weird humans.

Peepo and I climb out of the hatch and close it back up. We never spoke of this adventure again.
