"Come on start!" i shouted angrily, hitting my car's steering wheel. "Start goddamn it!" I cursed and swore upon curses and swears, hoping that somehow this dead car of mine would magically come to life, but ironically, this necromancer can't even start a god damn car. I really can't help but laugh at this fate.

I looked back and I saw blue and red flashing lights starting to appear over the horizons. I even started hearing police sirens going off. Really, who would have have thought that I'd be hoodwinked like this. Tried to use necromancy to help people, only to be betrayed in the end. Just because of what exactly?

Because I don't use the magic that is expected of someone good?

Because I use magic that villains usually use?

 Because my magic is evil? 

At the thought of evil, I couldn't help but laugh maniacally. Good and evil? Who's to say that I'm good or evil? God? The government? The people? Who!?

in the end, morality is but our own and those that force it upon others will always be the true oppressors!

I look back at the cops car, and they're but a minute away from me, at the most. I looked at the steering wheel, then I remembered that night. The night where my phone just came to life after casting a spell. I took hold of my steering wheel, and I was about to do something pretty stupid. I could possibly die here, but i guess that would be ironic for a necromancer, no?

I reached upon the inner crevices of my soul, and drew power from from. From the sins that I have committed, the pain that I have suffered, the loss that I have endured, and gravely chanted a spell in a language that no other mortal could possibly understand. A blinding light appeared from my eyes and chest. It was blinding, but also not. A good way to stun the cops for a while I guess. 

I hit the reverse, and to my surprise, the car actually did! The car was brought back to 'life' by me! I quickly drive away. It was a fairly easy run-away, the cops weren't exactly the best at keeping up with me, and necromancy also makes it a tad bit more easier.

After I loss them for a good few hours , I settle down in the woods for a bit. I need to process what I just did. Bring back something to 'life'. What's the limit!? Fortunately, we might just saw a a stump right in front of me. I did the same thing again with the car. Nothing happen for a second, then it begin to grow like it was 1987 and in a jiffy, it was the same height as all other trees that took millennia
