Nurse Rhodes was very well regarded at the hospital. She had been a loyal worker for over two decades, and she never missed a shift. Rhodes had worked in the Oncology ward since her first day, and she was known for being incredibly attentive to patients needs. 

&nbsp;

In fact, it was rumored she may have been too attentive. Patients under her rarely got better. It was something that might've been noticed in a larger hospital, but this was a small facility and it remained unnoticed. 

&nbsp;

I had been a regular here for as long as most could remember. I had no family to visit me, and my roommate spent most of his days sleeping, so I resorted to watching.

&nbsp;

I watched the doctors saunter emotionlessly from room to room during rounds. I watched families weep, watched them celebrate good news, and watched them leave. But most of all, I watched the nurses.

&nbsp;

When I first met Nurse Rhodes, I thought she was very unassuming. She had greying mousy brown hair and always had a stoic, expressionless face. She didn't say much, but she was always lingering in the halls or checking on patients like me.  

&nbsp;

Her eyes were cold and without feeling, but she didn't seem threatening until I saw her administering a syringe in my roommate's arm late while everyone else slept. She must've thought I was sleeping too, and I made sure to close my eyes before she turned around to leave.  

&nbsp;

The next morning he was wheeled to the morgue. Dead. 

&nbsp;

My next roommate was much livelier. He was a cheerful father of two rambunctious boys. He had been in remission, but he had been coughing and the doctors wanted to run tests over the next few days. 

&nbsp;

With each test, it seemed like he was going to be ok. 

&nbsp;

The night before he was to be released, I heard Nurse Rhodes quietly creep in while he slept. She was quiet, but I was a light sleeper and squinted my eyes open to see her administering a syringe in his arm. Once again, I made sure to close my eyes before she turned to leave, but this time she wasn't so quick to leave the room. 

&nbsp;

I felt the sting of a needle gently pressed into my arm. I had to stifle my shock and pretend to stir in my sleep. She removed the needle and silently glided out the room from whence she came. 

&nbsp;

The next morning when I awoke, I turned over to see my roommate gone. I asked a passing nurse what happened to him. 

&nbsp;

"He passed in the night poor dear, and those poor boys." 

&nbsp;

And so it continued. 

&nbsp;

It became almost routine then. Each day I would get a new roommate. Nurse Rhodes would pay us a visit each night, and every morning my new roommate would be dead. 

&nbsp;

She continued the new trend of stabbing me as well, but I always seemed to awake in the morning feeling the same as always. It was clear, however, that Nurse Rhodes was displeased at this. 

&nbsp;

She began upping my dose. At first, it was two needles a night, but soon she was pricking me with as many as four, five a night. Still, every morning I woke. The expressionless face of Nurse Rhodes was slowly taken over by a scowl. She hated me. She hated that I couldn't die. 

&nbsp;

Finally, I grew exasperated. It was enough. As amusing as it became, in a twisted way, I knew that this could not continue. 

&nbsp;

The next night when she came into my room I was alone. She strode over to my bed and was about to stick me when I grasped for her arm. She let out a squeak in shock and jumped back slightly, but I held tightly to her arm.

&nbsp;

"There's a special place in hell for people like you."

&nbsp;

I said it flatly. 

&nbsp;

The room suddenly burst into flames and I stood up from my bed. My feet were cloven hooves and horns grew out of my head. 

&nbsp;

"You-you're..." she stuttered nervously.

&nbsp;

"Yes. I am Satan, and you've been a naughty girl."

&nbsp;

No one ever saw Nurse Rhodes again. But I am pleased to inform you that she has adapted quite well to hell. 

&nbsp;

I've put her to work; my little angel of death.
