I blink at the open file. The fuck? Why is this my face?

I push my rolling chair to the other side of the room like a goth chick hacker in a cyberpunk movie. I pull down a green-chevroned scrapbook from a high shelf. CHILDHOOD, it says in my father's block script. There are hundreds of photos in here, from my infancy until I left home to join the force. All of them depicting the black-haired, green-eyed child from the case file. I'm not missing. My family knows where I am. *I* know where I am. I know *who* I am.

I reach for the desk phone. It's one of the last of its kind, on its way out when I was a kid and completely replaced by vidscreens nowadays. I like mine. I don't always want to see the people I talk to.

"Boss, there's something off about this new case. This kid, it's me."

"What? Oh, you weren't supposed to get that one. Give it to Carter."

"But why am I a missing person? I have birth records, a family, a memory of my entire life. I've never been gone."

"You're not supposed to know yet. You've done a lot of great work for us, and it's not time for that to be over."

"But-"

"Look, Cassidy, I don't want to hear it. Just drop the file in Carter's inbox and take the rest of the day off."

I pick up the file and look at it a little while longer while I make the trek to Carter's desk. He's on lunch, so I can't ask him about it. I take one last look at the child with my face, and slide the file into the tray, never to see it again.

I wrote this up just now in the comment box. I've liked this prompt, and if anyone likes it I may or may not continue it on Wattpad where I bear the appelation Coy the Inscrutable (@inscrutablecoy).
