"We should call him Micheal" I said to my wife, "We want him to have endless possibilities, and the Michael's are starting to dominate the STEM fields"

*I'm a Peter, which i'm reminded every day. Every advancement in Tech and Science is available immediately to the Michael's with the rest of us left behind.*
*It wouldn't be long until i couldn't keep up.*

"Or maybe a John, He would have the best Medical knowledge available."

She looked at me, my beautiful wife with tears in her eyes "We can't pigeon hole him Pete, he's not some machine to download into."

We looked at this perfect baby boy in our arms.

"Was there a name you had in mind?" I asked her.

Her smile told me our baby boy wasn't going to be the best engineer or doctor... 
But he might just be happy.

**18 YEARS LATER - THE LAST BASTION OF RESISTANCE**

The scholar sits with his hands rubbing his eyes. A patchwork of information about the God-King sprawled on the desk and pinned to the walls around him.

His rise to power, his godlike knowledge of what was, is and will be...

"I'm so close, it's staring me in the face" he says to the dust.

"Who's there?!"

**YOU KNOW WHO** the voice echoes in his mind

"I'm so close to finding your name, we can all be like you if you would just tell us your name!"

**IT IS BLASPHEMY TO ATTEMPT TO KNOW, YOU CONDEMN YOURSELF**

"So?! You already know that iv'e been searching for your name! You know everything! How!?"

**SAY THE LORDS PRAYER, FOR YOUR END COMES**

With shaking breath the scholar recites;

"Our father who's Art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name" he pauses...

"Art Hallowed?"

**I PREFER ARTHUR** is the last the scholar hears before the end.
