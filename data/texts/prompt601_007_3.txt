“Hey Jackass get back ere and give me my fahk in horse back”

John had just got back from a long day of lobster catching in Massachusetts bay, while it lasted it was a comfortable retreat

“Mother fahker, you get right the fahk back here”

“Yah I’m a mother fahker, I fahker your mother last night and she said I did better than her brotha!”

“You sonofabitch!”

The thieves were to far a way to hear him now, from there outfit and there mannerisms John could tell they were inexperienced, which made it all the more stinging that he was outplayed by them. John knew, John the wicked must rise again tonight.

John stared at the now lifeless corpse of his Boston terrier, and whispered silently to his ear: “you watch I’m gonna get those motha fahkers don’t you worry”

John parked his car at Harvard yard, he walked up to a small trash can by the road and clicked a button that hadn’t been pressed for 10 years. Before him opened up a passageway that went all the way under Sommerville, it was the perfect hideout, because seriously fuck Sommerville. Dodging his traps John sprinted across the tunnel into his base. Once inside he glanced at his map of Massachusetts. Worcester? Leominster? Where could they be.

“Wait”

Gloucester, it was perfect for keeping the feds of there tail, because there’s no fucking way anyone outside of mass would be able to pronounce it. Perfect.

He walked up to a glass tube, kicked over some left over Guinness from last years annual st. Patties day “riot in the street while dressed in green” as well as some witch burning supplies and peaked into the tube. Inside was an old rusted over knight armor, left to him by his great,great,great,great,great,great,great grandfather who John thinks was Irish but didn’t trust the dna companies to find out. 

Wicked John would ride again
