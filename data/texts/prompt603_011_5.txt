I was immediately suspicious. My best friend from childhood?

As every chick knows, the best we could muster in high school were frenemies. So I didn’t trust her before I was shoved into the room, and I certainly didn’t trust her now.

Plus, that outfit. Seriously, Supreme Miss Bitch-and-a-Half?

“I’d say it’s great to see you, but you’d know I’m lying,” Jenny said. 

“Why am I here?” I said.

“I know about your pissy little clique down in the Southwest. I know what they say about me. You all talk a big game, but you’ll never be popular enough to overthrow my regime,” she said.

OMFG. Are we still in fucking high school? 

“Why am I here?”

“If you don’t end this insurrection, I will kill you. All of you. In the most painful way,” Jenny said.

You don’t need to tell me that, sister. 

"Why. The fuck. Am. I. Here?” 

“You remember Steve, don’t you? What about Harry? And Tim? They’re all here. With me. Want to say hello?”

Holy shit. Ruthless. She was playing the cute-guys-who-never-gave-me-the-time-of-day card. Shit shit shit. I kept it together, but couldn’t rally a snappy comeback in time. We both knew in that instant I’d been beaten. 

I was tired. Fighting for truth and justice was hard, especially when the people you were fighting for were blissfully unaware that they needed help. Screaming fire in a crowded mall in the middle of a post-holiday sale only pisses people off. They want their new hemp linens and rustic coffee tables, organic sauvignon blanc and IPA, their cool cars and and endless Netflix. Fascism? Who the fuck cared as long as it worked for them.

I was tired. Who cared what was behind the curtain if life was good on this side? Who cared about other people's suffering? Who cared about principles? Whocaredwhocaredwhocared.

I was so tired.

“Steve’s here?” I said.
