*Somewhere in Europe, in an apartment, a tattooed punk knocks on the door. Three men in Islamic garb are inside*

"Hello comrades! Let's crush some yankees - bash the fash, right?"

"Do you not understand? We are a Salafi Jihad organization - we are not an anarchist commune."

"Hmm...that's not what the texts said."

"Texts?"

"Yeah, you left a flyer with a poster of Trump crossed out and a phone number. I'm the guy you've been messaging with to discuss our plans to 'hit' the American Embassy in Berlin."

"And by hit you mean...Could you please make sense? What number did you text?"

"+__ __________, comrade."

"Well then you've got the wrong number. Sorry."

"Wait one second...what is the likelihood that I call an anarchist cell and get a terrorist cell instead? Methinks you are spies."

*One of the other three men intrudes in the conversation*

Jihadist 2: Nigel, stop it. You're screwing up.

Jihadist 3: Nigel? *Who the fuck is NIGEL?* Wisam, this has to be some sort of a prank.

Jihadist 1: That was my kuffar name before I converted.

Jihadist 3: *Converted?* I thought you said you were Lebanese.

Jihadist 1: Lebanese - um - Catholic.

Jihadist 3: You mean Maronite? It shouldn't take you time to remember your upbringing.

*A door opens, and a woman in a niqab emerges*

Jihadist 4: Boys, what is this going on? If you don't shut up I'll...

*she grabs a bomb*

...hmm, this is too light. 

*points to Jihadist 3*

Jihadist 4: Why is this bomb so light? It's a dummy, right?

Jihadist 3: I never said we were going to actually kill anyone....

Jihadist 4: What...are you some kind of cop? (in an accusatory tone)

Jihadist 3 (perplexed): A...Aicha?

Jihadist 4: Driss? You remind me of a Sûreté nationale agent I went out with in Casablanca?

Jihadist 3: Yes...we were in the same class together!

*another knock at the door*

Punk: I guess you won't be wanting the bacon pizza I ordered for our collective....

*Punk slinks out, and sounds of argument can be heard while he pays for the pizza dejectedly using currency stamped with far-left symbols*

*Some time later, shots ring out as the British and Moroccan spies get into a fight and one of the Moroccans fires a warning shot into the ceiling*
