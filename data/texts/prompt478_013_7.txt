"I sat in my cubicle in the huge corporate office building, leaning back in an uncomfortable plastic chair. Of course, we didn't need comfortable chairs. It's not like any of us remembered sitting in them. I looked at my watch. Thirty seconds until the microchip activated and my shift began. I leaned back, and waited. And waited. And waited some more. 

After a full minute, I poked my head out of my cubicle. Everybody else was in a zombie like state, zoned out, seemingly hitting random keys at lightning speed on their keyboards. Great. My chip must have malfunctioned, and I would have to do a job I had no idea how to do while conscious.

I decided to investigate, and went into the cubicle next to my own. The employee was typing what seemed like layers upon layers of code. I went into the next cubicle, where the exact same thing was happening. I needed to find out how to do this, so I went back to my own cubicle to check out the program.

The coding program was already open on my computer. Must be done automatically. A text box popped up on the screen, which read: "You have been inactive for 10 minutes. Please click here if you would like a tutorial". I clicked the box, and a chunk of text came up. "Welcome to project rewrite. The aim of this project is to hack into the microchips of every human being on the planet, turning them into a slave race.". I didn't care about the following instructions. I got up and ran into the next cubicle, trying to shake the employee awake. I had to warn everybody. And that's when I blacked out".

The man in the suit finished reading aloud from my statement. He furrowed his brow. "So you believe the company is trying to turn humans into a slave race?" He asked. I nodded, and he laughed. "Don't worry. You won't become a slave. I mean, we have to dispose of all witnesses carefully."

His sadistic grin was the last thing i saw.
