At first, there was not much going on on this planet : some primitive forms of life hunting, reproducing, the usual. Then something happened, something that I will never forget, that I saw during my shift in the office הילף about 89 Megacycles ago : somewhere on this planet, a lightning struck some flammable life form, and it started a fire, nothing special, but then... then *this* hairy living saw it, got closer, and *grabbed this other fucking burning being with his bare hands, just out of curiosity.*

It all went downhill from there.

I remember that at the beginning I thought that it was "just" an incident, nothing to worry about, after all weird things happen all the time in this galaxy.

But still, it wasn't like anything else I ever saw : a living being put itself in danger for pretty much nothing, and it wasn't even an eusocial animal, like the ones in הרג'ע מיר. And then it happened again. And again. And then They found out that fire can warm you up, so they started to *actively* *look for* fire, and before long they *made it themselves*, and almost *worshiped* it.

At this point, I had told my everyone at the office about them, and these things were basically the biggest thing right now, everyone was talking about them, tho I'm not sure if they were afraid or amused by this tiny things, but I know for sure that *i* was *terrified*.

One may think there is nothing that scary in them : They only live for a really short amount of time, barely one quarter of a cycle. But They all seem to try to make that lifespan *even shorter* : "One of us discovered that breaking rocks makes them keener ? Great, now we can attack these *giant fucking mountains of muscles that are ten times bigger than us !* Or even better : let's chase them until they're all dead ! Wait, the stuff that allow us to make fire can *float* ? Well good, now we can use it to travel on water for hundred of miles with no way to control where we are going, just in case we discover a new place, just a little bit better, if we don't die during the journey of course !"... I think you got the idea.

The thing with them is that They seem to have no consciousness as a species whatsoever : the fact hundreds of them died because of lighting did not stop them to literally use lightning to light them up.

And that's why they are labeled "THE MOST DANGEROUS LIFE FORM IN THE UNIVERSE" by most unibloids, and that's why the Council voted to put their planet's System in isolation for an undetermined amount of time. Well, to be precise, the Council voted this when they discovered that most of Them used big metal box propelled by explosions of decomposed dead things to move around.

But I don't think it's a good solution; I'm probably the thing in the Universe that knows the most about Them, and I know that, no matter what we do against them, They will find a way to use it a their advantage. In fact, some religious terrorists tried to destroy the planet by sending a gigantic asteroid on it, to purge the Galaxy, and not only did They succeeded to diverge the path of the asteroid, but They used the minerals on the meteoroid to builds rockets - their medium to reach space, essentially their big box propelled by dead stuff but way bigger, and aimed at the sky. Who knows, maybe they will find a way to use the cosmic fabric we use to isolate them to manipulate the space time continuum ? I'm pretty sure they could achieve that by doing random shit with it until it happened, and that probably wouldn't even be their biggest achievement.

I think the only solution we have is to engage with them, to try to defuse the ticking bomb that they are by easing them in the cosmic community, and then maybe they could somehow calm down.

That's my second WP and as you can probably tell I didn't knew how to end the thing. Hope you liked it anyway, and I'm sorry for any mistakes I may have done, English isn't my first language :/
