Cold. Very cold. The only thought I'd had in what could've been hours. Could've been months. That fucking pig shot Ronnie and now there's nobody left who's willing to sell me some product. The old discarded New York Times was the only thing between my ass and the pavement. All this and those words which should've been buried deep in my subconscious were the sole inhabitants of the vast cavern of my head. Very cold. For reasons one would fail to comprehend, I was pulled out of my painful withdrawal. Every fiber of my being was focused on some middle aged guy across the street. I combed the files upon files that had suddenly flooded my brain. I had forgotten what it was like to be able to focus. The only thing of note was that he was walking toward the old apartment I had my first hooker in. And the milk. It was pissing me off. I didn't know why. After a few minutes of heightened awareness I felt myself sinking. The library that briefly resided in my mind burned. I felt at home in the husk. Very cold. After spending what was a second, what was a minute, what was a year, what was a lifetime in my comfortable haze, I was ripped back out. The library grew back like a field in spring. I could feel once more. What was it this time? I heard a gunshot and a scream... was that it? I had to have heard someone wander into the arms of uncle colt at least twice this morning. I didn't understand why I was ripped from my cozy home until I saw a white fluid dripping from a window on the third floor. Just as soon as I was brought out of the comfort of my two words, I was thrust into the most excruciating pain of my life. I writhed on the base of my asphalt coffin. I didn't know why. It was a million years of pain, then silence. After a moment, everything got cold. Very cold.
