*No one could predict what was going to happen next.......least of all ..The Neoronancers.......*

Standing on the front end of the head ship, Larsen James Reostar stared out to into the black abyss, he was so used to this sight after traveling for Eons and Eons during space in search of another home for his race, after their home planet was destroyed during the great Tragedy. He gleamed with excitement as he he saw a tiny blueish dot flicker in the distance. Curious, Larsent James set course towards this blueish dot, eager to learn more.

Larsent James Reostar was the first sentient to discover a magnificent,  eye beholding planet . He knew not what awaits him, but he had to see what was the cause of creating such a marvel to behold from galaxies away. The captain needed to know about this great discovery.

He named it E-AR-TH(pronounced EEH----RRRRR-----PPPHHHHH) after his mother, who was a Goddess of measurable strength and you dared not forsake your duties in her presence, for you will be punified in her great glory.

After dubbing this exquisite planet, Larsent James proceed up to the Captain's Quarters to acquire space boarding clearance and to request clearance to set foot on this delightful planet.

"HAIL! Captain NAHT RA TARA! I come with joyous news! We have located a new planet! It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It reminds me of me mother! Oh what a joyous moment. I request permission my leech to board the Landen Pod to investigate this planet. I must know what secrets this planet holds and what could be the cause of such beauty. May I be pardon from my duties as Ship Overseer?" Larsen James asked in their native language

"HAIL! If there is a chance to mine some more minerals for our fleet. Then you must go. But consult with the Neormancers first. We must be prepared for anything. We cannot afford to grow accustomed to our surroundings....not after The Great Tragedy. Be OFF!" replied Captain NAHT RA TARA

"MY kindest gratitude my leach. I will go see the Neormancers at once." Larsent replied with an excitement that could not be contained.

"AI! Be off!  My the Goddess of Live be with you! "

Larsent James dismissed himself immediately and went to the Neoronancers, they were the prime Advisory Council for The Empire, since the universe was utterly massive, they relied on the Neoronancers to aid them into the unknown, for one did not dare set foot into the unknown without consulting the Counsel of Neoromancers.

*Approaching the Council Hall, Larsent James always seemed to be amazed that their ship could travel at lighting speeds with such an enormous structure in their hold, from bottom to top the doors with almost 6 feet long, engraved with The Mark of the Empire, a lighting blueish Spear striking through 5 planets of variant sizes. The doors were coated with a granite like substance to make it almost impenetrable to any outside forces. Standing in front of the huge doors with six gaurds, each gaurd looked  almost the same with there four-armed muscular bodies and tentacles protruding from their square jaws. Each soldier carried a shield on both sides of their bodies in their upper arms, which was engraved The Mark of The Empire. On the left bottom arm was a bracelet with a mounted fire arm, this was called the Berat'th(also knows as Death Bringer) it was like a small pistol, but it fired scolding hot blue orbs that could obliterate any life form in mere seconds. In the bottom right hand the soldiers all hold a staff shaped object, it looked like it was meant to be a spear, but it had protruding spikes from top to bottom and on both ends were serrated edges that form the shape of a spear head, these edges as well as the spikes were always dipped in Bera'tha(Death Juice). If you were ever unlucky enough to get pricked by this you would die within an hour suffering excruciating pain. This potion is often favored by Larsent James Reostar's Race, since it could be easily made from their spit.*

"HALT! Show us the MARK! OR YE WILL PERISH!" The guards all exclaimed in unison, readying their weapons. They refused to take any chances.

*With a grow, Larsent James extended his 4 arms, each pointing in a different dirrection, and with a big GROWL a light emitted from Larsent Reostar's chest, revealing the mark burned into his skin at birth with an ancient tradition.

*Satisfied, the guards open up a passage way for Reostar.

Upon entering the Vast Chamber, Reostar noticed that the walls have been line with the same material as the doors, and at center was the Advisory Council of Neoronancers, all sitting in chairs too high for them, look so ever wise, but Reostar knew the were only bored and wishing for a way out, ever since The Great Tragedy it was forbidden for The Advisory Council to leave this room.


"HAIL! I want to go visit E-AR-TH for it has shown me a delightful scene that reminds me of me mother. I must know what can cause such immense beauty." Larsent James greeted the Counsil who seemed oblivious to the fact that he was standing right there, under their noses


*The Council carefully observed this strange planet to see what could be learned, and to there disappointment it seems that there methods could not penetrate an invisible shield membrane around the planet that seem to contain high volumes of Oxygen and Nitrogen which was a very. very deadly mixture. One whiff of this potion could wipe out an entire galaxy.*

"Larsen James Reostart, this planet seems inhabitable, due to an invisible membrane that is filled with the with the same ingredients as our spit.. Do you still wish to proceed. You will DIE! HORRIBLY and SLOWLY!"

"Ai, even if I can only gather a glimpse of the creator of this beauty, I shall be forever grateful, and then spend eternity with me mumzer." replied Reostar, eager to see if this planet will hold up to it's namesake.

"Ai. So be it. You, Larsen James Reostar, Son of Goddess Reostar, Godess of Hearts and Souls, are granted SEQUANTERRA! BE OFF!"


*SEQUANTERRA! is the highest permission given to any individual, this grants the wearer of this title a mind link the the Advisory Council. It is crucial that the wearer of this rank must protect his own life, for if the wearer of this title were to be slain, The Council will die too.*
* * *

With a thunderous bang, Larsent James Reostar's pod landed in the middle of nowhere. He immediately leaped out and run as far as he could....as the pod he was traveling in had set ablaze high up in the sky and Reostar was trembling from fear of dying, he could be responsible for wiping out the Entire Council. The pod was cracking....loudly....and it never does that. In the 1 Million Years that his clan lived he had never heard of a pod that could burn


*What manner of sorcery is this?" 


***BANG!***

"MY POD! MY POD! How am I going home!?"

Larsent James was now stuck on this forsaken planet, he knew not what to do now, but walk. Since no one back home seemed to be as eager as him to go to this planet. Everyone just urge Reostar to go and explore.

Reostar decided to head north to see if he could at least find some shelter, since he did not want dangerous elements could await him during his stay. While walking, James decided to observe his surroundings, to his left was nothing but red granules that were soft to the touch and was quite delicious to James, it tasted like his mother's home cooking, oh how he was reminded of home. To his right, Reostar saw more red granules and small lumps in between....these looked like yendeerings( he was in fact staring at a cactus). James grabbed a yendeering and proceed to exceed some excrement from his left arm, afterwards he Ferociously scratched his left arm from where the excrement came and inserted the yendeering up his tofhoora(buthole to humans, mouth to his race)

After he was done with his deed he looked up the sky, it was like nothing he had seen before. Blue was the primary color here with white puffs and squiggles here and there. He had never seen a sky this bright. He chuckled, for the sky was the same color as him when he was born. Odd....

Finally after what felt lik eons of walk he arrived at a peculiar building with windows and a door.....his race lived in eggs until the age of 17 where they were then transferred to pods, never had he seen such a peculiar building

*Reostar was staring a trailer home*

Without warning a ferocious animal leaped out from behind a tiny gate and growled at James then turned it's back on him. Shaked it's behind and went into a smaller door in the peculiar building...


*After consulting with The Counsil through the mind link, James learned that he was attacked by a simple house cat*

"They habor disease riddled filth as pets?" How peculiar.....

James went to knock on the door, when it opened a burly man appeared with his stomach hanging out, protruding like a sore thumb and showing chest hair the size of a small carpet.


*James had to control with all of his being not to vomit at this puny baby showing it's birth membrane to world.....*

***"How disgusting!"***
