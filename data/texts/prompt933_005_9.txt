When ReTouch went online, I knew our lives would change forever. I thought, as we all did, that life would be better- that we had finally found the solution. 

I believe now that our naivety sprang from our desperation.

It made sense from all sides, and it’s no wonder that installation received nearly unanimous support- over 94 percent of the cloud-vote worldwide. 

It was too late to pretend that the world would have any chance of stepping back from the precipice without something that changed all of us at once. And so ReTouch was born, a worldwide satellite network relaying a sensory matrix down to each and every one of us- to our birthChips- so that we would all see the same thing. And we do. We see a world of homogeneity, one of beauty, one with flaws- yes, but one where teamwork and acceptance of each other as brothers and sisters in the struggle empowers us to fix the world that is just beyond our eyes. 

With no perception of the other to divide us, we quickly formed a oneworld community, our borders started to melt away and we started to work together on millions of projects, big and small. ReTouch worked so well it ended civil wars that had been raging for decades, it created a gentle aversion to killing that dropped homicides by 93% within the first week of launch. And it made even the people we found most ugly transform into people we could easily love and support. 

ReTouch was specifically designed to act on quorum sensing so that anything we saw collectively we knew we were building together through our will. 
 
We believed in ReTouch, and it saved our lives and our planet. But even in this paradise, there are people who want more control than that afforded them by the natural boundaries of the freedom give to us as birthright- there are people whose will is stronger than we could have every possibly imagined.

I ran out of steam. Maybe I’ll come back to try and wrap this up later! Thanks for reading.
