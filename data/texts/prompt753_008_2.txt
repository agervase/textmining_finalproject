When I was younger, I just thought I had acid reflux, and so did my mother. She figured it out when she told me the tooth fairy was going to come and take my tooth, and then again when the Santa incident happened. She told me not to tell anyone. And here's where it got even worse.

I was standing in front of the entire student body. My teacher had picked me to do a solo for the Veteran's Day program. Me, the eighteen year old that no one really payed attention to, the quiet kid, to do a solo. I felt sick at my stomach. I opened my mouth to sing, but all I could do was shake. I looked around, everyone I knew and more were staring at me. I felt something rising in my throat, but before I could do anything about it, the entire student body were laughing at the puddle I just made all over the floor.

Destiny, my friend, comforted me in the bathroom. I cried on her shoulder after I wiped my face off. "Of course it's me that barfs in front of everyone!" I sobbed. She stroked my hair and spoke softly. "It's okay Sofie... You're only human.." She said. I felt something nasty again, but this time, on my tongue. I realized quickly what was going on. I wasn't human? I felt sick at my stomach again, but this time it wasn't just butterflies. If i'm not human... What am I?

"My child... It is okay. You've figured it out, you've passed the test!" A booming voice said. Suddenly, I wasn't in the women's restroom anymore. I was in a structure that looked like things you'd see in a textbook about greek history. I stumbled backwards. "Wh\- Who are you? Where am I?" I stuttered. A large figure walked towards me, and stood over me. "I, am Poseidon, King of the seas!" His voice nearly shook the room. I stumbled back to my feet. "P\- Poseidon? But you're a god! D\- Does that make me one too?" My voice was shaking. "Hush now, my child. We have much to discuss."
