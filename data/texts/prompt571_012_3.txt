"The bitch! How could she do this to me?" John thought as he stared into Katherine's eyes trying to mask his emotions. "Please Julia! Forgive me!"

"Forgive you?" Kathrine yelled "How can I forgive you, John?"

John could't believe how unaffected Katherine looked by the whole thing. Maybe she never had any real feelings for him. How else could she be pulling this off?

"She means nothing to me. You are the woman I love, Julia. She was in a fragile place. I offered to help her and next thing I knew she was kissing me."

"She was kissing you?" Katherine put on a look of scorn. "You always were pathetic. How could have been so blind?"

Blind, that was exactly how John felt. "Julia, I promise I will never do it again." John could feel his voice fail him, having to say those words to her.

"I am leaving you and I am taking the kids with me. Goodbye, John."

Katherine turned and stormed off with John following her. 

"No! Julia, wait!" he yelled. She didn't stop. She kept on going past the curtains until she could find some privacy for the both of them.

John soon caught up and grabbed her shoulders turning her towards him. "This must be giving you a kick, huh?" he said in a low voice. As low as his rage would allow.

"John, please, I know it sounds bad, but I can explain" Katherine pleaded, her face overwhelmed by the emotions she had to hide just moments before.

"How long has this been going on?" John asked.

"Two weeks, but nothing has happened between us."

"Nothing happened? I read the messages. You meet your ex-boyfriend for dinner and lie to me about it and you say nothing happened?"

"I am sorry I hurt you, but I was going to end it. I promise!" said Katherine. 

"Save it, Katherine. You and I are through! And after we go back on that stage and finish this play, I never want to see you again."
