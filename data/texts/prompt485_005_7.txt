Since the fortnight of the royal feast

a celebration of the gods and past glory,

the sun refused ignite

not a peep of light

Which brought fear and furore.

&#x200B;

Many men blamed the gods.

Others accused "the monster" for the lack of light and rain.

One said, "We're being punished. This is a sign!"

Another, "This is indeed the end of times!"

As they mourned by melted wax in vain.

&#x200B;

Their tummies cried with growls

Children's hair grew grey and limp.

Their bodies bent and slope.

"Lord King, we are at the end of our rope!

We can no longer scratch and skimp."

&#x200B;

The Queen grew weak with pains of hunger.

Her thrown was in weighted shame.

She shakily pointed to the copse.

"Nine months of drought and rotten slop,

and we all know who's to blame."

&#x200B;

Steeped in the woods was a tiny hut

inside someone time forgotten

not to be outdone,

he stole the sun

and hid it deep within his pocket.

&#x200B;

The crowd agreed with the notion

and too, the ailing king.

So, they lit up his torch

and he saddle his horse,

armed and en route to to the mysterious being.

&#x200B;

When he arrived to his stoop he yelled trough his horn,

"What have you done?! And do tell no tales!"

The man exhaled with angst and stood to his feet.

"Lord King, Lord King, is this how you greet?"

Smiling, while swigging his last cup of ale.

&#x200B;

"You are a bastard of the gods, so they are cursing us.

Half-lings like you are like huts with spare covering,

Only seen as a bother.

A twisted reminder to your father's.

If we are rid of you, this will end our suffering. "

&#x200B;

The man looked him up and down

then let out a hearty shrill.

"You give the gods too much

many hard lessons of life and such,

are the residue of freewill.

&#x200B;

Yes, I did it. Exactly what you imply.

But you see Lord King, I had a goal.

I simply wanted to teach you a lesson.

As everyday I am treated as a peasant

for something I cannot control.

&#x200B;

You show up to my door wizened and feeble

but your mind quick with power.

This is how it feels to me,

My body a tall tree,

but my mind - roots withered and scoured.

&#x200B;

I will return the sun to its rightful place

but only if you agree to this dictation.

Promise that you will treat all women & men

the way you would like them to treat your kin,

from now until the ends of creation."

&#x200B;

The king looked to the man with a sorrowful stare.

And said, "My friend, it is so, hereby."

Then the men shook hands

and together danced

as he lifted the sun to the sky.
