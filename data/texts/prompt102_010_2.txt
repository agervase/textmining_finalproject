The hand was unexpected: I'd been typing alone in my room all evening, seeing that ever-elusive viral submission. I froze, but the voice cut the air with an edge that could cut steel.

> "Mr. Johnson. We need to discuss you including my name in every submission lately."

A burden left my shoulder, and I felt compelled to turn to see. Momentarily, I tried to resist, but my chair peeled away from my desk and spun to position me eye-to-eye with the Devil himself. 

It was a strange thing, he was quite the charming man in a fitted tuxedo and carrying a briefcase. Save the skin and horns, he seemed like he was taken straight from wall street. He glanced over me with a scrutinous gaze.

> "I understand I have arrived unexpected, but you know I prefer you work in more appropriate attire." 

Oh right, I still hadn't gotten dressed today. It was only what, 4pm? 

> "Yeah, sorry."
> 
> "It changes nothing. My SEO team and comptroller have come to a very difficult conclusion: your role is obsolete. Originally, we found the grassroots articles very receptive to the online audience and generating interest in the Fallen Church. It was quite an impressive investment from an advertising perspective. Yet, your numbers have been falling lower and lower, and your post quality has been in significant decline. There have even been personnel issues and formal complaints regarding your business ethics: you have not even bothered to dress yourself."
> 
> "Wait, are you firing me?"
> 
> "It has been a difficult decision for some more than others, but this revenue no longer compares to the returns we are seeing with newer clickbait ads and social media reach. I never expected so many mortals to willingly sign up for an eternity of suffering just to share depictions of cats. The Terms of Service writers have really done some ground-breaking work. Your returns have been declining for months, and you have resisted any attempt to be trained in other fields. You are solely at fault in making yourself a less valuable asset to the organization. It does truly pain me to release your contract, but you need to look at the big picture here: this is a company with a bottom line, nothing personal."

> "It was Jessica in the legal team that pushed for this, isn't it? Ever since I stuck her with training the interns she's been out to get me."
> 
> "Do you understand the impact of what I just told you? Your contract has been forfeit. You are free to leave the domain, even try to redeem yourself."
> 
> "Can I still send a complaint to HR if I'm being terminated?"

The Devil signed, handed me a sheet of paper about severence packages, and vanished.
