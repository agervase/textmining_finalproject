**Item #:** SCP-KN1F3

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-KN1F3 is to be kept in a standard safe-class item locker. When held, SCP-KN1F3 is to be kept no fewer than 20 meters distant from any geographical representation of any region, real or fictional, outside of testing.

**Item description:** SCP-KN1F3 is a Roman pugio. Carbon dating places the origin of this knife in the 2nd century CE. The tip of SCP-KN1F3 to 5mm below the tip shows much more excessive wear than the rest of the blade. Apart from this, and its antiquity, the appearance of SCP-KN1F3 is unremarkable. 

When SCP-KN1F3 is held by a human, they are compelled to stab any and all maps in their immediate vicinity with SCP-KN1F3. This includes maps printed on standard paper media, globes, electronic maps, and any artwork portraying maps. If an item is currently being discussed with relation to the nearest map, the holder of SCP-KN1F3 will wait until an oppertunity can arise to use SCP-KN1F3 which will arouse the least suspicion. During the conversation, however, the subject will not leave the immediate vicinity of the map of their own accord. The subject can still be removed from the map, using standard non-anomalous, non-compliant human methodologies. 

SCP-KN1F3 was discovered at the Museum of the Roman Civilization in Rome, Italy. After a curator grabbed SCP-KN1F3 to provide a demonstration of proper pugio technique. This curator then proceeded to stab all maps on display in the museum, only stopping when security arrived and detained him. The curator was arrested, and SCP-KN1F3 was confiscated as evidence. When the confiscating officer began to continue defacing maps, embedded agents were able to contain SCP-KN1F3 using a standard "grabber tool". 

Testing has shown that the intention of the map, not the content, is the key to SCP-KN1F3's traits. SCP-KN1F3 works equally well on a children's drawing of their neighborhood, and a [REDACTED] brand world atlas. These properties do extend to electronic mediums, with SCP-KN1F3 testing inadvertently destroying 4 phones and 7 laptops to date. This is also the case of tattoos, as Dr. Bright's host during a test of SCP-KN1F3 had a tattoo cryptically showing a map of a stash of drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. It is unknown if Dr. Bright was aware of this map.
