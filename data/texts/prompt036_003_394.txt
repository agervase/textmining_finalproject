Odin leaned forward in his gilded throne, his single eye judging the young man who stood before him.

"What do you make of this, mortal?" Odin asked looking to his left and right, down the line of gods.  

Thor scoffed, "This pathetic creature is no warrior! Look at his frail limbs and tiny body. How many frost giants have you slain?"

"Uh, none," the young man stammered out. 

"How many of your foes have you deceived in order to turn the tide of war?" Loki asked behind steepled fingers.

"I don't really like lying," the young man answered.

"And what of that weapon in your hand? How many lives has that taken? How many trophies have you carved from the bodies of the fallen?"

"Well it doesn't really do any of that."  

"Does it have any mystical properties? Perhaps it returns when you throw it?" Thor asked caressing his hammer.

The young man shook his head no.

"Then why are you here? What can you possibly do to earn your place here among the greatest heroes of all time?"

The young man thought for a moment and hefted the metal spatula.  

"It does have a power. Something that very few things can possess," he paused and met the eyes of the gods sitting in front of him.

"It has the power to slay hunger!" he roared and thrust the spatula into the air.

Odin slammed his hands down on the table, thunder tore through the chamber shaking the young man violently.  A small smile spread across his lips and his chest began to heave.  Laughter bubbled up from inside of Odin and he found himself gripping his sides trying to contain his laughter.  He wiped away a lone tear that streaked down his wrinkled cheek.  

"Ah, my boy. It has been too long since I have laughed like that. It brings me great pleasure," he paused stifling another bout of laughter, "To banish you to Hel."

The floor beneath the young man's feet vanished sending him plummeting through darkness to Hel waiting below.
