_"YOU."_  
The apparition's voice shook the walls of my loft.  
The air chilled and the lights dimmed as it glided into my living room from the entryway.  
Clearly, it was upset.

_"WHAT ARE YOU,"_ it demanded.

I couldn't help but smirk. That seemed to infuriate it all the more.

_"YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME. YOU CHANGE YOUR FACE."_

It wasn't wrong.  
"I want to say... Carl?" I asked it.

_"CARLOS EVENGL--"_  
"_Carlos_, that's the one. Of course." I took a moment to recall the century in which I had first met him.  
I remembered. "Oh, goodness. You must be pissed. Finally tracked me down, have you? Well done."

_"FACE YOUR RECKONING,"_ it bellowed, stirring the air around it into a whirlwind. Blood began to seep from the walls. And I had just gotten new wallpaper not 2 months ago. Shame, that.

"That's all you've got? You're a slow learner, Carlos."  
The need to shout over the howling gale somewhat diminished my authority, so I infused some vitae to magnify my voice a bit. It felt a little undignified to join a screaming match with so young a ghost, so I tried to keep it brief.  
"I have _hundreds_ of you. And at your best, you are a nuisance."

_"WE CANNOT DIE UNTIL--"_  
"Until _I_ die, I know, I know. Not my problem, Carlos."  
I thought I was being perfectly reasonable.

_"MONSTER."_  
"So, listen, stay here as long as you like, because I sure as hell won't be coming back, now that you've found it."  
_"YOU ARE A MONSTER."_  
I grabbed my coat and hat off the coat rack as I looked around for a sufficiently dark shadow nearby. Thankfully, Carlos' atmospheric effects made that fairly easy.  
"Take care, Carlos. See you in another few hundred years, eh?" I tipped my hat to him. "And do pardon the mess I'm about to make."

...which was actually my old dramatic exit line, but in the heat of the moment I had forgotten the latest I had come up with.  
Worse still, as I was boiling into the coffee table's shadow in a puddle of blood and ectoplasm, en route to the shadow behind the fridge of my penthouse in New York, he managed to spoil the _theater_ of that moment with some unintelligible shouting about finding me again.

Such a boor, that Carlos.
