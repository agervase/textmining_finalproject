Chairman: "All right, the High Council is called to order. Is there any old business to discuss?"  
First delegate: "All of the world governments are either wiped out, or holed up in underground bunkers. We can dispense with the remainders according to the established schedule."  
Chairman: "How's the nuclear cleanup going?"  
Third delegate: "It will take a while, but fortunately, only three world leaders had the stones to launch, so most of the missiles were taken out by our counter measures."  
Chairman: "Very good. Any new business?"  
Fifth delegate: "Well, sir, we did come across a new group that may need attention..."  
Chairman: "Oh?"  
Fifth delegate: "Yes sir, it seems they stumbled onto our secure communications network..."  
Chairman: "Shit! Again?! This isn't going to be another 4chan, is it?"  
Fifth delegate: "I don't think so, sir. The 4chan were clearly trying to disrupt our communications, and as you know, wreaked havoc on our plans for several weeks."  
Chairman: "What's different this time?"  
Fifth delegate: "This intrusion seems to be entirely accidental. The human appeared to be attempting to request delivery of a large quantity of low-nutritional-value snack food."  
Chairman: "You said it was a group?"  
Second delegate: "Yes sir, a fairly large one."  
Chairman: "How is it that they have escaped our notice for so long?"  
Fifth delegate: "Well, um. They don't seem to go outside much. Sir."  
Chairman: "They don't go outside much? We've been here for months! Who the hell are these humans?"  
Second delegate: "They seem to be a very loose coalition organized around a communications channel called "Reddit".  
Chairman: "The small furry creature whose feet provide good fortune?"  
Third delegate: "No sir, that's a rabbit. I believe these are named after the diminutive, fictional creatures with hairy feet from popular entertainment."   
Second delegate: "That's a hobbit. This is something else. They seem to be made up of a bizarre spectrum of political, religious, social, and, er, anti-social ideologies. The main commonality seems to be a supreme confidence in their own individual opinions."  
Chairman: "Okay, so how do we defeat them? Targeted strikes?"  
Fifth delegate: "Impractical, sir. They are too geographically dispersed."  
Chairman: "Can we lure them out for a head to head fight?"  
Second delegate: "Unlikely, sir. Most don't even seem to know or believe that we're here."  
Chairman: "How is that possible?"  
Fifth delegate: "Like I said, sir, they don't go outside much. The good news is that the group used to be much larger. Significant numbers of them apparently were ordinary people who were wiped out in the first several attack waves."  
Chairman: "Good. But how do we root out the rest of them?"  
Fifth delegate: "It might be best to just wait them out, sir."  
Chairman: "That will take too long. With the distributed, autonomous power and food production systems the humans have developed in the last decade or so, it could take years. Some could hold out indefinitely."  
Third delegate (quietly): "Not if we take away their will to live."  
Chairman: "And how do we do that?"  
Third delegate (more firmly): "Turn off the porn."  
Several delegates at once: "No." "Too far!" "Seems extreme." (Softly, from the back of the room) "Wasn't that what we conquered this planet for?"  
Chairman: "All, right! All right. Settle down. We will table this matter for future discussion until the Second and Fifth delegates have studied it further and devised a plan. At this stage of the conflict, we should not need to meet as often. See you in six months."

And so it went with the Earth's new High Council meetings. The Second and Fifth delegates to the High Council at first provided detailed reports on the resistance group known as "Redditors", but failed to devise an effective and efficient means of eliminating them. As time wore on, both the reports and proposed plans became more vacuous, until the line item on the agenda became simply a pro forma point in the ever-less-frequent meetings to pause for a delegate to say "Nothing new to report."

*****

And yet, some Redditors, *did* begin to venture outside, and once again engaged in meetups (though more secretive than they once were). They formed small communities, and carried on the species known as humans. At times, proposals were made to engage the alien invaders who had taken over the planet. But having concluded the prescribed stages of the invasion, the aliens had shut down most of their largely automated military apparatus. And their relatively small enclaves were few and far between. So the Redditor strike forces sent out to fight the aliens repeated failed to actually find any. Eventually they stopped looking and the most heated conflicts once again took place between subreddits: those favoring aggressive action against the invaders, those who favored peaceful coexistence with them, and those who categorically denied their existence.

One day, perhaps, the two species will take notice of each other once again. Whether those descendants will still desire to fight each other remains to be seen. But for now, a quiet peace reigns*.
