For 60 years, we've been on patrol. For 60 years, we've been lost to the surface. Lost to the sun, to life, but never in purpose, never in memory. We began our service as a ship of war, and now we continue our service as a ship of salvation, of rescue.

Every Navy man knows that he may never return home, that he may be lost at sea. We submariners know this better than most, but we sailed off below the waves out of duty. On that fateful day when we left the world of the living some 60 years ago, we became a part of a different Navy. While no longer a ship of war, we're still a Navy ship, as Comm. Latta always reminds us. While the regs have loosened, when XO Lt. Mendenhall rings the bell, we all man our stations for we serve a greater purpose now: to guide those at sea when all hope is lost and to the guide those who become lost below the waves.

For 60 years, we manned our route. For 60 years of darkness and silence, we watched from below. When the wind and waves above howl and crash, we stand guard. When ships are tossed and fear grips those within, we stand guard below. Ever present, ever silent, ever watchful. And when the wind becomes silent and the waves grant mercy, we glide away into the dark to continue our patrol. As those above thank the heavens for salvation, we below will never be known for our duty.

Until one day, as the skipper barks out "Full fathom five and toll the bell" to start our patrol once more, we are found. Though our spirit roams, our original resting place remains in place. Our tomb, our silent and sacred tether to the world. What was once lost has now been found. And so our patrol now comes to an end and we are granted relief. And a silent promise has now been fulfilled. We, the USS Largarto, will now be laid to rest and we, her crew, shall be granted reprieve. We return to our families and loved ones to see them once more after our long patrol. And one final time, the bell rang out across the sea as our ship finally came home to port.

On June 2006, the US Navy found one of her lost submarines. The USS Lagarto was found in the Gulf of Thailand by a private expedition and later confirmed by the US Navy after their investigation. Though they remain below the waves in their final resting place, may their spirit return from patrol. May the lost be found and be laid to rest. Just as those below remain on patrol, we above must remain on patrol. Ever searching, ever present, never forgetting.
