What is the most important rule of being a wish lawyer?

If you guessed "everyone deserves access to a lawyer", well, that's true for regular law.  It's a given that everyone deserves legal representation, but for us there's one higher rule, one thing more important than anything else:

**Keep The Bounds Intact**

The ultimate goal of all supernatural entities is the destruction of the fragile barrier between this world and the Others, known as the Bounds.  Whether intentionally - as is the case with demons, devils, spirits, etc - or out of indifference as in the case of the Djinn, every use of supernatural powers weakens the Bounds.

When you are retained by a client, whether your client is an ordinary human non-mage or an Other, your first priority is not to that client.  It is to the Bounds.  Remember that.  Mundane codes of ethics are for mundane laws:  We, in the here and now, are all that stands between our world and the unthinkable.

It is, in this case, literally unthinkable - we cannot comprehend the nature of the Other.  Those so exposed to the truth have returned insane or worse.  If that befalls our world, our ever-shrinking oasis of Rationality, it is the end of everything we know and everything we can know.

**If your client is a non-mage human**

First, do everything in your power to lower your client's expectations.  Tales of Monkey's-Paw style perversion of wishes are commonplace, so be certain to have plenty of case studies to back up those tales.  Ideally, the client would be dissuaded from making *any* use of Outside power, but this is often impossible.  The key, then, is to limit the scope of the wish.

Many clients wish for immortality, for example.  Obviously, stopping the mechanisms of entropy as we know them would severely weaken the Bounds, so this cannot be allowed.  Long life is permissable, great health, even regeneration to an extent.  Attempt to talk your client into one of these alternatives.

If your client wishes for something more mundane like money or power, then this allows you to negotiate with the wish-granter - wishes like this are ideal, as they can be granted with no supernatural powers involved.

**If your client is Other**

This is the far more difficult situation.  The Other's goals are to weaken the Bounds, and they will attempt to twist wishes into requiring far more supernatural intervention than they would otherwise.  A "more money" wish that could be granted with a mere wire transfer might also be granted with a purse that always contains money, and the violation of thermodynamics would weaken the Bounds with every use.

However, your client will never disclose this as their stated goal.  Rather, they will request that you do your best to limit the scope of the wish but keep it open for Monkey's Paw style perversion.  That latter portion is where they will do most of the supernatural work, and so while you can easily do the former, the latter will be more difficult.

Again, look for opportunities to have the sting of the wish be mundane.  A money transfer, even from an Other, is entirely taxable.  Springing an audit on a wisher is a time-honored tradition, as is making their entire extended family aware of the newfound windfall.

**In Conclusion**

I know you weren't expecting this.  You got into Wish Law because you wanted to make sure your clients *weren't* getting a sting in the tail.  I'm sorry to have to tell you that it's more important than that, by far.  You're the first line of defense, and your duty is clear:

Keep the Bounds intact.
