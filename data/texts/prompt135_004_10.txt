I left the printmakers and made my way down the street which was dark and oily looking in the evening's drizzle. I was bone tired, my elbow hurt from printing and I hated the insipid mess I had made that day. The green looked like the walls of a hospital corridor. I had torn the worst one up in a rage and the rest would have been in tatters too if Will hadn't grabbed me and held my arms at my sides. 

"Keep them around," he had said, jovially, as I had contemplated spitting in his face. "If you want to be an artist you have to learn from your mistakes. And look, this one is fucking good!" I didn't think it was good. Will's opinion didn't change that. But he thought he was helping. He was the other kind of artist, the one who could start liking their work if someone better did. 

I walked down the steps into the train station, still wishing I had torn them all up. It would have felt cleansing. Will thought he knew what I needed better than I did. Was that because he was ten years older or because I was a woman? I would use crimson tomorrow I decided, rounding the corner onto the deserted platform. 

I slumped down in one of the plastic chairs and felt my phone vibrate in my coat pocket. It was my mother. 

"Hello?"
.
"Hi darling."
.
"Are you alright?"
.
"Yes, of course I am."
.
"What, you just called for a chat? It's late."
.
She sighed. "Could you come over tomorrow?" 
.
"You sound really strange..."
.
"There's nothing wrong with me. Please don't worry. I just want to show you something." 
.
"And you call me at 1 AM to tell me that?"
.
"Well I wasn't planning to. Show it to you, I mean. But I was lying here in bed, trying to sleep and I had the idea that you might want to see it."
. 
There was a pause. 
.
"Just come over tomorrow morning. Take a day off. That's what you should be doing at anyway, at least once a week. You're burnt out."

It was a newspaper article in The Chronicle. About Pat Holitz, who had died of a brain aneurysm earlier in the week. I stared at my mother, confused. 

"This is what made you call me in the middle of the night?"
.
"Yes."
.
"Thanks... Her style of art isn't really my thing though." 
.
"I never liked it either. Though I suppose I may have been biased."
.
She lit a cigarette. 
.
"Can I have one? When did you start again?" 
.
"Pat Holitz's son, Oscar, was your father. He's dead too, he went twelve years ago. Overdose. I didn't tell you that at the time because it didn't seem like something you needed to know. But Pat's different. I think you do need to know about her." 
.
I didn't know what to say. I didn't really feel anything. I stared at the portrait in the article, a wiry woman with thick grey hair and beetle black eyes. She stared coldly into the camera lens. "*Sour*..." I thought. "*She looks sour*..."
.
"The funeral is tomorrow. And there's a bonfire...  They're burning all her work afterwards. Everything she hadn't sold yet. Everything she had kept. Her request, according to this." She tapped the newspaper. "She even tweeted about it. Everyone thought it was a joke but it was there in her will. Apparently the art world is furious. Trying to stop it from happening."
.
"Fuck..." I said, faintly. 
.
"Would you like to go?"
