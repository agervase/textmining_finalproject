In the blind of an eye billions of immortals disappeared. No sounds. Just empty clothes flopping to the ground. Except me. I took the drug, technically I'm 79 years old and I look young as ever and yet still I'm here.

Then it happened. Delayed reaction I think. Then I see a white void. Is this heaven? From that old ancient religion that nobody but the silly Lost Generation believes in? I don't think I deserve heaven if I wasn't fine with the life span God gave me.

Then I realize I am not dead.

I am still breathing in this hellscape of bore.

I shout.

No avail, no whispers, no echoes. Only silence after the shout.

I sit here for who\-knows\-how\-long.

It feels like years, and it takes way too long that I might need food (mind you, in my old society food was only eaten to prevent being painfully malnourished).

Then I get bored. I've never meditated before, but I try. I try to imagine a spirit guide meeting me.

It's a woman in a blue flight attendant uniform named "Claire" or "Clarice".

I learned her name from asking. When I learned of her name it didn't seem like she told me, it was just the first thing that popped into my head in the chaos of my thoughts.

I attempted to ask if she was a friend.

No answer.

Then I imagined horrible things, a cavern made of snakes. The walls, the ceiling, the floor were all made of live moving snakes! With a giant snake moving throughout the cavern freely!

Then I imagined a giant sheet of metal, in which a small part morphed and twizzled and contorted into a face.

I tried to do what my mother taught me when I was little and imagined a giant bubbled protecting me from harm, but then a small chestnut\-looking gremlin emerged into existence inside.

I stopped trying to meditate.

Another long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long silence.

I got bored again. I don't usually get bored, the feeling has been replaced need for stimulation.

I don't understand why being bored has to feel so horrible. I understand that humans are a social creature but to quote that silly old thing, "JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!"

You know what? I'm not going to take this. I can will something to existence in this void.

It doesn't matter what it is, just come here and join on in. I don't care whether this huge mass of atoms converging is a chair or a fart. I want something.

An explosion occurs. The white void turns black.

If I had to say how it sounded, it would be, a Big "Bang".

Thank you peoples. Story's over. I don't usually write stuff on here. I don't have my own subreddit, nor do I want to create one because I'm not vain enough and my username fucking sucks.

Also, I'm not an atheist, that's just the character. I actually believe when you die you go where you believe.

Jews go to Jewish Heaven, Muslims go to wherever the fuck, Christians go to either protestant or catholic heaven etc.
