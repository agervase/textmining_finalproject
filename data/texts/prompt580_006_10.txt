March 2, 1949

The two people had come again. I didn’t like them. They smelled of cigarettes and gun oil. They were friends of my uncle who visited the mansion every so often. Usually something to do with his collection. They both wore black leather trench coats and gloves. They stood in the foyer dripping from the rain for a moment. The tall one, a man named Adam, had dark hair and a scruffy beard. He took off his hat.

“Alex, I know this must be hard for you. Your uncle never told you anything. He-” Adam said.

“He was afraid I would go crazy and kill everyone, I know. He left me a letter explaining everything.” I interrupted. They both frowned and stiffened up. The woman, Audrey, reached for her weapon but Adam stopped her. He kneeled down so that he was face to face with me. He put his hands on my shoulders.

“Your uncle did a lot of bad things. He hurt a lot of people. But, he felt that it was only way he could keep the world safe. With you, I think he wanted to try to make up for his sins. He wanted you to live and grow up. He wanted you to have a choice. If you want to seek revenge on the world I won’t stop you. But, if you want to honor his wishes and continue his legacy then I will do everything in my power to help you.” Adam said. For the first time since I learned of my uncles death tears rolled down my face. Unable to stop them I sobbed and embraced Adam.

June 16, 1987

Audrey had come to visit and had brought a new person. I learned later Adam had been killed. The new man was much younger. It was hard to concentrate because I could smell what he carried.

“Alex, this is my new partner. His name is Jonathan. I need to use the Castilian Chalice. Please come get me in two hours.” Audrey says. She nods to Jon and walks down the hall. Jon gives a nervous half bow.

“Hello. Um, pleased to meet you. Oh, this is for you!” He holds out the plastic bag. My tail twitches in anticipation. A delicacy from the outside world! I take it and inhale the aromas deeply.

“Pleased to make your acquaintance.” I say trying to remember my manners. 

“Let’s go to the kitchen!” I say, unable to contain myself any longer. Walking quickly we pass through doors that open and close themselves for me until we arrive in the new kitchen. Gleaming chrome metal and teal plastic laminate countertops line the room.

“Wow, this is totally retro.” Jon says.

“Retro?” I ask, unfamiliar with that word.

“Yeah, like, old fashioned.” He says.

“This isn't old. It was put here by my Uncle forty years ago.” I reply. I open the bag and take out the goodies. They called it ‘chinese food’. I had never been able to get the hang of chopsticks. Instead I preferred to pick up the battered chicken with my fingers. Well, really the tips of the long black claws that grew from my fingers and dip them in the sweet and sour sauce that way.

“Oh, I see.” He says while I devour the food. When finished I take a napkin and gently wipe the corners of my mouth.

“Please forgive my table manners. I forget myself sometimes.” I say.

“No, it’s cool.” He says.

“What do you want to do while we wait for Audrey?” I ask. He checks his wrist watch. It looks strange because it has no hands, just numbers.

“Well, it is almost 11 o’clock. Do you like to watch TV?” He asks.

“TV?” I cock my head to one side questioningly.

“Television.” He replies.

“Tele-vision?” I don’t understand what he means.

“Um, it’s a box with a screen and you can see moving images and sound on it.” He says scratching his head.

“Oh, like a Scrying Orb? I have a some of those.” I reply.

“Not exactly...it isn’t magic.” He say. I raise an eyebrow.

“Not magic? Then how does it work?” I ask.

“Uhhh...it uses electricity. You plug it in. And...there’s radio waves. You know, I don’t actually know how it works.” He confesses with a grin. His stomach rumbles.

“That’s okay, there are many things I don’t understand about the outside world. I’m sorry I ate all the chinese food. I can have Alice prepare some other food for you.” I say.

“Alice?” He asks.

“The housemaid. AAAALLLIIIIICCCCEEEEE!” I shout. Jon covers his ears for some reason. In a moment Alice appears in the doorway. She says nothing as usual but curtsies. 

“What is she?” Jon asks marveling at her porcelain skin.

“A golem. She will do anything I ask but she isn’t much fun to talk to.” I reply. For a long time I wondered if Audrey was a golem too because of how little either of them talked but unlike Alice, Audrey grew older.

“Well? What would you like?” I ask Jon.

“I guess I’ll have a sandwich.” He says. Alice prepares a ham sandwich with remarkable speed and efficiency. She places it on the table and curtsies.

“Thank you Alice, that will be all for now.” I say. She leaves the kitchen to return to her cleaning duties.

“We have some milk and juice in the icebox. Or water perhaps? I know you are not allowed to drink alcohol while on a mission.” I ask him.

“Water is fine, thank you. Wow, you are so kind. I didn’t expect it.” Jon says.

“You don’t smell like the others. Like cigarettes.” I say as I pour a glass for him and myself.

“Oh, yeah. There’s no smoking allowed in the office any more.” He says. I nod. We talked for a while longer. After the appointed time my guests leave.

September 30, 2018

Jon came to visit. After Audrey had passed away he had been alone for a while but now he had a new partner. He introduced her.

“Alex this is Lily. Lily, Alex. I’m returning the Crest of Sml'doon, thank you for letting us borrow it. May I use the Reflecting Pool?” He asks. I know what he wants by the heavy suitcase he carries.

“Yes, of course. Take your time.” I reply. I hardly notice the request however. Lily is carrying chinese food.

“Pleased to meet you.” She says, bowing. I return her bow.

“Pleased to meet you as well. Shall we?” I say gesturing to the kitchen. She nods. In the kitchen she watches in stunned silence as I gobble the chinese food.

“I apologize for being rude. It’s just so rare that I am able to eat food from the outside world.” I say as I wipe my hands and face.

“I understand. But, this kitchen. It looks old but it’s full of stuff. Can’t you make chinese food yourself?” She asks.

“I don’t know how to cook. And Alice will only cook things that are in her cookbook.” I say as I show her the yellowed cookbook. Lily flips through it and then checks the cover page.

“This book was published in 1888. Over half the recipes call for lard. That can’t be good for you.” She says.

“What’s wrong with that?” I ask.

“Well, as long as you don’t eat too much I guess that is fine.” she says.

“Oh, I am careful. I only ate three pigs and two chickens today.” I say, beaming at my restraint.

“How? Just. How? You don’t look any older than I am and except for a few...features you look human. Where do you come from anyway?” she asks.

“You think I look human?” I say, my eyes getting misty.

“That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. My uncle told me my egg had been found in 1669 and was kept in the possession of a certain family until 1912 when he acquired it. He had thought it was a fossilized egg until two years later when, as he put it, ‘a miracle happened’ and I hatched.” I say.

“That’s pretty cool. So what do you do for fun?” She asks.

“Well, except for the ones in the restricted vault my Uncle never forbade me from reading any of his books so I mostly read. Once I inherited his spell tomes I’ve been practicing magic.” I say.

“Wait, so you’ve been living in this mansion surrounded by magic items for over 100 years while studying spells for decades? How powerful ARE you?” She asks. I am taken aback. I had never even thought about it.

“I-I don’t know. I’m sorry I don’t have anything to compare myself with. Except for agents like yourself I don’t get any visitors.” I say, downcast.

“No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. It’s just this is all so new to me. Until a few months ago I didn’t even know magic was real. Now I’m studying magic myself and going on missions for a secret government agency. It’s pretty crazy to me.” She says. We exchange smiles.

“Can I touch them? Your horns?” she asks. 

“Sure, why not?” I shrug and lower my head. She gently feels them.

“Wow, these are so much cooler than mine. Oh, mine are fake. They are a costume.” She says.

“You wear a costume?” I ask.

“Sometimes. Want to see?” she replies. I nod. She takes out a small black rectangle. She touches it and the screen lights up.

“Is that a television?” I ask.

“No, this is my phone. Err, well I guess I could watch tv on it if I wanted to. Not here though. Your house has zero bars. Not even any wifi.” she says. I nod although I don’t understand what she means. The phone in the study doesn’t look anything like what she is holding. She shows me an image of her wearing an elaborate outfit and horns.

“Oh, it has photographs inside it!” I say.

“Yeah, this is my cosplay. There’s more.” She says as she swipes the screen and the image changes.

“Amazing.” I remark as the pictures of the outside world go by.

“I had no idea such things existed.” I say.

“You know, if you came to an event with me people would think you are just wearing a costume too.” She says.

“Me? Go with you?” I say with furrowed brows.

“I’ve never left the mansion. I don’t know....” I say, frowning.

“It’s cool if you don’t want to. You have stuff to do, I have stuff to do. No big deal.” she says.

“I want to. But I’m not sure if I can. What if something happens while I’m not home?” I say.

“Has anything ever happened in all this time?” she asks.

“No. The house can defend itself. You saw the doors and hallways shift while we were walking. Any intruders would be lost forever. And I suppose Alice would still be here...yes. I think I would like to go outside.” I say confidently.

“Well, then it’s a date!” She says smiling. I feel my cheeks flush.

“D-d-date?” I stammer.
