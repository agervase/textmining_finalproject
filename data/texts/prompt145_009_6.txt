I commuted to college.  One day I tossed my backpack on an arm chair when I got home.  Then, to my ferrets' delight, it was playtime!  I released the ferrets from their cage and they promptly ran about the apartment getting into mischief and vocalizing their soft and happy "dook." 

Someone knocked. As I walked toward the door, all three ferrets appeared from their explorations, dancing under my feet.  I wrangled the squirmy ferrets into my arms and opened the door.

Two Mormon missionaries stood in the entryway and asked if I knew about the Plan of Salvation. They noticed the ferrets doing their best to escape my hold.  The great outdoors is wonderful and unknown.  They must explore!  

My curiosity led me to invite them in.  I knew only the rumors of the LDS church and wanted  to find out what they really believed.  I released the three hooligans to the freedom of the apartment.  Of course, the missionaries became an target for natural curiosity.  

They sat on the couch across from me.  The ferrets explored their backpacks and tried to climb up their pant legs.  The missionaries were entertained and didn't mind the ferrets' antics. As we talked, the ferrets eventually lost interest and resumed their games. 

Merlynn was a little albino female.  Her favorite activities were  climbing, exploring, and stealing items for her stash.  To her joy, she had the chance to do all three.  She climbed the arm chair where the backpack sat.  I ignored her.  It was a normal activity and I thought I had the "forbidden" pockets zipped.  She found a wonderful item.  It crinkled and was light and easy to carry away: which she did.  In the intensity only a ferret has, she ran across the room carrying away her prize.  One stash spot was  where the missionaries sat.  They attempted to ignore a ferret diving  under the couch carrying a sanitary pad.  Yet, their faces turned an amusing shade of red. I just shook my head and sighed.  That's just Merlynn the Ferret.
