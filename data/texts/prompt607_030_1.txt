The grand hall of olympus was filled with the merry laughs and conversation of the gods as drink, drug and food came without end. 

As the feast carried on though the large golden doors to the hall burst inwards off their hinges coming down on the end if the table and almost crushing several minor gods who were sent scrambling. 

Through the smoking wound a hulking humanoid made of shadow that swallowed light  strolled through the mess heading straight for zeus at the end of the table. 

The anger was immediately replaced with fear as all eyes took the being in. Not a move was made, not even from Ares as they held their breath not daring to take eyes off of it. 

Upon reaching the god among gods the shadow reached in and threw down a mutilated corpse of a kid probably barely old enough to drive on their own. 

"I see you've met the latest champion, ■■■■■!" Zeus stated with merriment, seemimgly the only one unphased by this intrusion.

"You're very aware david that i take no pleasure in children." The shadow stated, before zeus threw his laughter in the beings face. 

"What i cant mess with you o..." zeus was sent over his chair and into the back wall as the shadow dug a blade as black as it into the gods golden eyes. 

"Always have been a coward zeus, a coward thats full of himself at that. Using children to fight your wars, disgusting."

 The halls were filled with the rare sounds of a god being tortured as the shadow picked and pulled zeus apart before his family, stuck helplessly watching and hoping they were not next. 

As the shadow pulled away from the lifeless red pile in the corner it had a final address to the leaderless gods. 

"Your days of child service is over now! What you do now i do not care, but send another child and i will send olympus to the darkest corner i can find." 

The only response they could muster was to kneel before this formless figure as it walked past. 

*now then to talk to odin about sending animals to fight me*
