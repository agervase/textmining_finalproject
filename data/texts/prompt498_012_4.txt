**First time writing, please be gentil**


I finish off my glass of Sex on the beach, the peach schnapps particularly strong this time. 

"Stupid Brett, how dare he dump me the day before spring break," I say to particularly no one. 

I had been drinking like this all week, I threw up a couple of times of course, but this week's spring break bender is what my sororities pledge week trained me for. Plus I was always Irish on saint Patrick's day. Just then the bar started to play my new jam, Beyonce's single ladies. I knew what I had to do. I ran to the dance floor and started dancing, after all, it's like she wrote it for me. I start doing the kicks and the hair flips like in the music video to the best of my ability, someone was filming me, I was probably making a fool out of myself but that's ok,  my soul song was playing. 

The song stopped playing and some dumb country song came on, I do not do country. I left the floor and was approached by some guy ranking 7 in looks. He starts to speak:

"Hey, that was pretty go--" 

I had to cut him off with my mouth, I knew what he was after and I was too impatient at that point. Plus, I just wanted to get laid. Hell, the best way of getting over someone is getting under someone (or at least according to my big sister Ashely). 

The next morning I woke up in a strange place with a pounding headache and text messages from both my sorority  sisters Katelin and Katelyn. They both sent me the same video of me dancing perfectly to Beyonce's Single Ladies. Eat your heart out Brett, I totally win this break up.
