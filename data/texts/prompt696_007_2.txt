Thump, thump, thump

The sound of damp pale skin made an almost inaudible sucking sound as it peeled off the wall between each thump. Jeff’s back was against the wall as he stared at the cell door. Ever so slowly tapping his head on the wall, anything to relieve the monotony of the cell. The straight jacket his captors had put him in kept him hands bound. Reduced his ability to move or make noise. Anything those bastards could do to keep him quiet. To keep him from exposing the truth. 

Just as Jeff’s thumping slowed the room was filled with the noise of metal dragging on metal then *click* as the door swung open. 

It was Murray. Thank fuck it was Murray. Jeff breathed a sign of relief. Of all the mouth breathing guards in this place Murray seemed the least intolerable. 

“How are we doing today Jeff “ 

“Fine Murray, just fine... you know you can’t keep me here forever. It’s going to get out. People are going to know eventually. If it’s not me it’s going to be someone else. You and your kind are just delaying the inevitable.” 

“Don’t worry Jeff, I passed your message along. I’ll follow up and see what they are going to come back with. But in the meantime you know the drill.”

Teal, orange and red/white capsules made their way from the cup in Murray’s extended hand into Jeff’s mouth. Jeff swallowed them without the aid of water. A skill he wish he hadn’t acquired in his time incarcerated. 

Murray made his way out of the cell and turned to grasp the door latch behind him. 

“Galaxies Murray, fucking galaxies man. I’ve seen them...”

Jeff’s eyes closed as the rapid acting drugs begun the cycle of their next hold on his consciousness and his head slumped against the wall in the corner of the cell.

“I know Jeff, I know” Murray sighed.
