My family has always been a weird one. I don't know what my parents or my aunt and uncles were thinking when they gave us these names. Maybe they knew, knew what would happen. No use pondering it now. We're at the end of the journey, it's been a long time coming but finally we're at the end. 

No one saw it coming. They must have been planning this for a long time. When it started it was hilarious a joke that the rest of the world laughed at. No one realized just how quickly the Ricks would take over from there. It was already a fairly common name but then came the kicker. They started with a simple request, a request for some discontinued McDonald's sauce. Little did we know that was just to make them look insane and fun. Soon more and more parents were naming their kids rick. All out of some insane joke. By the time these kids had turned into tiny Ricks the parents had realized their mistake. They were monsters obsessed with drinking, partying, and all around not giving a shit about others. However the Ricks had overtaken the news so nothing was ever put out about them and once again everyone found them hilarious. Eventually with their popularity soaring they overtook the government and formed the council of Ricks.

They had support from all the other common names so it was up to my brothers, my sisters, my cousins to stop them. The only people that they had no influence over. Why because our family has long held to a belief and named their kids in the same manner.

"All right let's do this, 
Never, Gonna, Give, You, Up take the left flank. 
Let, You, Down, Run, Around, And, Hurt, Yoouu take the right. 
We'll take down these Ricks.
