*The scene opens up to the captain of the ship in his office. He is drinking some whiskey from a glass.*
*A man walks in wearing a lab coat and spectacles. He appears to be a scientist*
Scientist: "Sir, reports have come back from the reconnaissance team we sent out earlier. They claim to have seen no alien life forms in 2/3 search areas we set up within the zone." 
Captain: "Really? I thought that zone was supposed to be crawling with aliens from your own estimations."
Scientist: "Well, they found one thing... Humans..."
Captain: "Humans? Are you fucking kidding me?!"
*The captain gets up from his desk and puts down the whiskey*
Scientist: "I'm afraid so sir. What are we going to tell them?"
*The captain calms down to think. He picks his whiskey back up and walks over to the window over looking space*
Captain: "How many other people know about this already?"
Scientist: "Just you and me. The reconnaissance android's memory haven't been properly searched yet. I know you wanted me to look ahead for you."
Captain: "Good, good. I want you to wipe the "revealing" parts of their memory, then report back to me when you're done."
Scientist: "So you're not going to tell the ship?"
Captain: "No. We can't let everything crumble now. If those people find out about the lies of the ships origin, they would riot. We'd be overthrown."
*The captain sips his whiskey, still staring out of the window*
Captain: "I can't let everything fall now."
*The scientist remains silent and now somewhat nervous*
Captain: "Now go, quickly. If my watch is right you should have,"
*The captain looks down at his watch*
Captain: "An hour before the androids are checked."
*The scientist walks out of the room. The captain looks at Earth which is visible from his window.*
*End of scene*
