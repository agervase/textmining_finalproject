**Photographer's Spirit, Sniper's Soul**

I was a mess.  Fighting had been going on in the city for a week.  My hair was full of dust from various explosions and powdered concrete, blood smeared my cheek where a road rash on by face had bled.  I sipped at the beer, the first I'd been able to find in weeks.

"Took some good shots, huh?  I've been in it myself.  See that tower?  Through the window, that bell tower?  Before this city was secure, I got some of the best shots of my life."  His face was grizzled, a week's growth of beard obscuring his jaw, and a scar snaked down his face like a disfiguring rope.

I looked out at the tower, and smiled. "Must be nice.  All that elevation, just you and the wind."  

He nodded, and sipped at his drink; it smelled like kerosene.  "Forty-x.  Could see the whites of their eyes."

I imagined it - the wind in your hair, able to look down into the crowd, picking out individuals without worrying about them seeing you and changing their behavior, ruining a careful shot.  You could read thoughts in their expressions from so far away.  "That's serious magnification.  It's always best then they're unaware.  You can anticipate the moment, frame your shot two steps ahead."

He gestured with the cup, pointing past it at me. "You know how it is.  You pick your place, you look for your shot.  Sometimes you don't get a thing, sometimes you just just the one perfect shot, and sometimes everything you do is gold."

I nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.  "The day before yesterday, I was with some men guarding the west road.  No visibility at all, just blown dust.  Yesterday, I was death itself."  I picked up my rifle, setting it my shoulder - my hand drifted over the scope, almost caressing it, stroking the air.

"You're . . . talking about killing people."

Confused, I looked up, finding his green eyes on mine, shocked.   "Wait . . . what are YOU talking about?"
