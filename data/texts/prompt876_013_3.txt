Somebody had scratched a crudely-drawn cock into the gilded pillars flanking Heaven’s gates. I stepped over angel passed out on the drift of clouds that led up from Purgatory. His young face, or hers, I could never tell with these pious androgynous wingmen, was flushed and speckled with translucent orange vomit. Good Christ, I whispered under my breath. Or very bad Christ, because Jesus was definitely behind this. 


The rockstar prophet hadn’t adjusted well to life in heavens above and regularly invited the arseholes from downstairs to wreak havoc in the God’s skyscape. I suspected I’d walk into the lobby to find him passed out on a couch, Lucifer - amid a gaggle of deceased lawyers and politicians - stirring a hangover cure with a pitchfork nearby and looking far too sober for a fallen angel with a hangover.


“What the fuck is going on?” I shouted as I entered the cavernous space, boxed in by impossibly tall and obnoxiously shiny walls. My voice echoed, a manic response: *fuck is going on, going on, going on*. But as I looked around, I felt the vice of anxiety and uncertainty begin to tighten around my gut. 


The innards of the plush couches which populated the lobby, and housed the patient backends of incoming do-gooders, were strewn across the mosaic floor. The snow-like fluff convened with shredded flaps of fabric, shattered mortar and splintered wood that orbited heaped piles of feathers and clothing, shattered harps, fingers-
“Good lord.”


There were dozens of them, angels splayed out in the ruins in impossible shapes, their wings snapped, their bodies broken, their blood pooling and congealing in the wreckage. I felt suddenly cold in the orange glow glaring through the lobby’s open roof, a shiver shaking through my body despite the carefully controlled temperature of the Promised Land.


Just two steps away from me a young, pale face splattered with gore was turned towards me, gray eyes peering from inside the scarlet mask. 


“Well, this is a bit awkward,” said a low voice behind me, making me jump. “Whoa, easy there Pete.”
I turned to see tall man in a tailored suit standing framed between the Pearly Gates. He was stroking a sharp black goatee that faded upwards into a narrow, but handsome face. Long black locks spilled out over his shoulders, and two keen blue eyes peered from below onyx eyebrows that seemed like they had been hand-stitched by the same outfitter behind the blazer.


“Want a cigarette?” said Lucifer, pulling his hand from his jacket pocket, a carton of Camels clasped between his slender, manicured fingers.
