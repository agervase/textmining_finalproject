Dark black hair and chocolate eyes, that's me. I can be anyone. I could be the guy you sit next to in class or your coworker from around the corner. And as for gender? It doesn't matter, what does matter is the next few paragraphs that forever changed my perception of what I considered right, and is right. 

God knows we have a set of rules constructed by ourselves in order to keep anarchy at bay. It's what separates us from the animals. But what happens when these hypothetical animals nudge shoulders with you or ask at checkout "cash or credit?". How can we know that people aren't just using they're outer appearance to mask the little thing inside us we call a soul. 

Saturday 7:00am

I follow my regular routine. Wake up, brush my teeth, shower, and take out the dog. That's when my regular routine ends. It's a Saturday, no work. I grab a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch and sit at the table with a spoon in one hand and my cellphone on the right. About to read the news when I hear a squeal outside. My dog always does this when he wants to come inside and I know it's bad to give in to bringing him in but if it gets him to shut up I'm not complaining. I love the ol' guy.

Just as I am about to unlock the door I hear whispers outside.

"3,2,1".

Silence.

My vision is blurry but I can faintly see a score of men surrounding me. With one of them examining me and updating another person in the room. My eye lids try desperately to stay open but I let my brain take control and kept them shut. My vision is gone for now so my hearing is now my guide.

"Vitals check out, she should be able to hear us now."
 

"Good, let it rest."

"Also go check on Fido, bless his heart. If it wasn't him it was definitely going to be this person."

FOLLOWING IS NOT APART OF THE STORY.

To tired to continue. If you guys enjoyed let me know :)
