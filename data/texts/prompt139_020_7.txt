Blindness is one of the most scariest things that anyone could experienced in their life. It's a visual impairment where someone can't see anything even light but I was very lucky because a doctor suddenly appeared out of nowhere in front of my house and asked my consent to perform a 'surgery' and he said it was free. So, here I am, lying down as the nice doctor undo the bandage gradually after doing the surgery for 10 hours straight.

"So, Jane, tell me how you feel?" He asked, carefully unwrapping the door to my soul, for the first time since I was born. 

&#x200B;

"I could see the 'light'. I feel liberated as if someone opened the door where my eternal darkness lies." I could feel a warm sensation sliding down on my cheeks.

&#x200B;

"Good. You can open your eyes fully now. Are you ready to see the real world?" He smirked. 

&#x200B;

At a leisurely pace, I opened my eyes and I could see the doctor smiling down at me. His green eyes sparkled and his brown long hair was flying in the air. My mouth was wide-opened and I couldn't close my eyes, "Is this... the real world? Is that colors all around me?"

&#x200B;

He laughed hysterically, "It worked! The surgery worked!" 

&#x200B;

All of a sudden, I could feel a strange warm sensation in my eyes and the doctor gasped as my eyes was radiating blue lights all over the place inside the room. After a few minutes, my eyes stopped and I closed it as I was groaning in pain, "What the heck was that?!"

&#x200B;

The doctor's face was frozen in shock and before he could answered my question, a bird hit the window and broke into the room and I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was a very strange bird with a rainbow feather and injured wings. There was a growling thunder outside and the rain was pouring down vigorously, blurring the view. 

&#x200B;

"Where are we?!" I asked, running to the window and barely able to see. 

&#x200B;

"This is impossible! There are no animals near this hospital!" He shouted, examining the bird. 

&#x200B;

"Doctor! You have to take a look!" I said as I touched the flowers and it turned into a myriad of butterfies.

&#x200B;

"Looks like it's a success. The surgery. And apparently she's got a gift. Alex, I should be thankful to you. Thank you for doing this. Finally, we can search our child after so many years."

&#x200B;

"You welcome. It's a miracle she's got this gift. Now, one last thing we need to do is..." Alex put a bandage around Jane's eyes and smiled, "With this, we can proceed to the next step."
