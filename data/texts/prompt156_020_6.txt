These days, every crew has a pet human. My name is Kelly, and I'm the human for the *Kreeonk*, which apparently means something very pretty and also kind of incomprehensible in our language. I think they made that up so I wouldn't know they named their ship "The Pretty Lady" or some such thing. Been on the ship for about two years now, and it's a pretty good gig for a girl like me. Mostly, I'm the cook. It turns out, out here human food is this kind of exotic delicacy. When I responded to the ad, it didn't really specify what the human would be doing on board, but when they saw I'd packed a deep fryer, they threw me in the galley with a bunch of potatoes immediately.

The *Kreeonk* is...well, weird is the best way I can describe it. Humans spent decades and billions of dollars designing a hunk of metal just to get us to Mars, and when we finally figured out the warp bubble and left the solar system, it was in an ugly-but-functional metal sphere. So the first time we saw one of the alien cruisers, it kind of blew us away. The *Kreeonk,* like all of its brethren, looks more like an iron sides from the Civil War than anything else. It's got an open deck, and two giant masts with sails, and a big rudder in space. The difference is the two giant, rune covered rings that encircle the whole deck. Apparently, that's how they make it go to light speed - haven't gotten to see that yet, the crew has to stay below during a jump.

Anyway, it turns out our not-too-distant Alpha Centauri neighbors have figured out how to "attune their bodies to the natural forces of the universe," and some of them can spit fireballs or summon giant creatures. The most powerful of them can make the spells last, which is how you get magical flying spaceships and breathable air on an open deck in space. Like I said, weird. TeeDee, the cabin boy, tells me that we're the first alien species to make it to space the other way, by figuring out the math and building stuff with our own hands. Everyone else in the Arcanum of the Heavens just magicked their way up.

So why a pet human? Well, it turns out we humans have some pretty good ideas. Computers, for one. They'd been just writing shit down for ten thousand years before we showed up with pentium processors and everything. When interstellar trade started, most humans found that the aliens really wanted that ten year old PC that was gathering dust in their garage. We've got one on the *Kreeonk*, running Windows XP. And it's up to me to keep it running.

So yeah, cook and tech support for a PC from about a century ago. That's what humans are good for, I guess. I was never the tech girl at school, and I hated to cook when I was a kid, but hey, I get to see the stars this way.

Today, the *Kreeonk* is headed to the Mekon nebula on an absolute routine mission for the Arcanum, where we're going to get some readings, take some samples, and sit in one spot for hours doing nothing. In my experience, that means we're going to be attacked by pirates, crash into a star, and end up having a dance party with some indigenous life form.

Life in the stars is pretty sweet. More to come.
