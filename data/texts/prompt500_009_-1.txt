It was supposed to be a _fucking easy_ job.

All we had to do was getting into the vault on the last floor, where an ancient collection of cards owned by a really rich man, called _the Joker_, grab them and then get the hell out of there.

Except it wasn't.
We first understood that something was wrong when the timelock of the vault showed that we needed the fingerprint of _fucking llama_  .
How we were supposed to find a _fucking llama_ while trying to be silent and not get caught by police?

_Bain voice echoed in the radio transmitters_ 
_My man in the inside told that this damned sick fuck of the joker has a personal llama in his office. Don't ask me why. You guys gotta get up there, find the llama and take it to the vault._

I looked for the time on the clock on my left arm, and it said 9:05am. 
_Damned Bain and his fucking "easy job",_ I thought by myself.

I couldn't even describe how lucky we were while catching the llama. Wolf almost got busted,  but managed to take down the guard before he could give the alarm. The llama was roaming in the Joker's office. We had to give it a good 'ol knock in the head because that damned thing had to stay quiet.

While heading back to the vault, we saw a group of nuns entering the door at the first floor of the building. 

_Why the fuck the Joker needs nuns? Maybe he's into somecosplay shit._  Chains said. Everyone busted in a small laugh.

We eventually got to the vault. It was 14:30. We had 4hours to complete the job.We scanned the llama fingerprint (I don't know if  you could call that thing "a fingerprint") and  the timelock started,so we had to patiently wait undercover.

When the timelock finished we got into the vault. Everyone started grabbing the card from the display stands, and when done, we started to count them. 

_Where is the seven of clubs?_ I said. 

_Try to count again_ Chains said.

_I know how to count you idiot!_

We heard a noise. The llama  had the seven of clubs in his mouth and was trying to eat it. 

_Now everyone, slowly,  go near the llama and take it down. Gently, we need the card to be intact._

Then the llama swallowed the card. 

_Great. Now we gotta get that thing vomiting_  said Bain on the radio, after we reported to him what happened.

_I will make the thing vomit_

 I sighed. And , looking for the llama , I stood frightened while the it was trying to eat a nun's habit. Turned out they were real nuns, and that the Joker was an asshole but also a "man of faith" because of his family tradition.

Seeing the llama, everyone of the security looked to the vault. The only occasions in which the lama llama was allowed to be outside where when the joker had to unlock the vault. And the Joker today wasn't in the building.

The alarm started to sound loud in the building. It was a matter of minutes and the police was already doing the first assault.  We captured a few nuns cause hostages were always useful.

It was all going downhill.

It is 15:26  now. I am trying to make the llama vomit, and I only have four rounds left in my shotgun. Chains is punching a nun for whatever reason. The police is doing the fourth assault. My left arm is bleeding because of a stupid ass cloacker.

_Damn._
 I sighed.

So as usual, I shouted : _I NEED A MEDIC BAG_!
