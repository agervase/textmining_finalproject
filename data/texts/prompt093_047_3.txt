"Thank you for calling tech solutions, My name is Arquillius..." I start to say, only to find myself no longer in front of my pc...

"What the actual?" I start to add, getting up from my seated position on the floor.

"Hark, Demon! I am the wizard Agaroth, and I have summoned ye to do my bidding." The sorcerer says as I peer over at him.

"Ooooookay, but Unless you need your p.c. tuned up, or a virus removed you're sort of shit out of luck." I say looking him up and down.

"I have no knowledge of this pee see you speak of." The wizard says.

"Listen, then whatever bidding you want, you probably aren't gonna get. I mean, I can't tune up a mac like I can a pc, and don't get me started on linux or pi man... I can't even remote to those." I explain.

"I have no knowledge of these." The wizard says rubbing his chin.

"Well..." I start.

Several hours pass and I'm still standing there, talking to the guy.

"And that's why i vape instead of smoking. Better for the wife's asthma." I say.

"Interesting. So what you're telling me is that the metal wand you bear is a magic pipe that needs not be lit." The wizard says.

"Yep. that's all there is to it. As for the other stuff, well you probably won't get into that for a few millenia." I add.

"But tell me more of this, what did you call it? The Rangers of power?" The wizard asks.

"Oh right, we got off on a tagent with that. Now where was I... ah Yes, so the Green ranger..." I continued.

A few hours more passed.

"Well that's that." I say.

"Thank ye kind demon, you have given me much to think on." The wizard says.

"Don't thank me. i'm just your friendly neighborhood Tech Expert. If you're ever in Vegas, look me up." I say.

"I shall do that." He says before whisking me back to my chair, just as my next phone rings, my manager and supervisor pming me like madmen wondering where I was for the past 6 hours... How to explain this?
