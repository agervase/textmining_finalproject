So there I was staring at this blur swaying trying to keep upright, the blur looked familiar till I had focused and then the horror struck me, it was me the blur was me but... different he was clean shaven well dressed. 

 It was hard day at work and a even harder season at the pub, its all becoming to frequent after Laura left, we were so close till little Suzzy got leukemia it all happen so fast, that was a bull shit hand to be dealt with, everything at home went to shit after that. The drink had got me but I still held down a job, not sure for how long though the sympathy window was closing fast, everyone is over stressed with the new cuts in funding, social services are not a priority so it seems to those who probably never needed them. 

Getting in the car took longer than usual, it was a Friday night in February the cold frosty air made my figures numb and the neon lights from the pub sign flashed every other second which didn't help, I was alright to drive so I told my self at 3 am it was hard to convince the staff but fuck them they don't understand shit, cars drive them self on country roads.

Last I remember was the drowsiness the heavy eyelids pulling down and the road levitating and swirling and falling into a pit of darkness, there I was surrounded in lost memory's buried emotions nulled by drink, thats were the blur walk through that murky haze with sympathetic caring eyes. That was the moment I felt the weight of it all a mixture of what i have become and the person I was, his arm reach out to me and touched my forehead I felt very warm the way it was with little Suzzy and Laura then it all went blurry again fading away, there I  felt like i was home and did not want to leave but something was pulling me back.....

The beeps were mechanical slowly bringing my groggy mind into wakefulness I felt so heavy and slow, a warm hand rubbing my face I open my eyes and of all people it was Laura staring at me, the hospital room said it all how I got there. She spoke softly "thought we lost you there for a while, I think its time you come home, I still love you very much and I cant live with losing you aswell" at that moment I felt at peace and all I wanted was to go home.
