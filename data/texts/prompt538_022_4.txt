Sometimes things happen that defy logic, science, and what we consider reasonable.  A Glimpse was one of those things.  Different people interpreted a Glimpse as something their world view could accept.  Scientists believed it was a electromagnetic phenomenon.  Spiritual leaders believed it was two halves of the same soul reaching for each other across time and space.  Religious leaders say it is a vision from God to help the wayward find their soul-mate.

The mechanics of a Glimpse were simple enough to the two people involved in it.  They would feel the tug starting about once a month when they woke.  It inevitably happened when they were both awake.  There were accounts of people waking from a dead slumber to experience it, too, but there was always some kind of warning, some kind of opportunity to get out of harms way or to push the Glimpse away until it was safe to experience.  It would build like pressure in ones mind, until the barriers fell and the two minds would swap awareness’ for a brief window.  A nearly sixty second window into another life.  You would see what they see, feel what they feel, and hear what they hear.  A life that was your perfect match, like two pieces of a puzzle.  Only some people got the Glimpses, no one knew exactly why, no one could explain it neurologically, and the results of radio frequency testing were inconclusive.  One of life’s mysteries, so they say.

I started having Glimpses when I was entering puberty.  I was about 13 when I started feeling unusual in class during eight grade.  I could feel something like a headache, mild pressure behind my eyes, all day.  Then as my mind was drifting in class (I was prone to daydream like most eighth graders) it happened.  My world splintered and I felt like I was whisked far away from myself for a split second.  Color dissolved into static gray and then reformed into a new scene.  There was a women in a blue dress with a white bow-belt on speaking to me in a language I was unfamiliar with.  It sounded like the vowels were too long, and the consonants too soft.  She was looking at me and I was staring, stunned, at the chalk board.  I tried to stand up, but nothing was working correctly.  I was off-balance, and as I looked down, realized that I was wearing a green dress, and had breasts.  Newly formed and not quite shaped like grown woman curves.  I was a girl!  The woman was talking to me rapidly and then I flailed with my arms and fell out of my desk.  The other children stopped to look at me, and the woman, I presume a teacher, rushed to my side.  The vision broke apart into a thousand splinters of static and reassembled into my classroom with me sitting sideways on the floor and my teacher trying to help me to sit up.  

&#x200B;

“What happened Ryan?  Are you all right?”, my teacher asked me.  My mouth worked for a moment and I reattached to myself.  After what seemed like an eternity I could speak again.  “I’m OK now.  I was somewhere else for a minute.  I feel strange.”, I sputtered.  “Let’s get you to the nurse’s office.”, Mr Burke said gently.  

&#x200B;

We left the classroom and headed down the hall.  Mr Burke said, “It sounds like you may have just experienced a Glimpse.  Have you ever had one before?”

I had heard of the Glimpses but had never thought about it actually happening to me before.  “I… I… don’t know.”, I replied.  “Well, the nurse can help you understand it better.  It happens to a lot of folks and is perfectly normal.  You’ve got nothing to fear and maybe a lot to look forward to.”, he said with a smile and continued, “Some people think that the Glimpses show us who we’re supposed to be with.”  That put me off a bit.  I wasn’t quite sure how I felt about girls yet.  They were a little weird to my eighth grade self.  

&#x200B;

Mr Burke delivered me to the nurse and we watched the “So you’ve had a Glimpse” video.  It was a 1990s film that desperately needed some updating, but it got the point across that the Glimpses would happen about once a month and showed you the world through someone else’s eyes.  It also cautioned you to be careful about how much personal information you shared with your glimpse-partner, and had the obligatory horror stories of one ill-fated young woman who was murdered by her glimpse-partner.  

&#x200B;

It got around eighth grade that I had gotten a glimpse and I was a momentary celebrity, until Brittaney Jones got hers and it was another girl.  Eighth graders are notoriously fickle.  I started to be able to anticipate the Glimpses after a couple months and my glimpse-partner and I started to cautiously exchange small bits of information.  We would wear a purpose designed cuff with writing on it.  I figured out that she was French and lived in the southern part of France.  I started to learn French in ninth grade, to more effectively communicate.  

&#x200B;

We exchanged our first names only (as was customary for those who were glimpse-bonded at fifteen).  “Elise”  It sounded so beautiful when I said it.  During once of our Glimpses she said my name, “Ryan” and it sounded like something I had wanted to hear my whole life, but just didn’t know I needed to.  I said her name back, and I felt the excited, nervous, elating chills run through me/her.  It stole my breath and left my heart racing.  I knew there was something incredible about her.  I could feel it, just the way every fifteen year old who’s ever been near a member of the opposite sex is.

&#x200B;

Her parents and mine both were cautioning us on sharing too much information, but we felt a strong connection.  Still, it was my freshman year of college before we actually exchanged phone numbers.  I was fluent enough in French (and she in English) that we could communicate without barriers.  My family wasn’t well off, nor was hers, but we decided on that phone call that we had to meet.  I worked extra hours at the school computer lab, helping people with lost passwords, printing jobs, and general help.  She worked at a bakery in her town to save money to meet.  We spent a lot of time on Skype video chatting.  Thus passed my sophomore and part of my junior year in college.

&#x200B;

 Eventually we had enough saved to meet in London for a week.  Suddenly, the dream was a reality, and I was terrified.  I boarded the plane, and flew to London Heathrow.  As luck would have it, I could feel a Glimpse pending for today, which didn’t help with the  nerves.  I was a bit early, and her flight arrived half an hour after mine.  I was sitting on a bench in baggage claim with my modest suitcase, when the glimpse happened.  I had been looking at the barista (a young man with a purple mohawk) idly when the the glimpse hit.  I could see the top of the same mohawk around a corner and then I swung into view on the bench.  

&#x200B;

The glimpse was different this time, a thousand times more intense.  I could feel her breathing from the inside, I could feel the weight of her steps.  I could feel her emotions. The trepidation, the excitement, and the love. I stood up and ran to her using her eyes as my own, and she ran towards me.  We embraced, and the world shattered into a billion shards.  It was a cacophony of senses merging, settling into place.  Like a wave of pure joy and the completion of perfect love it washed over us both.  I could feel the light inside her and I felt my own light radiating from the inside out.  The two souls we are were made into a whole greater than the sum of it’s parts in that instant.  We cried, we laughed, we held each other for a very long time, and made quite a scene, which neither of us noticed one bit.

&#x200B;

But… there was something more to it, that’s what the doctors said.  We retained something that most glimpse-partners didn’t.  We were able to share vision, presence, hear what the other hears.  Not just during the glimpses, but all the time now.  It was more of a state of being.  It had happened before, in recorded medical science, but not often.  It had something to do with being physically united for the first time during a glimpse, or at least that was one theory.  All we knew is that we were together, whenever we wanted to be, instantly, sharing one heart, one mind, but yet, being ourselves, as well.  It was remarkable, and yet as natural as breathing to us.  

&#x200B;

We married, of course, and had children.  Three of them, Jacques, Marie, and Evelyn.  Jacques just turned thirteen and fell off the couch.  He said he saw a red haired girl in a mirror getting ready for bed, and she had screamed “Ma!” with an Irish accent.  I imagine I know where this is going…
