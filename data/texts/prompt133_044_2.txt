  "It's been a while since I've last seen him..." I sighed, tracing my finger around the rim of yet another empty glass. Alcohol. Didn't matter what kind, they all tasted bland now. The corners of my mouth, adorned with black lipstick, turned upward in something reminiscent of a smile. His favorite color was black. I was wearing a flowing dress of the same color. Bittersweet, really. I turned back to the confused bartender. "He should be here soon. He always comes." The man raised an eyebrow. "Ma'am, I'm not quite sure what this has to do with me." "You wouldn't know, would you? Don't worry your poor soul over it. Do you have a wife, perchance? Family?" He took two steps away from me, in a semi-discreet manner. "No, Ma'am...perhaps you've had too much to drink." I simply shook my head. "Not enough, more like." Before I could change my mind, I smashed the glass over the counter and rendered the man dead with the sharp, now bloodied end of the stem.
     I decided that I would serenade him. There were plenty of songs about him, after all. The only thing bigger than his ego was his scythe. I removed the man's phone from his back pocket and selected a song to play, *The Show Must Go On, by Queen.* I increased the volume to its max and sat patiently on the barstool, awaiting his arrival as the man's pulse left him.
     Sure enough, he arrived in a short explosion of shadow, which clung to his skin and hung in a haze about his eyes.
     "On time as always, I see." I gazed at him. He was wearing a deep, midnight suit with a long tailcoat, and his emerald green eyes glimmered slightly just behind the haze. His style always seemed to update with the era, but his looks were timeless.
     He grinned at me, an expression so cold and emotionless yet so enticing that only he could manage. **"You called? Darling, you know I'm awfully busy."** I hummed a bit to the song. "I missed you. Why don't you come over here and give me a kiss? Take my soul while you're at it, love." He strode over, every step causing me to shudder. **"You know very well why not, Darling."** His black gloved hand lightly stroked my cheek, which filled me with a chill. 
     
*I was a teenager at the time, young and rambunctious. I can hardly remember what era, what year, time is quite a blur. I do remember the moment vividly, though. My brother was sick and dying of the plague. So was I. Antony was so young, too young... but Death does not discriminate. He came to take him, put him to rest. I was dying too, but I wasn't ready to let go. As he drew my soul from my body, in a last act of defiance, I stomped on the edge of his cloak. His hood fell. Two piecing, emerald eyes stared back at me, burning with fury, and an ageless tiredness I couldn't comprehend. He didn't say a word then. Simply replaced his hood, and strode off with my brother's soul toward a golden gate I couldn't reach. I was released back into my body and have been immortal ever since.*

   "Surely we can put the past behind us, can't we?" I said sweetly. I retrieved the stem of the wineglass and placed it in his gloved hand. "Forgive me, love." He only grinned wider, dropping the stem and refusing me his embrace once more. **"Not on your life, Darling. If you wanted so strongly to refuse me, then your wish shall be granted forevermore."** "Love, please. I've done so much to be with you. Can't you see that?" He only grinned wider, and the deepest parts of my soul burned so hot it froze. **" Lovely song, darling. I suppose I'll be seeing you again, in another lifetime or so."** I could only watch on once more as he escorted another soul to their eternity. It was a lovely song indeed. I would play another when I saw him again.
