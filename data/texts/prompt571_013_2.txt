it's a day like any other, i mean why wouldn't it be. everything's the same, day in and day out. I'm so sick of this hellhole, so tired of these people. i wish this would end so i could be with her again.  
she was my anchor, my pillar and the only thing that made life worth living. she was my everything and he took her away. he left me to rot in this hell of a world and then he took her away. why is god so cruel? why has he resigned me to live a life without her.  
i still remember the day i met her and the day i lost her, perhaps the most remarkable days of my entire life.after i met her I slowly got to know her and with each passing day she became more  beautiful. if only it could have stayed that way and if only life had not happened. i remember being with her. it was the most happiest time of my life. every day was bright sunny and bearable. even if i walked into a dark room her presence would lighten me up.
whenever she would cry i was there to hold her, caress her. when ever she smiled i'd join in and sure that would be a little awkward but it was our own special thing.   
we loved each other. she was there for everything in my life,everything important that is. she stood like a pillar through thick and thin. she helped me get through the day. but it was not meant to be. and like every good thing it came to an end. i still hear the sirens the day i lost her. still hear my heartbeat as they took her away in an ambulance and as our life together came to an end.  
We were at the prime of our life when i lost her. we hap never been more happier, every time we saw each other wee smiled,we never fought and she always listened to what i said and so did i. why did they have to come between us? what business do the cops have in messing with my happiness? what right have they got to take her away from me?
