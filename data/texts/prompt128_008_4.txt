"So.... What's this key for?" The man behind the desk looked tired, this had been the longest four years of his life, and he was counting the hours until it was no longer his burden.

"It is for everything, I surrender, its all yours." a stout man in military dress continued to try and push the key into the presidents hands. "Do you know how hard it is to act crazy all the time? It was only fun for the first ten years, after that... what is the point of life if you always win.."

"Well here's the thing Kim, I don't know what you are trying to pull but I won't be part of whatever it is you are planning, please leave before I have Fred shoot you for trying to ruin my last day."

"This is no trick, I just want to have a normal life. Go without the luxuries I have grown accustomed to. Settle down with a nice lady, grow old as we raise our children. These are things I cannot have as Kim Jong Un."

"So what am I supposed to do with this?" The man behind the desk gruffly questioned, visibly growing red with annoyance. "Just walk to North Korea's front door, unlock it, walk right in, and I suppose everyone will be happy to see us of course!"

"Not quite" the man smirked as laid the silver key on the desk. "This will shut down all communications, missile systems, and radar for my country, if you act quickly while it is down I would imagine a small force would be sufficient for my countrymen to surrender."

"And that's it huh? You just leave and we go take your country?"

"Precisely." And with that he turned on the spot and walked to the door, pausing for a moment he turned back.

"By the way Mr. President, good luck with your re-election campaign, you are sure to be favored now."
