I stared at the rings and rings of people around me. Each one bearing a smile and looking at me, seeming to hold back coming forward as if waiting for me to speak. I'd heard of your loved ones being transported to you before you died, but I didnt recognize any of these people. The crowd seemed to go on forever, off my porch and down the street. I couldn't see the end of the mass. I looked to the closest person, a women in her 30s, as she stepped forward. 

"I don't understand, all my loved ones passed years ago. Who are all of you?"

"You don't know us, but we know you. You saved our lives, every last one of us."

"I did?"

She smiled brightly,  "As often as you could for sixty years you donated plasma that was used to save everyone of us as children. All two million four hundred and thirty thousand eight hundred and six of us."

I could only stare, my mouth haven fallen open. I looked back out to the crowd, all smiling and some with tears or waving. I couldn't help but smile myself and let out a laugh though tears streaked my cheeks. As if now given permission, one by one they begin to come forward and give me a hug. Some tell me what has happened in there lives that they are thankful to me for, most just give a "thank you". But everyone one makes their way by me, someone they only know through stories or the news, yet hug me like family. It takes far longer than an hour for everyone to visit me, but I think death made an exception, just this once. When the last person has let me go and walked away, disappearing back to where they had been before being teleported, I felt a contentedness fill me like I had never experianced before and went home.
