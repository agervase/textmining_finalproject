It was a cold, dark night, but the flashes of the smartphones lit up the courtyard like a ballroom. Harry stood on one end, finishing his mug of butterbeer, a ritual he did before every battle to ready himself. Voldemort was waiting on the other side, his crew of death eaters laughing at his every joke.

Harry had been training for seven years now. He was a bit of a prodigy, dropping punchlines so brutal Draco was once burned to the third degree. But Voldemort was something else. His rhymes didn't stun, they didn't burn, they killed. Harry would need to bring the thunder to even stand a chance. 

After one last joke, Voldemort signaled his minions to shut up. A slow beat started playing. It was slow, fat, heavy, ominous. As Voldemort started rapping, mystic shapes started forming around him.

*I don't need to do this, I've already won*

*Dumbledore, Black, Snape, your dad and your mom*

*I've killed everyone you loved, what have you done*

*In the last eighteen years, 'sides being fucking dull?*

*You're a boy who lived, I'm the man who can't be named*

*I'm Slytherin, I'm slaughtering, my flow's untamed*

*They call me the Dark Lord, I own the world with my posse*

*You're a wizard Harry, or are you just a huge pussy?*

A huge fiery demon started emerging from the floor. Conjuration magic, the proof that Voldemort was confident. If Harry made a decent comeback, the spell could quite literally backfire. The fire demon started looking at Harry. So Harry picked up a mic, as he started, the beat started getting faster and faster.

*I kicked your ass while I was in diapers, just think about what I can do now*

*You think I peaked at three years old bro I'm about to take you down*

*Now I’m here in this courtyard and it's gonna be your last stand*

*I’m just the boy who lived, sure, but you’re the man who ran*

*From little baby Potter cause there was nothing you could do*

*Yellin Avada Kedavra!... And there’s nothing left of you*

*Yeah you've killed my family but I'm here with my gang*

*Our hobby? Putting assholes like you in Azkaban*

*But that place's too good for you so how 'bout this?*

*I'll make your head go "pop" with a little telekinesis*

*And "Dark Lord"? That wouldn't even be cool if you were thirteen*

*So edgy, is your nose compensating for something?*

*Killed you six times already, and I'm not even twenty*

*So here's a prophecy: you'll end up like your Nagini*

After the crowd went wild for a little while, everyone turned their attention to the fire demon, who would act as a referee for this first round. With its arms crossed, it looked at Harry, then at Voldemort, wondering what to do. Then, it looked back at Harry.

"Oh no", whispered Ron.

The demon charged at Harry, and disappeared in a huge explosion. After the smoke had cleared, the crowd saw Harry still standing, but badly hurt. He lost that round, and only managed to soften the damage he received by a bit. He needed to do much better next round, or Voldemort would win.

My first ever answer to a writing prompt, yay!

I had a lot of trouble polishing Harry's part, I might add round 2 if I manage to get it right.
