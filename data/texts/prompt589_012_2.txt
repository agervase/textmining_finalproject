With about 200 angels old enough to vote in the upcoming election there was a fervor never before seen.  Each generation of angels seems to grow according to the Fibonacci sequence.  So there are an increasing amount of choices this election cycle.  Every eligible angel voter is also eligible to be voted on.

But most importantly the issue of earth was always in vogue, and thoughts that maybe populating another planet would give something to do for the extra number of Angels.  

When the passing of the New Testament God on the crucifix, a surprise election was held and the vice God Alla was able to transition into the next election cycle.  Everyone had grown so tired of those intervening years that The Silent One (as he was called now) won the election for the next God. Now that Angels populated heavily the ones up for election were the old school angels who remembered Jesus, the new age people grew fascinated by science led by Tian, and the very active non-interventionist, Alex.  

Simone was well ahead in the lead, talking about the tweaks that should be tried, and really pushing another populating claiming Earth a success with hosts of angels living off of prayer these days.  Earth was even thinking of trying their own hand at populating.  

Tian wanted to create an Old-Testament style authority with one exception putting the scientific principles as the commandments.  Tian was raised by a very old school sect of angels.  Departing from their traditions by donning in on their own creations creation.  

Jesus as he was nicknamed, wanted a cabinet of angels to sacrifice themselves, they could avoid the tumultuous upheaval of circumstance if God stayed in office.  It was a risky premise a lot of people felt.
