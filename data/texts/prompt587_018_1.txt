I admired my father. He was a wise man, but when he tried to marry me to... ugh. I completely lost it. What had happened to the nice, “love anything your heart says you should” father? What has happened to “I’m proud of you. Choosing love before your career?” God. The decision of marry me to Jimmy sounded nothing like my father. And Jimmy! For god’s sake. He was like a brother to me when we were three and then became a super asshole when we got to high school. And why marry us? Because my dad, in his idiotic way to get over mom’s death, wanted to “satisfy” Jimmy’s mom. I know plenty of ways of satisfying woman and I’m hell as sure that marrying his kid isn’t one of them! 
So, even though he was my loving father once, I knew I had to leave.
I climbed out of the window, absolutely sure of my decision, absolutely fearless. After I found Jimmy’s mom climbing out of my dad’s window.
I waited for her in the garden. 
“You know, you could’ve gotten out by the door, it’s ok for me if you’re here” I told her when she reached the ground. Her mind was definitely somewhere else.  
“Honey, I’m sorry, but your father is an ass”
“Someone finally figured it out!” I smiled at her, happy because she didn’t seem to care that I was climbing out of my own house. “Well” I said breaking the silence so I wouldn’t give her a second to care about my wedding with his son ” I’m going to go now. I need... umh... I have stuff to do” I started running. Yeah, probably a stupid idea looking back to it. 
“Don’t go trough with the wedding” I heard her behind me. 
“I’m not going to!” I yelled, still running.
“Don’t go trough with crossing the street in the next five seconds!”
“What?!”
I remember the car. And the stupid look of Jimmy trough the glass scared of the outcome of the whole “Holy cow I’m running over my fiancé” situation.
Now I’m dead, asshole.
In retrospective... having her mom as mother-in-law was probably not so bad.
