No.

In the hero's eyes, I see the children before the stormtroopers during routine - come in, find someone in their village to make an example of, and end their life. Their eyes wet with fear, only beginning to harden.

No.

In the Emperor's eyes, I see my father begging for forgiveness, clear before the tears came and I swore on my life to avenge him.

No.

As he raises his sword and charges, I see myself. The Academy. The screaming sergeants bellowing to straighten up, swing your sword hard, teaching me all the places on a body that caused the most pain, how to lead, how to command, how to make yourself be feared with a sword or with a word. He moves like a recruit, moving in all the wrong ways.

No.

I see him swing. It is painless -  It has robbed me of the pain I had hoped to grant the Emperor a thousand fold. I know this because even the most "merciful" executions left the brain gasping in terror as a mouth desperately tried to take in air through a throat no longer there.

In the eyes of the rebels behind him are the lies I was told - by the "noble"men and women, their "soldiers", even their children.

That there was no such thing as "honor", save for gibbering weaklings who deserved to be trodden upon, to have their lands invaded, to have their women and children hanging from the gallows, to have their lives for *our* gain.

That there was no such thing as "morals", save for protecting your own and only your own, and taking what was *yours*.

That there was no such thing as "life", but *power*.

The lies I told *them* and the lies I began to tell myself.

No.

On his face, on their faces, I see myself, just a scared little boy sobbing as the Emperor's body falls to the ground.

No.

The way he raises his sword was the way I was taught at the academy.

No.

The way he bellows, the way he charges at me, the same way I had killed my first rebel, praying to the Gods that someone else would kill him, for I was on his side. His blade glints in the light, growing larger and larger.

No-
