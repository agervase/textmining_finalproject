“From the Bible. Yes.” I droned for the umpteenth time this week, handing him his freshly microwaved burger and fries, along with his lukewarm cola. 

It wasn’t too bad until I was forced by poverty to dawn this name-tag at this westernized burger joint. Restaurant? Stand? Do people say “joint” anymore? It’s so hard to keep track of, especially over 2,000 years of new lingo, technology, food, and don’t get me started on people. 

My social circle was pretty slim back in the day, most just me and my family. And the J-man, of course. However, after my dear sisters Mary and Martha passed on, I really withdrew myself for decades on end, longing to be reunited with them, but never feeling death’s warm, sweet embrace. They got their home in Heaven, but I was ripped from it, for what? A miracle? 

Bullshit. 

That miracle was the worst thing to happen to me. I’ve fallen so far since then. My faith is in shambles, my mind is so far behind everyone else’s, and there is no end in sight. But hey, I still look 30! The big G did give me that much. 

Fuck Him though. Tried for so many years to stay faithful, but then I realized my one prayer would never be answered. The One I had devoted my life to had forsaken me. 

I am so alone. My sisters faces washed from my memory by the persistent waves of time. The portraits of us made by the church are laughable. My memory may not be the greatest, but I can tell you for certain we were not white. Never know if I should chuckle or be enraged whenever I see their pitiful renditions. Maybe both. 

“Hey! I’ll have a number 12 with- Wait a minute. Lazarus? Like the dude from-“

“Yes, from the Bible,” I sighed deeply.
