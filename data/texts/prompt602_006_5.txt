Yeah yeah yeah, the one time they assign me a task it's in this dead place, what did I do to deserve this treatment, at first I was excited I'm finally going to direct a documentary am even allowed to be the script writer and then his words hit me "About earth"

But, sir why do we even need a documentary about this dead place - Said Junior.

We are the best documentary channel on alientube, our viewers rely on us to provide quality content, content that is unlike anything else in the galaxy, when our viewers ask us why we don't have any content about earth what do you expect me to tell them? and quite frankly we are running out of ideas so get to work now! - replied Senior. 

Junior left the office after he asked to take the rest of the day off so he can think about the huge task that he just received, writing a documentary about this crazy blue planet will not be an easy task it requires huge imagination everything in this planet is dangerous and try to kill you how can he write a documentary about it in a way that will be suitable for the audience, every thing about this planet is censored, even books about this planet are not widely available due to it containing insensitive material and now Junior is tasked to create a documentary about it and present it to the audience who tremble in fear when they hear words like traffic, losing, and fire  they consider things like hunting or picking vegetable in a not so nice way to be crimes against the galaxy, not only that but he is also supposed to go to the planet it self to take live footage, what is Junior going to do?

Nothing, replied Junior.

What do you mean - asked Senior.

I didn't do anything sir

But what are we going to show our audience today?

Nothing sir, we will tell them that there is nothing to show due to the censoring of the material that we have collected and it being not in lines with the galactic guidelines of sensible content we are forced to not show anything, we will then include a wise advice to anyone who even wants to know about earth saying

If you value honesty,

If you appreciate all forms of life,

and if you respect freedom of all creatures to live a dignified and happy life,

please don't seek to know anything about Earth, it will literately blow your mind.
