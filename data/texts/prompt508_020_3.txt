“How long has Pete been here, Hank?”

“Dogs! Bill, I don’t know. Do I look like the warden? Do I look like I sit on my cottontail all day reading files? I work for a living”

“Alright, alright. I figure seven or eight seasons. Old Sixer told me Pete was here a few seasons before he retired, and I’ve been a guard here since winter last…”

“Fences! He’s an old codger. I wouldn’t have guessed. I stay away from him if I can. He barely grooms, Bill. He’s a mess.”

“You’re right,” said Bill absently, talking around the carrot stump he always seemed to be chewing but never seemed to finish. “His fur is atrocious, he doesn’t gnaw enough to keep his teeth short, but he doesn’t smell.”

“Thank goodness for that, at least,” said Hank, with a twitch of his nose.

“It’s like he knows exactly how far to go to be left alone, and still avoid discipline. I’ll bet he’s never had a forced grooming.”

Both guards looked across the prison yard at the hard cases munching clover or hopping furtively into corners to whisper with friends. Bill spied Pete, dingy, matted fur making him stand out easily.

“Thing is, Hank, he doesn’t really look like an old codger. Not really. Under the grime, his whiskers are short and his ears still point straight up.”

Hank sat forward, really looking for the first time. “You know, Bill, you’re right. Maybe he’s not as old as he lets on. And, here’s another thing. Take a gander at his feet. That red clay they’re covered in, the only place in the yard you can find it is along the fence. What’s Pete in for?”

“He’s a killer, Hank. Three to his name.”

“Bad business, Bill. Well, nothing for it. We’ll just have to make sure we’re armed when we follow him tonight. I think we’ve got ourselves a digger.”

Late that night, Pete stood alone in the prison yard. He thumped one foot furtively, then swivelled his ears to listen. When he was satisfied there was no one coming he bent to shift the large stone covering the beginning of a burrow. There was a rustle as two guards hopped from the underbrush, one gnawing the stump of a carrot.

“Well well well, Bill, what have we here?”

“I think we have a case of illegal burrowing, Hank.”

“That we do, Bill. That we do. What do we expect that to tack on to old Pete’s sentence?”

“Another full season at least, Hank.”

The dirty rabbit looked at the guards, less fearfully than he should have. In fact, his nose twitched in amusement. “My name’s not Pete,” he said.

“Didn’t imagine it was, Petey old boy,” Bill replied jovially. “You know how many critters sign Peter at booking? Most common false name we get.”

“That and Mopsy, for some reason,” Hank added. “Listen, Pete, or whatever your name is, we can’t just let you burrow out of here. You’re a bad hare. Do you know what we do with bad hares?”

“I imagine you pluck them. Am I correct?” Pete said flatly. “And I wasn’t burrowing.”

“Sure looks like it, Mr. Cottontail.”

“Everyone who attempts an escape burrows,” Pete continued. “Wouldn’t it be smarter to do something different? Wouldn’t it be smarter to lure two guards, who are bound to have gate keys, to the very edge of the compound, in the middle of the night?”

“Sure it would Pete,” said Hank, “If those guards weren’t ready for you and armed with cudgels.” He leapt forward and grasped at Pete’s foreleg. He struggled, Pete didn’t, and when Hank pulled his paw back, he had scrubbed free a bit of dirt and grime, revealing…

Bill’s carrot thumped to the ground at his mouth fell open. “Pink fur! It can’t be! You’re...you’re...”

“Yes,” Pete said. “Yes, I am.”

“Foxes! Bloody foxes! I didn’t recognize him without the sunglasses!” Hank was the one caught now, unable to pull his paw free. “Run, Bill! We were wrong! He’s not just a killer! He’s...!

Hank trailed off as Pete closed with him. Bill was frozen with fright, mumbling to himself. “They say he’s unstoppable, that once he chooses a target, nothing keeps him from it. He doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, never gets old or run down. He just keeps going and going and going..."
