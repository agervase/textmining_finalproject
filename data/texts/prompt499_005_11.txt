"Mr. Pedigrew that's not how these things work" 

"yes I understand that but I only go see the ladies but once a week. Maybe more if the boys have something to celebrate. Surely that's not so bad?" 

"Have you ever read the Bible?" 

"Why yes of course I have." 

"All of it?" 

"I've read through the synoptic gospels. And I've read here and there bits of everything else. I go to church every week so I'm sure I've went over the whole Bible through my life I've been attending for over 40 years."

 "But front to cover have you ever read the whole thing?"

 "Probably. I read enough of it. One of these days I'll go through it all in one go." 

"Read the Holy Book. Before God damms you to hell."

 "I'm not the lawyer here you are. Why do I need to go through it all anyways?" 

"This isn't some  divorce or claims injury. We are talking about an eternity, your eternity."

 "I know. I know why do you think I came to see you. But this is all beside the point. Is my sin plan too much? Or can I spare to do some more?"

"It is only by faith in Christ we are saved."

 "Yes yes. I know that but I want to know if I will still go to heaven after going to the club once a week for the reminder of my life."

 "That's not how it works Mr. Judas Thomas Pedigrew!" 

"Well then how does it work?"

 "I've already explained it to you." *then he takes a great sigh* "Read the book. Then you'll understand. The rules of who goes to heaven and hell are clear, definite, and inarguable. Just read it and you'll understand. It's not about how much you sin or if this much sin is allowed or not. It is about faith, belief, or in other words trust."  "And quit calling me your lawyer I'm a preacher not your lawyer."
