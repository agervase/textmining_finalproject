"Yeah but that means I wouldn't have died then."

It's honestly my luck.  To die, number 100k - and told that before my heart is placed on the scales of justice one negative karmic decision can be undone.

Just one.

"Yeah you're not understanding.  I wouldn't have died if I went to Wendy's instead."

YOU CAN NOT PUT ONE WHO RESIDES AROUND THE HOLY OF HOLIEST IN CONSTANT WORSHIP TO THE TEST OF PARADOX.

"As above so below."  Yeah.  That was muttered.  See, if you knew me - you'd know that my company business side-job is the "import of cannabis seeds" - "As above, Sow Below."  One problem.  I'm horrible at business.   I'm really good at reading and watching Youtube.  So decided to start practicing alchemy.  Honestly living the lifestyle.  Ultimately my brain was fried in a circular loop of what is polarity and where does polarity exist everywhere if not anywhere.  Dropped out.  Plugged in.  Tuned out.  Found the tone.  Felt as if the powers of the ALL were given to me now the afterlife must be described yet not be the emotional heart-string.

"To go to Wendy's instead."

&#x200B;

YOU CAN NOT STATE THAT ANSWER.

"I just did.  There's literally 19,000 universes now where that exists."

&#x200B;

YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.  YOUR HUMAN MIND IS CONCEIVING DEATH HOW IT WISHES.  ONE CAN NOT COMPREHEND WHAT IS HAPPENING."

&#x200B;

"But I do."  I do understand.   "Why can't you accept the answer?"

Silence.

"Is someone telling you what to do - wait a minute - "

There's a small line of smoke rising - there's a cigarette in my hand.

"I can manifest anything you just said so."

&#x200B;

ONE CAN NOT COMPREHEND.

&#x200B;

"Yet it's what I'm... experiencing.  I can do anything."

STATE YOUR ANSWER.

Suddenly my feet are off the floor and I'm wearing my favorite outfit; sexual urges fill my mind as the entire process of getting ready for the night washes over me in a single thought.

"What if I don't answer?"

&#x200B;

Silence.

&#x200B;

The cigarette taste just as cancer causing as reality.

&#x200B;

What if I want to manifest Wendy's.

&#x200B;

The room changes into a familiar scene just an hour ago.  The living room before getting in the car.

&#x200B;

"Eat Eat, Da Da?"  My two year old son shakes his cookie in my face.  "Eat Da Eat Da!"

"Your pregnant wife is craving chicken nuggets."  I grab my son and fall into my wife and start crying.

&#x200B;

"It's ok.. hey."  Marriage sometimes pauses those long physical touchings so it felt... reassuring.  Pure joy.  Life restored.  "I still want nuggets though."  She pulled back and smiled and said, "He looks just like you."  My son and his curly hair nestled against my shoulder.

&#x200B;

"The nuggets are on sale at Wendy's."  I lied.

"But I like the other ones!"  She teases back.

"How about you drive, instead?"

&#x200B;

I hand her the keys.
