"Alright, so how are we gonna do this?"

Grola looked to the group. He noticed that they were still relaxing and taking the time to enjoy themselves.

Expecting an answer, he repeated. "How are we gonna do this?"

Reft looked at Grola and said, "We're waiting for Nate."

"Nate?! The human?! He'll get us killed!"

Just then, another member of the group, Kwoac, irritatedly looked to Grola. "We won't die, but he will. We've been over this. Now sit down and shut up before he-"

"Hey, guys."

Everyone in the room shut up and looked to the door. He looked so off. Out of place. Humans were somewhat new to the whole area, so having someone not scaly or furry in the group was odd, not to mention dangerous. Humans were known to kill for odd reasons, after all.

"So, how will we do this?" asked Nate.

The strategist, Yotuc, looked to the board. Not electronic, untraceable.

"So, me and Grola will go in through the top of the building via the air vents. Nate will go in, be the distraction for the guards. Don't shoot until shit goes wrong." He looked to Nate. "*Got it?*

"Well, what if I was a distraction by maybe... shooting the security cameras so they don't see our faces? Or anything they can use to identify us?"

"*NO.*" Yotuc turned back to the board and ran his claws against another part of the diagram. "Kwoak, you and Trowyan will go in through this side of the building, towards the safes. You will then be given the drills by me and Grola. Nate's distraction should be going strong by that point, and we'll get out Scott free. Of course, all of this assumes that the corruption software worked correctly on the cameras. So, in short, you shouldn't need to shoot them. Reft, you make sure that the camo works on the crew going in to drop the drill. We could only afford two, so they better fucking work. When you've done that, make sure our vehicles are prepared."

"Any questions?"

Silence.

"Okay. Let's roll!"

Everyone grabbed their rifles and headed to the bank in different cars.

"N, everything going fine?"

"Perfect. Nothing out of the ordinary. Everything fine there, Y?"

"Yep. K?"

"Doing fine. Waiting on you."

Nate looked around the lobby. Creatures moving through, depositing or withdrawing credits. 

Out of the corner of his eye, Nate spotted a red light.

"Guys. Cameras are on. Cameras are fucking on."

"What?"

"You deaf, T? The fucking cameras are on."

"Well, what do we do?"

Just then, Nate got an idea.

"Hang tight. I've got an idea."

Everyone switched voice channels and got ready for Nate's untimely demise.

"There we go. The human will die, and we'll get the money."

"Can't believe he bought that! Great thinking, K."

Kwoak giggled and her scales changed to pink, indicating happiness.

Meanwhile, Nate had grabbed his rifle and his mask. He ran into the lobby, took aim at the ceiling, and got ready.

"3... 2..."

"HE'S GOT A GUN!"

"...1."

*TWELVE DAYS LATER*

"How the fuck is he still alive?"

"Kwoak, we got the money."

"Yeah, we did, Grola." Kwoak then shoved Grola, disturbing his fur as he fell off of the sofa. "But let me remind you, WE COULD'VE GOTTEN MORE CREDITS IF HE DIED."

"Kwoak, relax."

Yotuc entered the room and drank some whiskey. If there was one thing he could thank humans for, it was that.

"We got the money. And also, Nate happens to have completely wiped our profiles from the police database. Humans are very intelligent when it comes to technology, wouldn't you agree?"

Trowyan finally spoke up. "Yeah, at least we got some money. Most people would kill for the amount we each got. Plus, I actually think that human's a good friend. Got to know him a bit better over the past few days. Real nice kid."

Yotuc nodded, as did Grola, who then said, "I thought he was a liability, but he got us out of there. Kept in touch. Really into those games of his."

"Reft? What about you?"

"Fucking adore him."

Kwoak, obviously frustrated, said, "Am I the only one who thinks he should've died?"

The group responded in unison, "Yep."

Across town, Nate was playing some games, getting ready to attack an enemy base with friends.

As the plan was executed, Nate smirked.

"Hang on, guys. I've got an idea."
