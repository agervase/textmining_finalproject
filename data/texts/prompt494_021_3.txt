*"You don't want to go."*

"Of course I don't want to go! I want to live! I'm only twenty-five!"

*"It's very easy and gentle. Trust me, you'll like it."*

"I don't care if it's Cloud Nine with sixteen sex symbols and an all you can eat buffet! NOT GOING."

*"So, you resist?"*

"Yes."

*"You really resist?"*

"Yes!"

*"One last time. You're resisting your death and refuse to go."*

"YES! Leave me ALONE!"

*"Thank you. I'll be going now."*

The scythe swung down, and Jimmy cringed as the blade glittered, eager to reap his sou-

Death had left the building, and the scythe was in his hands. His very, very, bony hands. And black robe. Why was he? What? Who?

**"Your next collection is thirty-two miles away."**, said Something from within the scythe. For an otherworldly voice from the abyss, it apparently had a GPS function.

The urge to send someone to their eternal reward grew from nothing, a craving, a hunger, an addiction that felt as if it had waited an entire lifetime to be fed roared to life. Reaping was the most natural thing in the world. Like breathing. Except Jimmy wasn't needing to do that anymore. But Jimmy did need to take care of that poor fellow caught in the wood chipper...

When Death comes, there are only two. The reaper, and the reaped. Truly and wholly refuse to die when Death arrives?  Then Death may find peace, and you shall take their place until another refuses in return. So it has been since the first, and the first billion, and so on, and so forth until the last life will look upon the world and peacefully pass from it, leaving the last Death to look upon his field and see that it is barren.

But we have a long way to go to that. And a lot of Deaths. But only the one scythe.
