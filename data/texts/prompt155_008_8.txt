*Room 332. When I got on the third floor, I asked a nurse where was Room 332. She pointed to the hallway on my right and said its on the end of the corridor. After walking a bit, I found Room 332. I then sat on the cold metallic seat and waited. A nurse then got out.*

"Excuse me, are you Alana Wright? Your boyfriend's awake." The nurse said.

*I immediately went in and I saw him. His skin looked yellow and he was weak. A bag by the side of his bed had some dark liquid. He turned his head and when he saw me, he smiled.*

**"**Alana," he said. "Come here.**"**

*"Yeah babe?" I said.*

**"**Do you remember all those days when we first met at the shop? I'm going to tell you a story that has been eating at me for a while. It may sound crazy, but I want you to just believe me. No matter how weird you think it is. Okay?**"** He asked.

*"Sure," I said. "What is it about?" I asked.*

**"**It began when on a Monday evening, I went home from work. I was super tired and I just couldn't be bothered. The house was always dark, so I always had a light on no matter the time. I then took off my shoes, my socks, my tie, and went to the bedroom to rest.

Suddenly, the roof creaked as if something is walking on it. I thought it was just some rats and so I didn't care. It was quite an old house anyway, and so I didn't care. As I laid there, my phone rang. I pulled it out of his pocket and it was Sharon. 

"Hey Henry! I need you to cover for me tomorrow. I'm currently sick and I need you to do it. Alright?" she said.

"Uh I can-" I was about to say that I can't when she cut me off.

"Fantastic! Thank you so much Henry!" Sharon replied, immediately hanging up.

She was always like that. She always had a ton of excuses to give just to skip work. Even though she said she was sick, she's probably just relaxing at home with her boyfriend or something, leaving me to cover her, and so I always do double the work. I then fell asleep. I was suddenly awoken from my sleep when I heard the wood creaking again. It sounded as if it was coming from the attic. I thought that it was rats again, until it happened again. Half asleep, I decided to investigate. So I got up, picked up a shoe, and went up into the attic. I opened the attic door, and climbed up the stairs. I then turned on the light and found that there was nothing there. It was the rats. I then turned around when I heard this voice.

"Henry", a soft female voice whispered. 

I turned around, and saw a woman standing right in front of me. Probably just a few feet away. I was shocked and I screamed, thinking they were robbers or something. I was just about to run when I noticed that now the attic was empty, there were no stairs, no door. I panicked. I looked back and now I saw six more figures.**"**

*"A woman? Six more figures?" I interrupted.*

**"**As I said, just believe me for a second.

"Please do not scream. We're not going to harm you." the woman said.

When I heard her voice, it had seemed so unreal. As if I was dreaming.

"Who are you?" I asked.

"My name is Pride. The woman to my left is called Lust, and the man to the right of me is called Wrath", the figure on the left of her responded. He was muscular, handsome, and his silky smooth baritone voice projected this sense of respect.

Now I was never the religious type. I was raised in a Catholic family, but after my parents died I stopped believing.

"Wait a minute, Wrath? Pride? Lust? The seven deadly sins? I must be dreaming," I said. It was so unreal.

"When you first came here five days ago, we tried to stay silent. Ever since we lived here we always stayed silent. But when you came, we can't stay silent. You were always unfortunate, and you seem so.....lifeless. And we couldn't bear to see you like that. We know about work and Alana. We just....wanted to help you." Lust said.

Then I asked how did she knew about work and you. And the male figure on her left said that they often checked on me because they were worried, except for one, Sloth, who stayed.

"Whatever you do, please know that we are here now." she said. A really bright light then hit me and I was blinded. I couldn't see anything. I then woke up, sweating. I checked my phone. It said that it was 4.30 AM. I looked around. It was all a dream, I thought. It was just some work stress or something. Suddenly I heard a voice. "No it ain't", it said.

I looked over to my left, to a chair, and I saw this figure. He was a bit chubby. He was bald. He looked a bit like old John.

"I'm Gluttony." the man responded.

"I'm turning crazy. I'm definitely turning crazy." I thought to myself.

"No you ain't. We're all real and we're all worried about you." he responded.

"The hell? You can read my mind? How?" I asked.

"We're supernatural. We can do anything. Oh yeah, I forgot, I got something for you. It's in the kitchen if you want." the man said.

Of course I was confused. What was in the kitchen? Maybe I am losing my mind and I was in denial. But I was curious, and so I got up and walked to the kitchen. The man walked along with me. When I got there, I saw this big plate with a fish steak and some red wine. I was flattered and he told me to eat it.

"I was going to eat it, but I thought it'll be better for you to eat it. Your saving has made you famished." he said.

I asked from where did he get said steak, but he said that I shouldn't worry and I should just eat it. As I was eating it, I can see from my peripheral that he's staring as if he was transfixed by the steak. Every time I looked up, he would turn his gaze, but I knew he wanted this so bad. But he was that kind to let me eat it instead. It was so good. I haven't eaten in a while because I was trying to save money.

A few hours later, I went to work. As I was cataloging the items in the storage room, I heard someone come in. It was about 8 in the morning, and so it shouldn't be a customer. But I was just trying to do Sharon's work as fast as possible so I can focus on mine. Then the storage room door opened and someone asked me where Sharon was. I said that she was sick and I was covering for her. It was you. You were searching for her for something, I forgot, but at the time I wasn't confident enough.**"**

*"It was a technical thing, the cash register can't detect the barcodes."*

**"**Oh right. But anyways, you then left. As you close the door, Pride showed up.

"The fuck you doing man? She needs help, help her! You know about computers and stuff don't you? Help her then!". He said it with such pride. It was almost narcissistic.

I said that while I do know it, I wasn't brave enough. I can't do it. You were so beautiful, and I just don't feel that you were worthy of me. He shouted at me that I am the most handsome individual on this earth and that I am worthy of you. I should get out there and help you. 

And then Lust showed up too, and gave me the same shouting. I collected my mind, and I got out and asked you what the problem was. And then you said-**"**

*"Yeah yeah, I said that it was nothing but you persisted. And you actually fixed it. It was wonderful."*

**"**I know. After that when I came back to the storage room I was so happy that I did that. Pride and Lust looked so happy with me finally cracking a smile. They then disappeared."

*"When they appeared and disappeared, did they have like a smoke or something like in the movies?"*

**"**No, they were just...there. No smoke no nothing. One second its nothing then you blink and there they were. But anyway. When I got home, Sharon called me again and asked whether or not I did her cataloging or not. I said I did and she was satisfied.
