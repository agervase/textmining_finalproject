Third night in a row and she's shrieking, now. Loud, piercing, past the cottonball fluff earplugs ripped from her mattress, over Sinatra gleefully belting to the world from the old iPod radio combo like nothing was wrong in the world and that the blood wasn't leaking under the fucking door.

Jane heard that scream, once. Danny wanted to be a gymnast, and she was proud of herself for making the team that had Olympic dreams. Danny wasn't so proud when she hit the padding wrong and the bone tore itself clean, hammered through the skin.

Jane had issues with loud, shrill things after that. The fire alarm had to go. The sirens, too. All types - the cops, the fire engines, the EBS, the get-the-fuck-out-of-the-city-now sirens.

The last one was the worst. Last they went off was when she had visited Danny's general doctor, who looked so much older under a clean suit, resting as much as he could over the corpse of Danny's classmate, who had her skull taken clean off by a big-ass rifle round that Jane would later know was her deep-red-come-and-get-it-liberal neighbor's very illegal explosive rounds. Danny's general doctor gave this deep sigh that crinkled out of God-knew-how-many-filters from his mask.

"It's not like Hollywood," he said, one of his favorite lines, typical no-fun-having realism-everything folk who got supremely annoyed when Jane's shift manager quoted Scrubs at him. "The first day, you're thinking that bite isn't so bad. The next, you're chewing the face off your dad and thinking it's a hug all the time."

He was wrong on it not being like Hollywood. All the zombies, the ones with parasites growing out of their heads, the walking fungus, the idiots stumbling around, the ones who sprinted like her uncle trying out for the Olympics, she could take care of easily.

But her daughter's screaming and crying, at the top of her lungs, and sure enough, so is Jane.
