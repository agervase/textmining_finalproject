Today I turned 41. Of course in this golden age of humanity where one can continue his or her life indefinitely, that number is meaningless.

My mother was the leading pharmacologic on the Carbon Renewal project, a procedure meant to cure patients with muscular dystrophy. She had taken a the position shortly after my birth. I was born with muscular dystrophy. I wasn't supposed to live for more than a few months, but out of sheer luck I survived.

I remember when I was 9 or 10 when she had a breakthrough in her research.  Experimental testing had shown that not only had muscles had regenerated, but the subject was no longer showing signs of aging. I was going to be stuck in a prepubescent body for the remainder of my life.

From that point on, Mom was completely consumed by her work. I rarely saw her. The only times I did were in a cold metallic hospital room so she could study my growth, or lack thereof.

Highschool was tough. I was bullied a lot because of my size. Imagine mentally maturing while your body failed to do so. I dreaded presenting in front of the class; my eager-for-puberty body would get random erections without warning. They called me Boner Boy. I couldn't talk to my mom about what was going on because she was too busy planning the mass-production of her miracle drug treatment. I couldn't defend myself either, a 10 year old boy isn't very threatening.

I decided I would focus on expanding my mind and excelling in school. I got my PhD in toxicology from Harvard, valedictorian. 

I've dedicated my life to finding a cure to the unaging symptoms caused by my mothers drug. 20 years I have spent unsuccessful, the torment of others weighing down on me and hindering my research. 

I fear there is only one final solution. Too bad you must be at least 21 years old to purchase a gun.
