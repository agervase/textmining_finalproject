Slim,  
"It started with a molten ball,  
Slowly cooled off then explosions fall,   
As astroids deployed to open scars,"  
Aliens,  
"But what about the stolen cars,  
The war torn countries born and broken shards,   
Of humanity full of insanity and show boat stars?"  
Slim,  
"Shut up bitch and sit and let me spit,  
Its only a matter of time,  
before im rappin some lines about some better shit,  
As i was sayin, there was somethin the planet was missin,  
Another planet and its damage collision,  
Sent everything dancin and spinnin,  
The doom we soon saw as the moon and it invisioned,  
Tides multiplied lands divided chemicals mixed,  
the right circumstances provide individual hints,  
Of cells emerging giving life a chance,  
Yes it was nice for plants and life had plans,  
Aliens,  
"But what about all the wife and man,  
Howd that come about in lifes plan thats grand,  
What of the nukes the guns that shoot and militaries,  
The stuff that dug and stuffed all your cemetaries,"  
Slim,  
"Shut the fuck up i told you not to interrupt!,  
Do that shit again and ill begin ta cut,  
Your throats till you choke on your green blood!,  
As i was sayin,  plants and mammals,  
Reptiles fish and ample,  
Kinds of living things were roamin the lands,  
Complexity gave creatures the ability to open their hands,  
All was great even had some walkin apes,  
Started grunting n shit, eventually talkin hate,  
Watergate deception politicians that all was fake,  
All n all we  did okay enough to walk in space,"   
Aliens,   
"What about the..."  
Slim,   
"Fuck this shit you fuckin green bastards..."  
Slim grabs the nearest laser power saber and begins mutilating the alien visitors.  
Slim,   
" you were suppose to listen to me,  
Now bleed bitch bleed,  
Now bleed bitch blleeeeeeddddd!!!!,  
Soooo longggg,  
Aliens are now gonnnneeee,  
I dont want to make a sonnggg,   
To explain earth to yooouuuuu"  
Slim kneels down while shaking his head. "Couldnt shut up, and ended like Kim." He then flicks the corpses off and kicks the bodies off the dock into the water. He gently raises the hood of his hoody and slides his hands in his pockets, as he walks off into the distance.
