>[TRACK LISTING: [DOOMFIST THEME (OVERWATCH SOUNDTRACK OST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FywheYwJvQ)]

*[Scene: INT. ADAWE INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NUMBANI ATTACK SPAWN. Rubble clears, revealing (SIDE SHOT) the shadowed outline of a mangled OR15 defense unit. MATCH CUT to REVERSE SHOT of Akande Ogundimu, displaying the Doomfist gauntlet in the "heroic" position. DOOMFIST grins wickedly.]* 

DOOMFIST: Time to take back what is rightfully mine.  

TRACER: [Offscreen] Not if I have anything to say about it!

*[Cue PAN SHOT towards airport entrance, right of Doomfist's position. TRACER stands by the stairs, guns ready.]*

TRACER: You're going right back to the pit you came from. [Cocks guns] Hands where I can see 'em, big guy.

DOOMFIST: Oh, you want a closer look?

*[Doomfist charges, gauntlet first, toward Tracer. A split second before contact, Tracer recalls, leaving Doomfist hurtling through thin air. A moment later, she reappears, and fires a volley of ammo into Doomfist's right side. OVERHEAD SHOT of Tracer and Doomfist zipping back and forth across the terminal (approx. 10 seconds). CUT to Doomfist, centered in the room as Tracer continues to move around him.]*

DOOMFIST: You are keeping your distance. That's good. You've learned from our last encounter. [Shields face with gauntlet] You may not believe in the virtues of my agenda, but it drives you all the same. You've had practice.

TRACER: [Firing] And how much practice have you 'ad? [Blinks twice, fires again] Have fun punchin' walls all day?

*[Doomfist lunges. Tracer sidesteps him and fires into his back as he passes.]*

DOOMFIST: [Rising] As much as you've learned while I'm away, there is no stopping what I am about to do. I beat you once. I can do it again. [Charges gauntlet]

*[***ABRUPT SMASH CUT** *to WIDE SHOT, revealing ADAM CONOVER sitting atop an overturned tandem sling chair, eating an airport pretzel.]*

ADAM: [Bemused] *Can* you, though?

TRACER: [Aggravated] Oh, no.

DOOMFIST: [Recoiling] *What in the ever-living* [bleep]—

ADAM: [Standing, throwing aside pretzel] Let's be honest. You're a big dude with a bigger fist. Points for presentation. But beneath that armored trunk of an arm lies a *laundry list* of technical problems, that even the futuristic technology of the Overwatch universe would never be able to solve. [JUMP CUT to Adam facing camera directly] Hi, I'm Adam Conover, and this is *Adam Ruins Everything*.

*[INTRO to ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING]*
>[TRACK LISTING: [ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING - THEME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUBvhQhaYoI)]

*[WIPE to Adam, desperately defending himself as Tracer claws at his face in double time.]*

TRACER: *Bloody WANKER ain't I told you to stay OUT of Overwatch business swear on me MUM I'll feed you to ROADHOG—*

*[Doomfist picks up Tracer by her jacket. Tracer continues lunging at Adam.]* 

DOOMFIST: Would you mind explaining just *who exactly* you're supposed to be?

ADAM: I just did. [JUMP CUT as Adam pops up from the ground, seemingly unharmed.] But let's take a second and talk about who exactly *you're* supposed to be.

*[TRACKING SHOT moves laterally STAGE LEFT and FADES to Scene: INT. MARTIAL ARTS ARENA - NIGERIA, AFRICA as YOUNG AKANDE strides across foreground in Dambe fighting stance.]*

ADAM: [Voiceover] Poor Akande was cut down in the prime of his fighting career during the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis. But what sealed the deal wasn't the loss of his entire right arm. It was the introduction of his new arm, which used cybernetic technology developed by the company he inherited from his father.

*[SWISH PAN to Young Akande standing before a council of three West African martial arts officials. Another match continues in the background.]*

HEAD OFFICIAL: The board has ruled that your recent enhancements give you an unfair advantage over other contestants. We are sorry to say that you will not be eligible for this year's competition. [Clears throat] That being said, we would always appreciate another sponsor—

*[PAN UPWARDS to reveal Adam, Doomfist, and Tracer sitting on nearby bleachers. Tracer is cheering on the fighters on the stage below, waving an [oversized foam Doomfist gauntlet](http://i.imgur.com/dgRBdww.jpg) which is fitted awkwardly over the gun holsters on her forearms.]*

DOOMFIST: How on earth did we get here? Is that *me?*

ADAM: Now let's be fair: we've made a lot of great strides in prosthetic technology in the past decade. And given that the Omnic Crisis began in 2046, it's safe to say we'll have made plenty more by the time that arm gets hacked off by raging Terminators.

*[Tracer realizes what she is doing as Adam speaks and tears off the foam gauntlet, disgusted.]*

ADAM: But that's not enough to overcome your worst nemesis.

DOOMFIST: Winston?

ADAM: *Gravity.*

*[IRIS OUT to footage of CAVIAR BLUE modeling the [Official Doomfist Cosplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4yl3h1SBS8) for the San Diego Comic Con 2017.]*

ADAM: [Voiceover] Just think: Blizzard's official cosplay alone was made out of sixty different pieces! All together, the gauntlet weighs more than fifteen pounds. And most of that is 3D printed plastic.

>Source: https://mic.com/articles/182766/overwatch-doomfist-how-the-amazing-official-cosplay-from-comic-con-came-to-life#.BOemENHvk

ADAM: [continuing] But for the Doomfist to really work, it would have to be made of some high-quality materials, and that drives the weight *way* up. And for a dude who just lost a limb, [inhales through teeth, grimacing] that's a little more than you can bench.

*[CUT to Doomfist and Tracer]*

DOOMFIST: [To Tracer] Is he being serious?

TRACER: [Grumbling] I hate him *so much,* you have *absolutely* no idea...

DOOMFIST: [To Adam (PAN STAGE RIGHT, MEDIUM SPEED)] You must not be familiar with the advancements in energy storage my company has made. Or the world, for that matter. The Doomfist does not rely on human strength alone.

ADAM: Doesn't matter. No matter what power source you're using, for a fist of that size, electricity is a whole other problem.

*[Infographic of Doomfist with a normal sized arm.]*

ADAM: [Voiceover] Your average everyday prosthetic limb has lots of options for where it gets its power. The simplest ones will be controlled by your muscles, either directly or through *myoelectricity*, which is the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. [Infographic reflects the installation of new prosthetic arm as Adam speaks.] But since you lost your *whole* arm, you need a couple more parts: biosensors, a controller, and an actuator, which is actually just a fancy word for a motor. [Infographic adds the Doomfist gauntlet] Your gauntlet is so heavy, the power it would take to control it would be close to what it takes to power a dirtbike, or even a full-sized electric car. [Infographic shows Doomfist weighed down by gauntlet until he collapses.]

*[CUT to Doomfist and Adam]*

DOOMFIST: And this power source would obviously be held within the gauntlet, correct?

ADAM: Not unless scientists found a way to break the First Law of Thermodynamics. Energy can't be created or destroyed, only transferred. It's all coming from somewhere, and getting drained fast. That's not to mention your Hand Cannon. Any battery powerful enough to keep all that equipment charged would release energy in the form of heat, burning your skin off anytime you tried to pull off a sweet combo. So, since you obviously can't keep the Doomfist wired up to a car battery all the time, that energy would have to come from *you.*

DOOMFIST: This is getting ridiculous.

ADAM: You would have to eat a *ton* of calories to keep the gauntlet running. More than you could eat in a week, or even a month. And every moment you're not eating, the gauntlet is sapping away what's left of your natural strength, like a mechanical vampire. In short, the Doomfist is too heavy to actually be useful.

*[WIPE STAGE LEFT back to Scene: INT. ADAWE INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NUMBANI ATTACK SPAWN. Doomfist is holding Tracer by the jacket again.]*

DOOMFIST: What is the point of this... loquacious charade? I am still here. A video game does not have to bend to the laws of normal physics. Your words mean *nothing!*

TRACER: [Mumbling] Lemme at 'im, just lemme take a pop at 'is smug face...

ADAM: Hey, I'm sure my words affected you more than you know.

DOOMFIST: And how's that?

ADAM: They distracted you, of course!

*[Doomfist whips around to see GENJI SHIMADA aiming for the exposed skin along the side of the gauntlet. Electricity crackles as the metal opens outward like the lid of a tin can. Doomfist falls to his knees as Genji continues to disable him.]*

ADAM: I could talk about this guy's enhancements, but then I'd basically be repeating myself.

*[Genji glares at Adam before exiting with Doomfist. The gauntlet is left on the floor. Tracer picks it up.]*

ADAM: Well, looks like my work here is done! We make a great team, don't we, Tracer?

TRACER: Get stuffed. [Hoists gauntlet over her shoulder.] My boss is gonna want to see you now. Seein' as how this is the third time this month you've gone on and wrecked a crime scene.

ADAM: Your boss?

*[Enter WINSTON, a glasses-wearing ~~gorilla~~ scientist equipped with metal armor, a small jetpack, and a gun that shoots electricity.]*

WINSTON: Hi there.

ADAM: [whispering] *Hello, multi-season contract.*
