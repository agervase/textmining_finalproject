"Oh-ho!" said Death, staring at me in shock, "You have beaten me!"

The sexy idiot was right. He seemed not to know what to say.

"I don't know what to say!" he said.

We had been locked in chess combat for nearly a day, holed up in a tiny room that smelled like a butt. Death had taken to punching himself in the face at every piece he lost and he'd come to resemble a bruised Skeletor. "You look like a bruised Skeletor," I said. That was kind of dumb of me though because then he started to whip me with his belt and it sucked. "Ow." I said. And I meant it.

"I don't know what to dooooo!!" wailed Death as he whipped me mercilessly, tears streaming down his face. "Wahhhh I'm so saaaadddddd!!!" 

I chuckled as blood poured from the welts on my back. Death was a fool, and I the fool-tamer. 

Just then, the police showed up. It was Robocop and he looked awesome. He was all shiny and the police lights reflected on him and it was awesome. I was like oh man this is friggin' sweet. And it definitely was totally friggin' sweet because Robocop just started like totally pistol-whipping Death, like in the face and everything. Death was all like "oh nooooo!" and I just laughed because it was awesome.

After that, Robocop gave me a ride in his police car and it was super fast and he turned on the sirens and everybody was so jealous and they wished they were me. Then we got to my house and Robocop punched Kenny and my mom saw what a wuss he is and she fell in love with Robocop instead and they got married and now Robocop is my dad and it's awesome.

~THE END~
