*Take your time reading this to her.*















As she purred while he scratched her chin, David rocked in his chair at the window gently caressing Mits, enveloped in the few rays of sunshine that permeated the window warming them both, a thankful respite from the coolness of winter around them. Mits was huddled in an impossibly little ball on David's lap, savoring the sweet warmth, and lightly flicking its tail every now and then. David couldn't help but smile. Mits had become quite a big cat since he and Josephine adopted her a few years ago, yet at times like this she would still seem a kitten, their little Mits. 

He felt something stir behind him, and turned in time to see Josephine quietly walk into the hallway from their room, groggy from her nap. She saw them, and her lips turned into a sleepy smile while she stretched. David went still for a second, and appreciated her beauty. She was wearing nothing but a vastly oversized t-shirt and heavy white socks, and her dirty blonde hair fell heavily on her shoulders and across her face, melting his heart. She walked towards them, with slow, graceful strides, accentuated, instead of faulted, by her grogginess, and careful sat on her heels, facing him. "Hi", she whispered, smiling. Her eyes were honey, and turned to gold as the sun illuminated them under her long lashes. Some of her hair had matted on the side of her face, reaching all the way down to the side of her full lips, slightly cracked from the coldness of the season. She had some tiny little scars and dots on her face, and her cheeks glowed ever so slightly with pink. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. 

He felt himself smile, and let himself kiss her.
