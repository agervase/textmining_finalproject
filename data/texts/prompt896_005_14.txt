That was my last day on school before graduation. My class's grades were ready that very morning, but the rest of school were preparing their final tests for that week. The library was full and live.

I stepped in while carrying a pille of books. I found that most math books were only worth for its excercises rather than their raw knowledge, but also they weren't a big deal neither. That old McGraw Hill was more a dead weight in my hands than nothing. On top of it, two little books were lying without carrying much attention: a rather grey-colored book named *The Complete Works of H.P Lovecraft* and a worn-out one called *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* in blue and white.

*Don't panic,* I thought. Those two books gave more days and days of joy and insight, returning them seemed very wrong to me, but I needed to do so. I don't remember why, but I thought that giving a chuckle or a small grin to the old librarian could be nice in the middle of those days of stress and work.

Then, before entering the queue I took a yellow request card and wrote:

* Title: *The Necronomicon*
* Autor: ~~*Howard Ph-*~~

No. I frowned and erased that last part. What was his name? Abdul... Akbar? No, no, no. I took my phone and I did a quick search. *Alhazred.*

* Title: *The Necronomicon*
* Autor: *Abdul Alhazred*
* Publication date: c.a 730

*I'm so smart*, I thought naively and smiled. I would never guessed that it was the first time that I truly smiled.

**********

"You want *what*? Are you sure?" the old librarian said and raised an eyebrow. He already had took the other books when he saw the request card. "Kid, don't waste my time."

"Could you at least do a quick search in the database, Mr. Armitage?"

"No way. I can't do that."

Then he took the books and started scanning them. He chuckled when the barcode showed the Lovecraft book on his computer screen. I tried to maintain a serious face, but I smiled too.

"We have a few normal *Necronomicons*, here and there. Don't ya want one?"

Then I said it.

"You were the master librarian of the Miskatonic University. You can find it. You can find every book in the world."

Joke finished. Bad punchline.

Then the old man sweated. I was expecting a little laugh, but his expression was pure horror.

"Lower your voice, kiddo." he replied. "You know... things. Meet me in the history section aisle."

I was confused. He was *that* Armitage? I meant to only do a joke.

However, I played along with him. At first I tought he would give me and old edition of the book, or perhaps a rare antology of Lovecraft. It was known that the old man spent a lot of time reading and collecting books, 
strengthening the stereotype of librarian book worms.

I was distracted reading some titles on the aisle when ten minutes later I felt his cold hand on my shoulder.

"My father, Henry Armitage, entrusted me *this* copy. It has lost his power long ago... But you knew things. You have potential..."

I was spechless. He had and old worn-out book made of leather with strapes closing it. It seemed... cold.

"Listen kiddo, I don't want you bothering me with this again. Show me you worth it and we shall see."

He handed me the grimoire. It was heavy and cold. The leather was... as I suspected, human.

"However, cannot lend it to you forever... And you better know old arabic."

I felt how my hands tried to seize the freezing aura and failed. Its weight was replaced with the pressure of my hands griping it.

"Due back in three weeks."
