-Yo, good morning Todd.

-Good morning Chad. How was your night? 

-Pretty awesome if you ask me man! Both of the girls stayed up all night “if you know what i mean”!

-This is all very good Chad but i have to remind you that we leave today, probably for a long time are you sure you don’t want to say goodbye to your family? 

-Yes i’m sure man, besides everyone thinks i’m just a stupid jock and they were the ones that distanced themselves! I couldn’t care less! 

-Alright alright no need to agitate yourself, let me put the finishing touches here and off we go. 

25 January 1998, 20 years ago.

The year had started awful, all the expectations from the new years eve party destroyed by life, my parents divorced, my sister crippled from a drunk driver. Fired from my job due to company budget cuts. That night came and i was reading for the hundredth time the ingredients the drawings everything to make sure i didn’t do a mistake. I fell in a dried up well two weeks ago in the middle of nowhere and broke my left hand and my right leg, as i was searching around with my cell i saw a carved stone and with little effort it cane loose. Behind it there was a cavity that had a cloth wrapped around a book. I took it out discarded the cloth and opened the book as i was waiting for rescue i started reading it was old English and i couldn’t understand most of it. 
When i got home after spending a three days in the hospital i sat in front of my computer and started reading up and learning old English. 
I had found a book of summoning spells and it was fascinating that people, did those pranks so long ago too. 
One night i decided to test one summon, the book even contained a hand drawn picture of the creature it would supposedly summon. 
Everything was ready for me to summon Borzeg. 
I stoped my chuckle and began saying the incantations. After three minutes of chanting the spell ended. I already thought this was stupid and  what a mess i have made and that i had to clean everything myself with one hand and a limp. 

Suddenly a tremor in the air caught my attention, then thick smoke filled the circle of chalk and a sweet rotting smell. In the midst of smoke something stirred and i saw claws wings and a figure 7 feet tall! 

How dares summon me! Boomed the creature with a heavy voice. 

-Um i am Chad, are you the demon Borzeg? 

-Indeed i am, human why have you disturbed me?

-Ok good good, i was afraid i’d make a mistake, so can you please erase my existence from this planet? 

-What an unusual wish mortal, it’s the first time i hear these words from someone of your kind. 

-Well you see my life has gone downhill and i just cannot do it anymore man, i want this to end. 

We talked with the creature and i opened up to him with all my problems and my fears.

-I see, he said after a while, his voice more normal his appearance plain. I can help you live an extraordinary life if you sign this up, and as a bonus i will heal your injuries and this tumor you have in your testicles. 

-See man, i am cursed i have cancer too better to take my life. 

-Chad don’t be like that, here sign this and let me help you. 

-Alright Borzeg you win i said as my hand put my signature onto the old yellow paper. Instantly my leg and arm where completely fine. As for the other thing it had to be too, never felt it. 

-So how will you help me? 
-How about becoming a rock star said the demon with a glint in his eyes! 

I have to stop here guys i have to work. If anyone likes this or doesn’t let me know.
