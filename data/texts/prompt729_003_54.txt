In school they tell you it's normal not to remember your dreams. Specialists say that while they don't understand why we need dreams they're very important, which begs the question: if they're so important why do you forget? 

All the knowledge of man is at my finger tips and yet even I do not know the answer. Every night I study, this library has every subject ever thought of and studied by man and yet I still cannot find the answer. It's maddening!  

The people in my other life, my parents, they are beginning to worry. They're trying to find a child psychologist for me, but they don't know where to even start looking. I hear them whispering as they wake me up in the morning. "Happy Birthday Annabelle!" They cheered in unison when I opened my eyes. I smiled and went down stairs. I requested a microbes-themed birthday, something simple that I thought they'd be able to handle, I was excited to see it. 

The entire living was plastered instead with ballernias. "Sorry honey they were out of bacterium, so I went with the next alphabetical best thing!" My father said with false cheerfulness. I eyed the cartoon dancers with disappointment. "Her Arabesque is wrong. Look at her feet. She'll fall." I say pointing. I can see my parents exchange concerned looks, as far as they know I'd never studied ballet.  But that's where they were wrong. I studied everything and I never forgot. "That's not nice honey. You father and I did all this work for your birthday." My mother started to scold.

I remember when they were excited every time I shared something I'd studied with them "advanced", "intelligent","top of the class" they'd called me. Now they used words like "strange", "obsessive", "special needs".

I looked at the books in front of me, chemistry, biology, herbology, and cooking. I never forget anything and tomorrow is my birthday. I hope they let me help with the cake..
