I sat in my armchair, watching the live feed being transmitted from multiple cameras on the surface of earth.  Ever since I was cursed with immortality I knew that this day would come.  It was meant to be a punishment that I would watch my home slowly cook and disintegrate under a dying star.  Unfortunately, being a god does not make one omnipotent.

Humanity did not have the capability of intra-stellar travel let alone interstellar travel.  The god who cursed me thought that I would be bound to a singular rock that floats in space among trillions of other similar rocks.  What he didn't know is that I would spend my time learning how to manipulate mankind into advancing into the stars.  I learned the tools of currency, politics, conflict, greed, and other machinations of mankind.  I took roles of prominence to influence the course of history.  I guided mankind to the moon, then to mars, then throughout Sol.  I watched as man set foot on their first earth-like planet on a foreign star.

Over billions of years I raised billions of children.  I watched as humanity grew and grew, enveloping more of the milky way.  Mankind witnessed some of their adopted stars die and collapse, knowing it would be the fate of their own home star.  With my subtle hand, they began to prepare for today.  Mankind left their home planet, they left behind their first home, but they had millions of homes in the stars.  Humanity had overcome many of its obstacles and was all that it was meant to be.

The earth had long become unlivable as the temperature rose with the sun dying.  The ozone was long blasted away.  It wasn't the home I remembered from billions of years ago.  The continents had long changed and changed again.  It wasn't the home I knew.  However, it had meaning to me.  It was the cradle of all that humanity had grown from.  A child may move out of it's parents home, but it still dreams of its infancy.  I remember my first wife, my first family.  I remember where and when I buried her.  I remember the countless families I had since then.  I remember the trillions and trillions of stories told on that now lifeless rock.

I look at the countdown and only seconds remain before the sun goes supernova.  I let out a sigh as the sun collapses on itself and sends a shockwave outward at the speed of light.  I waited over seven billion years for eight minutes of torture.  The sensors spread out in Sol capture as Mercury shatters first.  The shockwave reaches Venus and the once acidic planet, which was once a beautiful terraformed paradise implodes.  Through a blurred vision of tears and anguish I watch as the Earth silently succumbs to what I knew was inevitable. 

&#x200B;

I resolved at that moment to disconnect from the universe.  I saved humanity from dying alone on a husk of a planet.  I helped humanity become what it was meant to be.  I done my part.

&#x200B;

Eons have passed and the universe itself is dying.  Humanity had transcended and is now able to live without physical burdens.  I sit in my armchair, watching as the last star goes supernova.  It explodes, just as the sun had all that time ago.  I remember the smell of her hair.  I remember the laughter of my first born child.  As the light from the last star fades I sit in darkness for what feels like eternity.  I draw in a deep breath and to an empty starship I mumble "Let there be light".
