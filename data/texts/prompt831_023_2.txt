“Well, well, well, Mr T, now that you have fallen in my trap, you might be wondering why I let you live, why did I choose you out of everyone else”  
“Because you’re in love with me?”  
“What?! No! Bullshit! Why would you say something like that?”  
“Come’on Richard, you have had a crush on me since the academy, it was obvious to everyone. And besides that… Richard, is that make-up on your face?”  
“Maaaybe”  
“What do you mean maybe? And what was that wink for? Are you flirting with me?"  
“Maybe I am”  
“Okay let me go now. You caused quite the fuss back in that village. Why did you need to slaughter all those people?”  
“You never paid any attention to me, no matter what I tried, no matter how hard I fought for it”  
“Okay, listen now, and hear what I have to…”  
“NO! You listen to me, handsome. Nothing I have ever done is worthy of your appreciation! The biggest terrorist attack of the decade? You didn’t care. Taking down a bloody satellite and taking out a battleship. Not a look in my direction by the untouchable Mr T. Can’t you see it? You can’t ignore me anymore though, not while being handcuffed to the chair”  
“With fluffy pink handcuffs. What the fuck is that?”  
“It’s called love John, you will never be able to get it. And don’t tell me again how you have a wife and how much you love her. I don’t wanna hear any of it”
“But I do have a wife and I do lov…”  
“ENOUGH! You are here now and you will pay for all those years of torture that I had to endure”  
“I don’t get it, what do you want from... Richard? What is that music? Why are you dancing? No, don’t take this off, please..”
