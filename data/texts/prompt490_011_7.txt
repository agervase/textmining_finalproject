I decided to grab it and walk to the kitchen to get a bowl or something to put it in, maybe it was someone's and I needed to return it, maybe put a poster saying that I found a mouse with a funny costume.

After I trapped the mouse in a plastic container, and put a lid on it, I heard something coming from behind the wall, my cat started to hiss and geature in a way that indicated danger. That's when I realised, it was more mice, they were coming to help their little friend.

I got so scared that I decided to take my cat and run away to my friend's house. I told him everything, even thought it sounded crazy, he still believed me, or then didn't and just wanted to come with me so I would calm down. I left my cat at his house.
 We went back to my house with some sprayable poison, you don't know if they attack.
 We saw nothing unusual until we got to the kitchen, there were a few mice with the same outfit, helping the trapped mouse get away. Then they looked at us deeply with their black eyes, my heart was pumping, then I felt something crawl up my pants, then there was pain, not too much, but still enough to make me move, felt like a tiny sword being shoved into my skin, and that's what it was. Everything slowed down, I saw that my friend was in a complete shock, then we ran, ran as fast as we could to the door, we made it outside, we killed all but one mouse, that one we took to my friend's car.

We didn't know what to do, but decided to go and show it to the police or something. It started to talk, I couldn't hear it well, but I leaned over and heard the words I will never forget "It's too late now."
