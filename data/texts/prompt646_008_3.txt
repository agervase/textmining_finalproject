I'm an old woman, and can't figure out why this witch in white wants to hurry things up so much. It really doesn't matter to me ... it doesn't. My vacant face will be covered over as I'm wheeled out the door anyway, by victorious cancer cells or by her design. I'm dead either way, give or take a month or two.

See, the question is why not have some fun while I'm at the business of dying. I always did have a subverted sense of humor. I can't think of a more deserving soul for my tainted whimsy than my sweet attentive nurse ... she's trying to kill me, you know.

One tends to view nurses as angels of mercy ... not this woman. I truly think she entered the profession because she likes to see people suffer. Her profession allows her to allay suffering or the means to inflict it. Sick, isn't it?

So how do I impose an obstacle between her and me? When she pushes that plunger into my IV, I'm helpless. Or am I? Maybe if I disengaged that connection and hid it under the sheet ... what if I closed that stop gap off entirely. I must study that apparatus. Surely, it can't be that complicated to inhibit that dose of poison into me. 

If I'm successful in doing that what should I do in return to her? I can't get her under investigation in the time I have left, prosecuted, or fired  ... no, but I can annoy her. What a delicious prospect!

Ha! I forgot the one stupid talent I have. I can slowly drop one eyelid in a slow, deliberate wink that always seems to bother people. I have icy blue, bug eyes with a large circle of bloodshot sclera that seems well, not  nicely human. I think I'll try that in the morning ... oh, what fun!
