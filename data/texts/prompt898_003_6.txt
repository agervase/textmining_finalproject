"To three years" Xan slurred out, raising a shot to the bar. To three years since his fiancee Junie had left. Left with a suitcase and exactly ninety percent of all their savings. Left with that damn man named Joe.

Xan knew very little of Joe, only that he came from a foreign country, and intended to take his now ex-fiancee back there to start a new life.

"To three years" The man on the stool next to him replied darkly with an unidentifiable accent, vaguely tipping his drink towards Xan.

It took Xan a moment to place him - perhaps it was the alcohol impairing his vision, perhaps it was the large gauze pad taped over his left eye. But it was unmistakably the renegade that whisked his fiancee away, Joe.

"No!" Xan protested, slamming his empty shot glass on the bar "You dont get toast. I mean, youuu, don't get *hiccup* get to toast - If it weren't for you, I would've married her *hiccup* we would've been happy"

"I think you've had enough there, pal" Joe replied calmly, turning in his seat to face him.

"What happened to your *hiccup* face?" Xan spat back, taunting him like a child in the schoolyard "You're not looking so good know, are ya?"

"Xan, look, I actually came back because-" Joe kept his words calm and non threatening, Xan wasn't interested in hearing what he had to say, though.

"Where did the two of you even go?" Xan asked, his downward spiral now becoming more apparent, "Where did you come from? *hiccup* Where did ya go?"

A long silence passed, Xan absentmindedly spun the shot glass in his hand.

"Hey? Cotton Eye Joe?" Xan leaned back in satisfaction at his insult. It was the best a drunk mind could do after all.

"Australia"
