It getting colder I think to my self as i look at the grey I (i think November sky). It’s been awhile since I have seen someone sometimes you wish you could just turn into the undead just like everyone else, it would be easier, much easier then seeing your friends and family and everyone you seemed to even remotely care about go through the pain but at least they wont have to suffer mentally. It’s been 2 months since the last sighting of a human when I listen to the animals as i hunt them for there blood (its like drinking straight creek water but blood is blood) i hear them whisper that the humans are gone, but i know, i know there are some, some where making a cure making a cure for vampires zombies and everyone to come out of the war. A little longer and he next human I see, If any, I will be able to hold my self back i couldn’t last time. I woke up what i think to be a day later next to a shriveled bow who couldn’t have been older then me before i turned. The last thing I remember was catching the sent he had cut himself on some rocks after a fall and i could smell it, smell it from 1 mile away and i ran, much after then he could.
The last two months I have been less myself I feel so alone, all the time, I wish I could see my family again i cry every morning before i go to bed. I miss the sun, i miss, warmth i miss, my home. It hurt to much to stay, that feeling was much worse then any thing i feel now, just as long as i keep moving i don’t think about it and just keep walking from ruined city to ruined city eventually it will get better weather it be death of others to satisfy my always hungry feeling or my own to end my suffering to maybe if what they used to say about an after life i can see them again.
