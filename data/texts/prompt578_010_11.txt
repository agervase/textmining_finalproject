“You don’t have to do this anymore, John. Please, don’t.” She sobbed into my arms, tears flowing down her face. “Remember? Remember what happened last time? It took you months to get back, only to be covered in bandages!”

“I’m sorry, Elly.” I started, softly brushing her off. “But as long as I have this power, as long as I can still help people, I need to use it. I’m sure you understand.”

I felt terrible for this. But it must be done. For every time I tapped 4 times in a row, I could help save someone’s life. That wasn’t something any other person could do.

“I’ll be more careful this time, I promise. I’ll be back before you know it.” I tell her. Elly let go, and hung her head in defeat. I hated to see her like this.

I head into my room, locking the door, strapping on some nylon, a gun for safety, a small pocket knife, and the sturdiest boots I could find. I stared back at myself in the mirror, all kitted out. Time to get started, I guess.

Tap.
Tap.
Tap.

“Goodbye, John.”

Tap.

Sent whirling into the big city, I dive as gunshots fly over my head. The person over on my end of the firefight looked surprised. 

“Go! I’ll handle this!” I shouted. A shaky nod, and the other guy dashes into the shadows.

Returning fire, I aim for their legs. Nothing lethal, I hope. Looks like I bought enough time, it’s best if I get out now.

Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.

This time, I was thrown into a hospital room, to accompany a dying old man with no visitors.

With the sound of the flatline, I sigh and depart again.

Tap. 
Tap. 
Tap. 
Tap.

Saved a man sleeping at the wheel. Hitting the brakes as he startles awake, I leave before he notices I was there.

Tap.
Tap.
Tap.
Tap.

This time around, I recognized my surroundings. I was standing there, right in front of the mirror, as if I haven’t left. I feared the worst.

I fumbled at the door, cursing that I had locked it before I left. “Elly! Elly!” I shouted, hoping my voice got through the walls. The lock giving way, I burst through the doorway to see Elly perched precariously on a stool, a rope twisted around her neck. Her eyes widened as she saw me there. She took a step forward, forgetting where she was. I tried. I reached out towards her, hand stretched out. The sickening crack was the last sound she heard.
