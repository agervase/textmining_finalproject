Death leaned back, defeated. Only partially visible behind impossibly dark mist, he took a long drag from his cigarette. Raped his bony fingers on the table. His intense menacing red eyes had become less threatening, they were bewildered, both amused and annoyed. 

For the longest time he stayed quiet staring off, taping his fingers. Tap, tap, tap. He took one last drag then shifted his eyes to Quill, almost, or perhaps actually, looking into his soul. A playful smile rose to Deaths face, exposing his rotting fangs, and he let out a disturbing snicker. Shivers went down Quills back and he gulped. He hoped Death didn’t notice he was shaking. Of course Death didn’t need to see him trembling to know how he was feeling, Death lived for that shit, if you will.

“You know...” An raspy voice grumbled. It was Ancient yet almost enthusiastic and came from no where but everywhere. Death spoke on.
“No ones ever beat me.” Death was now focused on the chess board.  The centrepiece to the lightless universe Quill was sent to immediately after dying. “Billions of people and no one has won. Huh” he sighed and put his hands on the table.

Quill just stared back at him, jaw hanging open. It’s not too often Quill is at a loss for words, but staring at a distraught and confused Death definitely made the list.

“Should I punish you or reward you? Hmmm... probably reward, but damn. I had a really fucking long streak going.” Death mumbled, still staring off. Quill didn’t notice. “I guess I could give your life back... but the council doesn’t really like that... lotta red tape. Hmm. Ya like killing people?”
Quill was deep in his own anxious thoughts. 𝐼 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑑. 𝐶h𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 𝑡h𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑙. 𝑇𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒, 𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑚, 𝑎𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔. 𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑎𝑏𝑦𝑠𝑠. 𝐿𝑒𝑡 𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑢-“

“Oi!” Death barked, snapping his fingers. Quill jumped up, returning to the chess game hosted in limbo.
“I said, do you like killing?”
Quill stared, puzzled. He looked Death in the eyes and as if he had an epiphany, the fear ceased. Quickly, almost automatically, he sparked up, twinkle in his eye. “I like killing a game of chess, every so often.”

Deaths eyebrows raised, flabbergasted, then turned angry again, trying but not quite succeeding in maintaining his menacing composure. Death couldn’t help but smirk ever so slightly. “Watch your mouth boy.”

Feeling unusually cocky now. “Or what? Gunna break out the monopoly?” 

Death was not impressed with that one. “Alright. You better deflate your ego real fucking quick. I will accept, even appreciate, the first jab. But I am the fucking Devil and I have a small tolerance for you’re shit. Wanna get tortured but never die, for eternity? Cuz that’s the kinda shit we do here. This is the one warning I’m only giving due to the circumstances. There will be no second.” All amusement was vacant of Deaths face. Probably left the abyss too, took a one way trip to anywhere but limbo. Quill felt the raging eyes pierce into his soul.
