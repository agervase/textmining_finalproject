As  the 100-year-old Dave Rockefeller lay on his bed on yet another sunday night, he began to feel the invisible pull from nowhere once again. His pupils widened for a second, but the excitement quickly left its place to annoyance. He  groaned a little bit, tried to force out a yawn but couldn't succeed. Then he took his position in the bed, laying still as he always did. He was ready. "Let's get this over with", he thought to himself. "Again".

He remembered the night when it first happened. How scary it had been, how hard he tried to fight against it...It was a night as soft as a pillow in Paris, a city that somehow still enchanted him to this day while most of everything else was, to put it simply, ordinary. He was in the balcony of a great ballroom after shaking the  hands of God knows how many politicians and economists. While his mind was still as sharp and witty as a cheetah despite his age, his body could not take these long parties anymore. It had already began to fall apart many times, failing him at every occasion by presenting heart attacks and such, he was yet to be brought down by one. He had changed his heart and kidneys so often now that it was a normal part of life.

However it was never easy. Therefore when the heart-ache began again on that balcony and the dizziness caused him to lose sight of his surroundings, he was scared. Scared for his life once again, for no matter how far he got, how much he lived, he still had so many plans for his future. He couldn't abandon them now.

As his body crashed to the floor a few seconds after the champagne glass in his hand's thunderous shatter was heard, he felt this pull coming from somewhwere else. As if being summoned to somewhere, he was pulled apart from his body with enormous strength. He knew it then that this was different. He was sure of the end. So many things still unanswered...

Yet he woke up. Like opening up your eyes in a hospital bed and finding out that you've been sleeping for days, he simply opened his eyes. At first he had to make sure they were open:  The place he was in was pitch-black. Was he drugged and kidnapped? Where was he? What did his abductors want?

Was this the afterlife he was taught to believe in?

Then a far away light shone on the ground, revealing a grey, metal box. "I'm definitely kidnapped", he thought, as he slowly approached the box, the only material in sight. As he got close, he began to recognize a few words on it . With a meter in between them, he faced the box and read the words out loud :  **"Pay 1$ to live for another day"**

A laugh came over him. This was the cost of life? A mere dollar? What a tease. With a smile that would disturb even the most peaceful, he reached into his pocket and slowly took out a coin. He shouted at the empty space around him: "If this is what you want, then it's allright by me! You know you could've asked for more, but who am I to judge!" This brought enormous joy to him. He located the coin slot just under the joke-like words, smugly slid the coin and felt the immediate crash of a lightning inside his head.

He woke up after that, on the same ballroom's balcony in Paris. A crowd was over him, trying to decide what to do. He got up and looked around. Tens of people, each trying to bring a glass of water or asking if he's allright. He took a second to process the situation. Looked around and blanked himself out from the outer world. Bells rung inside his brain. He was not kidnapped. He had actually come back from afterlife.

He started laughing. He laughed like he hadn't done since his childhood, a laugh so powerful that it would brush over the world like a tornado and leave nothing but dust behind. The people around him, half-scared and concerned, took a step back and threw judging stares at his maniacal laugh. They didn't know. It was the laugh of victory.

Then reality set in and he stopped laughing.

Life was a fucking joke. Just like he figured out in the his real life, money set the rules. Money set the power. No matter what the life, be it after or before, money was the solution to all problems. His father had built an empire over money, an empire which only grew stronger in his helm. He had the power to turn the countries against each other, crash a country's economy with one swift move and do all this while sitting in his living room sipping the flashiest of bourbons. And now he knew the only thing he could not defeat, the only thing standing in his way, his good ol' enemy death was preventable. He was hurdleless. Unstoppable. Life had put up all the challenges it could against him, and he had obliterated every single one of them. He repeated in his head: Life is a fucking joke.

Every day since that day, at bedtime everyday, he was called up to the pitch-black emptiness. Every day the cost of another day rose by a dollar. He didn't care. He was the richest man in the world. It became a chore to him, a mild annoyance he had to face. Death, as he knew it, had lost its mystery. Just like every other thing he had seen.

So here he was again, at age 100, summoned once again to the blackness. He opened his eyes, got up and looked around. He scratched his back. Then the light shone on the box again, and he approached it taking the necessary funds out of his pocket. Yet as he got closer, he found the words he came to recognize every night were different, and the money slot closed. Trying to hide his suprise, he faced the box with a meter between them, just like in his first day, and read the words aloud:

"**Pay 1$ for every time you watched nugget porn".**

And at that moment, Dave Rockefeller realized one thing: Time had come for him to die.
