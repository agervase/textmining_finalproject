A week after the event, I finally went on the internet. You think the world would end in thunder and lightning, but really it ended with a quiet shower. 

It was hard to type with everything that had happened, but I logged onto my last refuge. Time and time again, through the mountains and crevasses of my old life... when the worst was when my mind wouldn't make a sound, I could always throw my voice into the void and get voices back.

But, after everything that had happened... would there be anyone to listen? 

A new post blinked on my screen. "Is anyone left?" Another voice screaming into the void. To my surprise as I clicked on the thread to answer, there were thousands of voices calling back. 

I don't know how long we all talked. We organized ourselves into what locations we were all in. I thought I was alone in Colorado, but there were hundreds still left, hiding in the devastation. Little voices in the silence of the darkness. For a while, it was enough.

But we all knew that it wouldn't be. There were threads of them searching for survivors. Thanks to our communications, we could judge where they were and direct our fellows away from them. But we could all only run for so long before our power ran out. Who knew how long the servers could run for. 

Finally, I put out a thread. "We need to fight". To hell with it all, we were all dead anyway. Screaming into the void, I got roars back. Something that people tended to forget before all of this: we weren't stereotypes. We were anyone: military, scientists, students; people with lives and skills who sometimes just needed to talk to someone, anyone. And we were pissed. 

I'm with the Colorado group now. I'm writing this for the future, if there is one. There is no silence in my mind; no void. It is so loud now. We're going to fight, kill, roar into the void that they created and dare them to even try to create it again. They might try to silence us, but we will not go quietly.
