“Well look who’s back again, if it isn’t the luckiest man alive” Death says sarcastically as I approach the table.

“I really hope not” I reply as I pick up the coin.

“Come on now, most people are happy to get a second chance” Retorts Death with a laugh

“I was cool with the second chance, even the third, but this is getting ridiculous” I say as I flick the coin into the air one more time. I close my eyes as I hear the distinct ‘ping’ ‘ping’ ‘rattle’ of the coin settling down on the marble table. Death’s laugh is all I need to hear to know that I’ve lost once again.

“Look at that, it’s the luckiest day of your life again” Death says with a smile. 
“You know the rules, pick a date”

“Do I really have to? Seriously, just let it end, I can’t do it again.” I plead.

“Not my choice mate” Death says sympathetically “even I have to follow the rules”

“Yeah, you’ve told me a thousand times” I angrily say

Death lets out a loud laugh as he says “more than that my friend, more than that”

“Fuck you. January 8th, 2012” I growl at him

“Are you sure you don’t want to go a little further back and try again?” Death asks, already knowing the answer.

“I figure there can’t be too many other ways I can try it at this point”

“You’d be surprised” Death says as he waves his hand past my face.
I wake up and look at the clock. 7:19am. Again. It’s always 7:19am. I fucking hate that time. I look over at my wife. I fucking hate my wife. I look at the picture of my family next to the night stand. I fucking hate my family. I don’t know this family nearly as well as some of the others, but I still fucking hate them. I fucking hate all of it. I fucking hate living. I’m ready to die and stay that way.

I reach over to the nightstand, pull out the 9mm, put in my mouth and pull the trigger.

“Well look who’s back again”
