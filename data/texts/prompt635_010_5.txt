Well, I tried to follow him but it was hard keeping up with the guy.

I mean, he dropped straight through the floor in an instant. Looked up from my coffee cup and his hat's sinking through the carpet. I didn't even get to ask him why.

Knocked on the downstairs neighbors door pretending to borrow some sugar, sure enough I bet you he had dropped straight through the floor there too.

All thirteen floors straight down to the street. Or further? I checked the basement after hours with a pickaxe and a flashlight. Floor is solid cement. Took a few whacks at it with the pick but I'm no coal miner. Would take me years to make any meaningful progress. Who knows how far I'd have to go?

Since I'm a foreman I was able to get my hands on the schematics for sewage and maintenance tunnels under the apartment building. 

Nothing. Well, nothing anybody like him would go to. 

No, no. That wasn't the answer. He must have gone down. *Down*, down.

Straight down as far as anyone can go. Through anger, wrath and hatred, depravity and jealousy, rage. I shouldn't have to say much more.

I had to find him again.

I left the church the next Sunday and drove straight from there to an animal shelter and I grabbed as many animals as they would let me take. Told them I lived on a farm and needed lots of dogs for work and companionship.

I drowned them in my hands one by one.

I stabbed a homeless man in the neck the next afternoon. Nobody even noticed.

After that it was really just a whirlwind of bloodlust. I didn't even know I had it in me but I guess it all makes sense now. So many now I can't even remember.

I've been on the run for a while but I don't think I have to go any further. I'm ready. I will take my own life and descend to where he is and there I'll be able to ask him why.

I'm sorry I did this to our family but I had to know.

Love,

Your adoring husband, Rob
