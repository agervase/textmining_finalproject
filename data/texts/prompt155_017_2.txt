Gluttony was really not that great of a chef; more of an ok cook, or semi-decent caterer. What it lacked in ability, however, it made up for in quantity. 

"Mmm. S'good." I said between mouthfuls of scrambled egg and bacon.

I could see the conflict play out across the heinous manifestation of humanities ability to eat itself sick's face: without a head, Gluttony's huge mouth gaped from its body, its tiny arms and huge, muscular legs worked in frustration to.

"Well, at least you're eating." was all it could muster. When I first got here I was barely a hundred pounds soaking wet. Misery, it turns out, is bad for the appetite. Grabbing a handful of dry but yummy coffee cake and mug of lukewarm Folgers I stood up and made to leave. 

I was almost out the door when Vanity clapped its hand on my shoulder. 

"You! Your *not* leaving with a facefull of syrup and dried egg, surely!" 

Its utterly androgynous but absolutely attractive face looked down into my eyes. As always I was gripped with an urge to both caress and slap those perfect cheeks. 
 Tall but not lithe and meaty without being chunky, Vanity could appear in any form to anyone (as could they all) but showed me their true form in service of my shattered my ego and diminished id. 

Satisfied with my face, I had to bat its hands away after it straightened my collar and went to tuck in my shirt.

"Hey, save some for Lust, eh?" I said, finally making the door. 

I exited into another building, this one a cross between my elementary, junior and high schools instead a hybrid of my mom's first apartment and our childhood home. I was vaguely aware that I wanted to, -needed- to get Outside but so far all the doors were either locked or led to more rooms. 

"You can do it!" Shouted Pride as I passed its podium; Pride had a podium like Vanity had comely lightning.
