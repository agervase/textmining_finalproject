You ever have those days, where you feel utterly invisible to the rest of the world? You walk past crowds of people but they might as well be lifeless statues? You wake up in the morning and go, "Why bother?" and crawl back to bed. You walk past tall city buildings and realize they're nothing but cold stone. Well I can promise you, no matter how much you think you've felt isolated (and still feel), you'll never feel as isolated as I am. And no, I'm not trying to be somehow "cooler" than you. I'm not saying it out of pride.

Like you, I'm surrounded, but alone. Everyone around me is just a piece of useless meat. The world seems darker than it used to. Some probably understand how I feel, most don't. All around me, stone pillars are far above my head. No one cares about what I'm doing or where I am. The few who know assume I'm fine where I am, but I'm not. In the past, I had to resort to drugs and alcohol to feel much of anything.

Unlike you though, I can't be helped. It's not a matter of not wanting to be helped. Unlike you, I didn't wake up today in my bed thinking "Why bother?" Unlike you my world is much, much darker. I can't walk past crowds of people anymore. I feel more alive than ever. And I really...really regret mixing my drugs and alcohol.

Because for you, it's all metaphorical. And for me it's literal.

Because today, I did wake up in a bed.  I woke up from one of my drug and alcohol induced comas. And the world is much colder, smaller and darker now. And I really don't want to fall back asleep.

Because today, I woke up in my own coffin.
