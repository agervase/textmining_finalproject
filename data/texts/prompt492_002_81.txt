For the first time, the whiskey swayed in my hand. It's aftertaste long since settled in the back of my mouth, and the bottle rolled in the gloom like an empty skull. Silent tears and countless questions I never dared to ask replaced the itching void I felt inside. I travelled inside my mind, and found horrors and holes I didn't want to remind.

It didn't take me long to understand. This was what those pensive stares of the mortals concealed: a flawed man struggling to answers questions he should never ask, while holding the weight of a chaotic world on his back.

Earlier that day, I had reaped the soul of a man who had been forgotten, but who hadn't died. An anomaly. Something that shouldn't be possible.  

He was old and lonely. The outer world had long since lost meaning to him. That's why every night, sip by sip, he drowned in his flaws instead. 

It hadn't always been like that. In the past, the silence had been filled with the laughter of his children, and the smile of her wife had kept the shadows away. What had changed? That was the question he had struggled to unravel until the end of his days. 

Since they had gone, the man had lost himself in his mind, searching for an answer he would never find. For the answer had lay in his hand, and he had long since gone blind.

In the end, broken shards had gleamed in the dark. His breaths had disturbed the perfect silence, and I had been witness of a man who in his persistence had forgotten his existence.

I took a deep breath, and left my glass on the table. The whiskey rippled inside.

Some things are better left aside.
