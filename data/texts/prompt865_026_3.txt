The vibrantly dressed man staggers into the elevator, obviously in distress. I look over to him holding his groin, presumably trying to hold off nature's call. I could easily make it harder for him to hold it in, or make his bladder explode, or even freeze time itself. But I'm much better than that.

I instantly hit every button in the elevator.

I laugh hysterically as he cowers in pain and agony as he watches in horror over my actions. But hey, at least it was funny to somebody.

I eventually teleport out of the elevator, away from the man's screams as he struggles in his own personal hell, to the swimming pool. I make quick work of the masseuse of a lady and begin massaging her myself. I tend to be really good at almost everything, so she obviously enjoyed it.

Of course I untied her bra, who do you think I am?

Eventually I just had to try out dating and took this lovely woman I met at the library, next to the one I made smell the finger I put in my ass. She seems to be quite charming, but not that interested in me. Of course, I can change that in an instant. Hell, I could make her willing to give up her life for me, but that's unnecessary really.

As she goes over to take the seat I offered her at the table in the restaurant, I pull the oldest trick in the book.

I assumed humans to be an intelligent species, but clearly not, as evidenced by her falling flat on the ground and whining about how I pulled her chair away.

My victims never recover from the traumatic experiences I give them. I am the terror of the Earth. Whenever any poor soul who fell victim to my attacks dares to ask, "Why are you doing this? Who are you?",  I always respond with the same answer.

"I'm a mother father gentleman!"
