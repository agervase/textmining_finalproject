     Another rejection notice.  Sighing in defeat I tossed it in the trash with the others.  I knew finding a job would be hard but not this hard. 46 applications and so far 46 rejections.  I had applied to everything I could think of from retail to salesman to fast-food.  But nope. Just like every thing else in life no matter how hard I try I failed. My old man always said "As long as you try your hardest you can never fail."  Tell that to my grades, collage, my driving tests, my friends, literally any thing I have ever tried.  I always seemed to fail somehow. 
 Bzzt.  Bzzt.
My phone vibrates.  Odd.  Who could be calling me at this hour?  Must just be a sales call.  I fish out my phone to see who it is. I mean it can't hurt to look. 
Mom?
Why would she call me? We haven't talked in years. Not since I moved to collage, well the only one that would accept me anyway.  I am hesitant. What will she say?  I decided to answer if only to hear her voice. And am rewarded with nothing but silence. Then from the other end a nervous "Hello?" It's my mom's voice I would recognize it any were. 
       "Mom?" I reply. Completely clueless as to why she was calling.
      "I'm sorry ......"she sounds distraught, and on the verge of tears "we should have told you .....we thought you could handle it ......I thought you were handling it."  
       What is she talking about? "So...." With a little resolve "Your father and I have come to a decision ......and we have decided that you have been through enough hard times .....so we decided to change it make things easier on you."
       From that I day forward something changed in me.  Maybe I had a change of mind or new motivation or something like that.  But regardless from that day forth things actually started working out for me.  Not everything worked or was easy all the time.  But it was world's better than before she called.  What ever my parents changed I know they made the right choice.
       I just wonder what it was.
