Those who wish eternal life are blind, ignorant of its implications, and the toll it can take on one's mind. After your second century and third reincarnation, everything becomes a gray, soundless circus with poorly articulated performers, which you are forced to watch over and over again.

I don't expect you understand, I don't expect anyone to understand, for some things can only be truly grasped by living them. You will nod at my words, convince yourself that immortality is a burden, and you will doubt if you really want eternal life after all. However, the truth is you will only understand a shard of the entire broken glass.

Immortality is not a burden, but an endless curse.

I apologize for what I will do. I truly do. You are not guilty of my condition. You are not guilty of what will happen. You are just living your life, trying to make it as bearable as possible. 

But life is as fragile as a dry leave under a boot.

Knowledge is not always a good thing. It all depends of the mind who has it, and the use that mind gives it. Unfortunately, throughout my life, I came across an eerie idea by sheer coincidence.

At first, it was no more than a simple rumor. "Did you know they create artificial diseases capable of extinguishing the whole life in laboratories?" They said, and shook their heads. But it was a simple rumor, and nothing else, the crazy sayings of an old lady who spent perhaps too much time with her cats.

Truth is, I obsessed over that rumor, and I chased it for the last two centuries. At last, I confirmed the rumor was a blatant lie.

But that didn't stop me from studying, and creating my own disease.

The moment I finish writing this, the disease will be released.

I'm sorry. I don't expect you understand.

But it was the only way.
