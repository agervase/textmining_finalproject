Wings and fire. Scales and Blood. Terrified human screams and terrible draconic roars. A broken treaty, and a terrible vengeance. The aerial siege of the keep was a drawn out affair; for sport and retribution, not out of necessity. In the first weeks nobody in the outlying villages was safe. Now in the fourth week, the dragons flew overhead constantly, 24 hours a day of snatching people from their homes: a thatch roof does very little.

In the Catacombs of the keep, Prince Braden is still taking his lessons daily. His mother insists ignorantly that all will be well, and will *not* allow me any break from my teaching duties with the future king, despite my protests that there almost certainly will not be a future.  

In protest, today's arithmetic lesson will be replaced with a history lesson to help the young Prince understand our predicament. 

"It was the fourth year of the reign of your great-great-great-great-great...how many greats was that I just said?"

Braden looked upwards, "five!"

"okay, well it was your 10-greats-grandfather, the very first Lion King of The Second City, who this lesson is about."

"He was a great hero wasn't he!?" This young man had better not interrupt me or the next lesson will be swordplay, or possibly cleaning latrines...

"More of a negotiator, really, but quite a heroic one. now no more interruptions,close your eyes and imagine the scene I set out for you with my words. It was the fourth year of your 10-great-grandfather's reign when he negotiated the most heroic treaty in history, in the hall right above our very heads..."

The walls stank of sulfur, but not from the enormous, lithe creature in front of King Percival. Two weeks prior an attack had burnt much of the throne room, including the throne. Percival stood with a hunch, eyes red and puffy, leaning on First Knight Donahugh, barely attempting to look regal.

As frayed as Percival looked, not even the beautiful but terrible beast in front of him could put him off; he had lost everything, there was nowhere lower for a broken man to go when he was afraid to hold even the tiniest sliver of hope.

"Percy, I assume your offer of reward still stands, yes? The reward for safe return of your most precious treasure?"

For such a large creature, it was graceful in every way, including it's speech.

"Speak creature, this old man will not be killed again by a false hope. I do of course offer reward."

"reward beyond my wildest imagination, said the whispers that reached me" The dragon now let slip a tiny smidgen of it's graceful image and for a moment became the embodiment of a hard-up silk merchant in a poorly placed booth at the market.

"Beyond the wildest imagination of any human. If you were to rescue my stolen daughter, of course some agreement will be reached." Was it a hint of optimism from Percival? Donahugh's no longer looked to be holding the King's entire weight.

"Of course, the feudal station has no use for me or mine. I do however, desire the land...King Percival, your daughter can be returned to you, but my brood will face grave peril, and must be compensated in perpetuity. The land and station may be granted to whoever you see fit, but the yields must be delivered to my brood...perpetually." Draconic grins are often subtle, but the silk merchant was on full display now.

"King Percival went on to forge a powerful alliance and a lasting treaty with the very same creatures. Of course our empire wasn't build with simple manpower, but in alliance with the creatures that torment us now"

"Is it true what they say Merlin? That it's Papa's fault?" The boy is furtive, nearly embarrassed. Of course it was his father's fault, the fool thought being a lion meant taking what you need. Terrible negotiator.

"Your father did what he thought was best for us all. Now shush, your mother is coming, quick, give me 90 divided by 15."
