My eyes widen as I look down at the Roomba in front of me. The Roomba starts wiggling and beep boop beeps like R2D2 to let me know it’s sentient.

“Ah crap,” I exclaimed.

Suddenly, a the disembodied sounds of the Benny Hill theme, Yakety Sax starts playing. The knife-wielding Roomba starts rolling toward me, at speeds never achieved by any other robotic vacuum. I decided it was probably best that I didn’t stick around to find out what it wanted.

I ran into the house with the deadly Roomba following a few feet behind. The shed door opens, and I come out of there, with the Roomba still behind me. I climb up the tree house, and as I get to the top, the Roomba is already waiting for me. I jump back down, and the Roomba hits the the ground rolling. I run behind a tree and look out one side. The Roomba looks out the other. The Roomba sees me and starts chasing me around the tree. I’m running, running, running, before finally jumping up to a higher branch. The Roomba continues rolling in circles around the tree, before stopping and looking around. The disembodied Yakety Sax fades out.

I think I’m safe until the branch I’m on cracks and I fall to the ground. The Roomba turns and sees me and realizes it has me cornered. It slowly starts closing in as I scream out for mercy.

“No. What do you want from me?”

It gets closer and closer. And just when I think it’s about to kill me, I look down, and it’s using the knife to spread avocado on toast. I look in disbelief. The Roomba then hands me the slice of avocado toast as it beeps and boops.

“For me? Thank you.”

The Roomba then slowly rolls away, off into the sunset, as I enjoy my slice of avocado toast.
