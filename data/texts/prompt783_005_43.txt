"They're always told that they have five senses. I never fully understood why society undermines the mind, which surely is the sixth sense.  

Their entire being is projected through the mind. All other five senses merge into what the mind interprets them as.  

If they are to acknowledge the mind, then they would hold it to a higher value than everything else. The mind is the life. Thoughts are the very fabric of being.   

You look at your hands and body, and you get that eerie strange feeling, of how these limbs are sticking out of you right now, and are being controlled by hundreds of nerves attached so delicately to the bones, amongst all the flesh in between.  

You decide the rest of your day, and by making that decision, the movement of your entire body is dictated by these thoughts.  

Do you really think you are just *creating* these thoughts from scratch?  

**Do you really think you are capable of independent thought?**  

You are wrong.

I have finally learnt the truth. And I sure am enjoying this. Sorry Mark, your body belongs to me now. Don't fight it."

Mark's eyes widened as he was trying to fathom what he just read.  
He was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when he was eight, and his mood wings can be extreme to the level of two apparent separate personalities.  

Medications had minimal effect.

It was twenty-two years later that Mark found that note, with a massive ink stain towards the bottom right-corner, just under the sunlight ray peeking through his room's window.  

Mark was absolutely flabbergasted. He sat down and started to trace his thoughts and actions within the past twenty-four hours.  

*Alright, I must remember when I wrote this note. I might not be crazy after all. I came home from Hannah's dinner party just before midnight, I was starving, her vegan dinner was shit. I grabbed the spaghetti I made on Tuesday then sat and started browsing reddit for a while. I then started writing? I think I'm right. This is the right sequence of events so far. Next I must ha-*  

*Hey Mark. I said don't fight it. Why don't you go for a drive right now, and go and try winning some money at the pub like you always do with some alcohol?*  

Mark got up abruptly from his chair, knocking his ink from the table, grabbed a jacket, and left the hut.

"Does he really think he lives in the 1830's?"  

"I don't know. Apparently his latest gig is that a parasite is controlling him". 

"I feel bad, he just completely lost it didn't he?"  

"Yeah. I think our lunch break is over, we should head back to the main ward now, I heard there are new patients coming in". 

"Let's go".
