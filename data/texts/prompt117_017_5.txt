"Alright, James, once you're done with your lunch break, I need the paperwork," my boss demanded. Even at lunch, my boss was still up our noses, demanding work.

I nod and go my merry way towards the elevator. "Hmm, Cafeteria... uhh.. Ground floor." Clicking the buttons, the elevator starts its downward trek. I was always scared of elevators as a kid, and what was about to happen next really justifies that "phobia".

Suddenly, the elevator stops moving. I was on the 11th floor, and ground floor was not a 1 minute of movement. Anticipating the door opening, nothing happened. I started panicking. Heart palpitations and all that. I started sweating profusely, and immediately ran up to that dreaded bell button to call for help. I started spamming it, holding it, nothing. Not even the horn of it - *It was jammed*. Totally out of power. I threw my briefcase on the ground in madness and lied down on the floor. I closed my eyes, waiting for the unknown.

Suddenly, the door opens. My watch confirmed that my time spent stuck was *two hours*. The light was heavy on my eyes. I got up, carrying my briefcase, and stepped outside the elevator.. And what I saw was an absolute shock. The building was absolutely different. Unfamiliar faces. Susan was no longer the lobby host, the janitor was not Afro-haired Louis with the most humorous spirit, the desks were not manned by the employees who were my *friends*. I did not recognize a soul. I look up to check the large mechanical clock that I was so familiar with, only I was greeted by a digital clock that shows the date. *December 2nd, 2018. 4:34PM*. I started visibly shaking. My face was very wet, and I was getting the occasional stares from those not-seen-before faces.

I tried to comprehend what was going on. People were holding hand-sized.. things. Those things had big screens! Apparently, they're phones according to my deduction, as people put them on their ears and scream into them, just like cellular phones, or flip phones. And they seemed to respond to clicks on the screen, unlike the trendy flip phones with the number pad and the multiple letters per number button. They also had screens for computers, and those screens do not look very thick, they're actually very thin, and they had those weird, different wires. People were not very communicative. I was absolutely in awe. I had read about a time travel effect. I thought it was total bullshit, though. This.. this was a shocker. 

I walk on and try to talk to the lobby host. Sitting on her desk with what looked like a full ton of make up filling her face, especially cheeks, she looked up to me and looked repulsed. Probably because I was wearing 19 year old clothes. Those clothes were probably older than her! 

"Excuse me, ma'am, do you know a Mister James Taylor who works here?" I asked, curious to see her reply. 

"Not really, but I can check the database for entries." She replied. 

"*Database*? *Entries*? What is she on about?" I thought. I just nodded affirmatively and anticipated what she would have to say. 

After about 2 minutes, she continued, "Ah, yes, James Taylor, desk employee circa 1991-1999. Died in a jammed elevator accident, due to lack of oxygen. His death came to light after the jammed elevator was never found to work again, and when his wife and daughter were very concerned,  his body was found in the elevator again. Apparently, the reason why the elevator jammed was because of his boss at the time, who is also dead now, shutting down the power to save power."

*I must have fallen into an alternate universe. There is no other explanation to this.*

Thanks for reading my piece, first time submitting for WP although I am an accomplished novelist at 16 years old (perhaps why this is too long?). Anyway, I also won't ask you to sub to my sub, partly because I don't have one, but I also find this request annoying. Thanks for reading, hope you had fun!
