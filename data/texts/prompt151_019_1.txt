The bread piece, and its outline, was already beginning to blur. He never had the slightest notion of life there. At times, when he looked at it, he thought he saw a breaded crumb with a human anatomy sitting quietly; looking into space. He imagined that the figure wasn't lost in thought, and thus cut off from everything else, but free and full of ease, as if he himself were within this world alone, and it could dream about the knife and its origin. To the figure, the knife was Excalibur – something so mysterious and out of this world that no mortal man stood a chance against, and thus it became engraved in stone – a legend, and something no one could entangle. The knife itself was an immortal figure which stood frozen in time and space.

Alex casually picked up the knife and clumsily continued cutting the bread. He could imagine the little breaded figure having his own world transformed by such a tremendous sight. What would he tell his friends? Did he just meet the man who broke the legend; not only that, but without having any notion of the impossible nature of such a task? What will the other figures embedded within this world think? Will they also have such a glorious supposition, extending the tale to include giant 15 year old gods whom from to time to time become entangled in the worlds of their own immortal figures?

That, or, maybe he was just a fuck up. Maybe none of those things mattered, and his imagination worked to mask the darkness that surrounded his own life; the abuse and the toll of alcoholism and drug induced dementia which spread like a disease, receding into him and creating a world where breaded figures had heroes. Such things sometimes happen in enveloping darkness. 

The longer he looked, the less he could make out, and everything receded into twilight. The car honked and he took off into another dimension, to tell and imagine other stories. The legend of breaded Excalibur was a legend of human pain.
