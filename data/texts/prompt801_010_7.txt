"I'm so sorry for your loss, but you know what? I'll bet that Ms. Thalia is sittin' up there in Heaven, just watching over you." A woman in her mid-forties, who I'm to believe is one of Thalia's aunts, had come up to me after the service to 'console' me with a casserole in hand. Of course, I have to accept her gift of food; after all, this is the South that we live in. I would have found her words to be comforting if two things weren't true. The first is that I'm Pagan; the second being that I can literally see my dead wife standing right next to this woman.

As every member of Thalia's family who came to her funeral decides to converse with me and offer their food and condolences, I watch as my wife tries to get me to look at her. I don't even have to see her face to know that there are tears running down her cheeks, and it tortures me. I was surprised to see hundreds of spirits walking around the cemetery the very moment that I drove in, but to know that Thalia had to witness her own funeral; that was torture for the both of us.

"Rose," Thalia's parents were the last to speak to me, and I knew they only did for her sake. They hate me. "We now know that you loved her..."

*"NOW?"*

Thalia spoke in disbelief as she listened to her parents. She'd been talking throughout every conversion between her family and myself.

"And we realize that you were happy with her..."

*"Oh, NOW you realize?!"*

"But we believe that because of you, our daughter is going to Hell."

*"What. The. Fuck."*

I had been more than used to conversations like these with Thalia's parents, but they made sure that Thalia never heard a word about it. That being said, this was the first time Thalia had witnessed one of these conversations. She was pissed to say the least.

*"How can they treat her like this?! Why has Rose been taking it for all this time?! Why hasn't she tried to stand up for herself?!"*

After years of dealing with this, I finally allowed myself to defend not only her, but myself as well. I was just as angry at her parents as Thalia was, and I felt as though I had to finally put my foot down. "If that is what you believe, then so be it. However, if I were to even believe your Hell existed, I would know that she wouldn't be there. She may never have seen what you truly believed of her or myself, but she never deserved such disrespectful parents as you. I'm sorry for the loss of your daughter, but I'm also sorry that she had to die for you to see that I truly loved her and wished to best for her."

I left. I simply walked away from the grave and over to my car. Thalia followed me. I found this to be rather ironic because I'd always followed her when she was alive. As I got into the driver's seat of the car, Thalia sat in the passenger's. That's when I broke. Tears flowed down my cheeks, and I hung my head as I cried. She watched me cry for her, and I even felt her hand on my cheek. I didn't look at her. I couldn't allow myself to reveal the fact that I could see her, hear her.

Why? Why couldn't I reveal this information to the dead; especially those who I loved? I never knew why. Was it because of the people who profit off of this curse? Or because the spirit would attach itself to this world and not move on? I only knew of what I shouldn't do, and it was torture.

*"I know you see me. Come on Rose, I'm here."*

I know that one day I'm going to break.
