"Jesus *FUCK*!" If I could gag, I would. A dead body, torn and ribboned like a frayed cloth doll dipped in scarlet lay discarded in a cheap motel room.

A woman steps out of a shower, her hair up in a towel and no other apparent form of modesty, save for the steam that rises from her skin. I, out of a shame that she didn't seeming have herself, didn't look, not that I had to- I knew who she was. 

And by God, what an utter hatter she is. This one included, she's killed 32 people, each one getting more and more... exotic. Now, I have tried- I did- I tried to be the tall, scary, stoic Death that people tend to think of, but this is just horrific. Genuinely, as a man (or... whatever) who roams the fields of war and stalks the hospital wards, I have never seen such *undoing* done with such attention to detail.

"Do.. You like It? I worked Very Hard to Make this Special for Us." She said. She came around me, gently gliding her finger across my black robe, pushing in slightly to feel the contours of my bones. 

"Wha- If I may be *so bold* as to ask, WHY?" 

"Well, I just Wanted to See You again." She said, just barely above a whisper. 

"This is too far. You know you're going to Hell for this?"

"I was going to hell anyways. But I don't have to go just yet. We can just stay here... for tonight."  I try to reply but she cuts me off before I can. "Every time I see you, you only show up for a second and wander off with some poor soul!"

"Yeah, because you killed them! Because that's my job!" 

She gives me a pout and pulls herself closer to me.

"Well, can't you take a break from your job for once?" She protests. "I thought Love was supposed to be able to conquer Death! For one night, can't it just be you and me?" 

I look down at her for the first time tonight and shake my head.

"Why do you think I'm here to begin with?" As I point to her body, torn and ribboned on the bed.
