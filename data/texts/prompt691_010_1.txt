Light doesn't come easily to the sleeping, especially when your eyes have been frozen shut for a millennia. 

&#x200B;

While most of us had become accustomed to the idea of dreamlessly sleeping for a thousand years, for me it always seemed... heartless. When you're asleep that long, waking up afterwards is less like waking up, and more like an afterlife. A dream at least ties you down, makes you remember where you came from, so to speak. 

But no dream? You might've woken up in... 

Heaven?

Hell?

Whose to say you didn't die in your sleep, and now you're living in some weird, screwed up purgatory, where nothing matters. You don't matter, I sure as hell don't matter. And now that we've all gone and died, we're free do do whatever we want. Living is only worth a damn because of consequences. 

&#x200B;

You do things -- or \*don't\* do things, because of how people around you react. What I find, however, what I \*found\* is that when everyone you've ever known has died a thousand years ago, you don't really give a damn about what you do. Especially since the idea of 'people' and 'human' isn't really a thing anymore. 

&#x200B;

I remember this one guy -- Bucky -- some drunk living a few miles outside the facility -- he always went around hitting on the ladies at the bar we would frequent after shift. He never really got anywhere. "Who cares?" he would say. "Never gonna see em again, so what I do tonight don't matter."

&#x200B;

He was wise that way. Hell, maybe that's what confidence is -- just waking up out of cyrosleep to see some big purple lookin' thing gently grabbing your arms, \*clicking\*. Pretty soon you figure nothing ever matters. 

&#x200B;

That's the thing I never got over. The \*clicking\*. It's so damn annoying. Imagine -- years and years of only hearing \*tapping\*, only hearing things hit the floor. 

&#x200B;

God, (though he clearly doesn't exist in the current state of affairs) help me.

&#x200B;

Anyway. 

&#x200B;

So I wake up after a thousand or so years, to the \*clicking\*. Incessant. Nonstop. Waking up from cyro isn't so exciting -- you just kinda lie there until you can move things, and then you... move. It gets a bit more complicated when you're surrounded by a bunch of purple lookin' aliens, all \*clicking\*.  They weren't so bad looking -- hell, They looked like lean, purple humans, perhaps with cat-eyes. Real pretty cat eyes that kinda glow when they're looking at you.

&#x200B;

Anyway, eventually the purps figure I can't understand a word, so they start pointing to some pictures of real beautiful looking things that -- last I checked -- were about to wipe out the human race. I'm talking white skin, golden eyes, flowing, silky hair -- when they first came around here, we thought they were angels. After they started ripping people's guts out through their mouth, we learned real quick that they weren't. But still. Their beauty was confounding. Have you ever fought an angel? Even if you win, it makes you feel like shit afterwards.

&#x200B;

And we didn't win, not from the looks of it. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, after a good fifteen minutes of the goddamn \*clicks\*, I get the gist. We lost. The Angels pretty much won, and the cat-eyed things tried to colonize the earth after us, and now the Angels are back. The clickers want me to help them. Neato. Wake up the forty or so jarheads that should be sleeping next to me, and we should be all good. 

&#x200B;

Except they're not there. After walking around the facility for a few minutes, it became apparent that wherever the jarheads were, they \*definitely\* weren't around. Well great. I was supposed to snag a beer with them afterwards too. 

&#x200B;

Bastards.

&#x200B;

The purple people are still lookin' at me, wondering what to do -- and what \*can\* I do? I'm no soldier, I'm a janitor. Not a good one either. Most days, I'd come home covered in filth and slime from cleaning. Don't ask. I don't wanna talk about where the slime comes from. 

&#x200B;

So I figure, well, I'd better get this shit over quick, die, and then get away from all the goddamn clicking, right?

&#x200B;

So while I'm walking around, I hear that telltale \*fweee--bahhh\* of an Angel coming in, and lo and behold -- the purple guys scatter, all ducking around and running away from me. So much for faith in their product.

&#x200B;

But regardless,  I'm just waiting for the end and that blissful silence -- maybe I'm still a bit woozy from cyro, when I'm face to face with an Angel. Breathtaking. Absolutely beautiful. Marble skin, with dark veins running through, golden eyes that coldly regard you -- me. Wings, too. Jagged, dagger-like wings that they used to skewer whole families through with. 

&#x200B;

This one, a female looking one, stops, cocks her head to regard me curiously -- It's probably been centuries since they've seen a human.  She walks up towards me, silver hands reaching out, about to grab.

&#x200B;

I coughed then. Didn't really want to spoil the moment, not really, and certainly didn't mean no disrespect either. Some say it's rude to not cover a cough, but any human that woulda been offended died long long ago. But I had a tickle, and well, I didn't wanna die with my last thought being about a cough I easily coulda taken. Might as well go out being as comfortable as possible, right?

&#x200B;

But either way, that little cough stopped the Angel in its tracks. Tiny black dots, all over her front. She stopped walking, hell, even stumbled backwards, clawing at the little dots. 

&#x200B;

They were steaming, smoking, charring her marble skin. Soon enough, with a final wail, she collapsed, twitching, onto the floor.

&#x200B;

I stared at her, then gently raised a hand to my mouth and coughed again. 

&#x200B;

Guess in all those centuries since they'd won the earth the damn Angels hadn't thought to update their vaccination procedures. From behind me, the cat-eyes were clicking up a storm. 

&#x200B;

"Easy," I said, pointing to my hand. "I think I know what to do."

&#x200B;

I walked back into the dilapidated bunker, looking for my old pair of overalls, my little squigee bottle of windex. Lord knows how many bodily fluids I could fit in that thing, and last I'd checked my overalls had been filthy. 

&#x200B;

Just another different kind of cleaning, with another kind of pest.
