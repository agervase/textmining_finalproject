*What’s the saying? You either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.*

*Hah, I wish I could tell you how true that was. I have lived countless lifetimes. Over and over. However, it’s not the romanticized immortality. No. I age, my body decays. Sometimes i’m murdered. Sometimes I die by accident in childhood. You see, I am born over and over. The moment my body dies, my mind is transported into the next babe to be born. It was interesting. Fun even the first few times. Oh, the wonders I could tell you about living in the age of enlightenment, or being at the forefront technological advancements. Amazing really. But then there were things like the atomic bomb, the countless wars, the hunger, the disease.* 

*I’ve been all those people. I’ve been male, female, black, white, Native American, Indian, Chinese… I could go on and on. I remember each lifetime. I remember each detail. The people I’ve loved. The people I’ve killed. I remember everything.* 

*You would think being reborn with all these memories you would be able to change the fate of humanity. I’ve tried. I really have. At one point I even considered myself a prophet or a god. But a god could change things. And I haven’t been able to. I’ve given up. On myself. On humanity.*

*Let me tell you a story. About a hero. Long ago, in a world so different from today, that it seems like a fairytale. But it’s not. It’s my first life. I remember an old shaman woman granting me the gift of life. So that I may live when others would die. Hah. Oh, our people were at war with another tribe, can you imagine? I went into battle, a young man full of life and more than eager to prove myself. Ran into battle, protected by the shaman’s magic. I believed in magic then. You know what happened? I was run through with a sword before I even killed my first enemy. The blood poured, and oh, the pain. It was awful really. And then, warmth, and light. I supposed that it was alright that the shaman had been wrong. I had died and gone on to the afterlife. Until, I was born into the world moments later. I had to grow up, laughs in the tribe that my first had been at war with. I saw how they were just trying to get more food. How neither tribe was actually in the right.* 

*And it went on. Over and over. The same stories. The same problems. I tried so hard to fix them. I really did. But they persisted.* 

*Sigh. I don’t want to do this. But I have to. The shaman didn’t bless me, no, she cursed me. And now you all have to suffer. If I can’t fix humanity, I can surely end it. The weapons that at first disgusted me are now my saviors. This plan has been lifetimes in the making. You could never have known. This is the first step. I know I won't succeed in killing you all in the first go, but here's the thing. I am going to die too, but I’ll be born again wherever you are. You will never know if you can trust your child. I could be him, or her. And I will continue to wipe out the remnants until at last I can rest. I can die. If there is an afterlife, I know I will suffer for what I’ve done. But, I cannot continue this existence any longer.* 

*I wish I had died a hero.* 

The man stood, and turned off the camera. He uploaded the video and sent it to every news agency, to every social media site. He spread it far and wide. Quicker than even he suspected it was everywhere. He laid down in his bed. Tomorrow, he would detonate the bombs and then the real work would start.
