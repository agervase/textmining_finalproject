The detective took a long drink from his mug. The once piping coffee from earlier had since turned to lukewarm sludge. It had already been a long day, and was shaping up to be a long night. 

"I don't get it." He sighed. "It has to be the gardener, but his alibi is rock solid."

"What's to get? The kid is a psychopath. He needs to be locked up. Throw away the key." His partner replied miming locking a door and then, using his best Kobe impression, pretended to throw the imaginary key in the trash can. 

Bill rolled his eyes and chewed the butt of the cigarette that dangled from his mouth. 

"It just doesn't make sense, Marcus. I mean, here is this kid. Everyone loves him. Eagle Scout. Salutatorian. He is supposed to be heading off to college. Ya know. Drink, hang out with girls, get a degree. But here he is. Sitting with that shit eating grin. Does he even know that 13 people, two dogs, and three cats were all killed in the last three hours? Forensics are pretty certain the scythe he used to kill the fish was used in the rest of the killings." Bill said. 

"Koi."

"What?" 

"Koi. It's the type of fish he killed." Explained Marcus. "It's like a big goldfish."

"How the hell do you know that? You a fish expert all of a sudden?" 

"No. Not at all. My aunt Cindy used to keep koi fish in her pond out in Allentown. I went once as a kid and was like 'Those goldfish are huge!' She slapped the back of my head and said those are Koi fish you idiot. I never liked aunt Cindy come to think of it."

"Alright alright, I got it. Christ Marcus, always with the stories. So like I said. Killing the fi... uh, *Koi* fish. Why that? What was the point?"

"Maybe it was some type of prank.  I might have done the same thing as a kid if someone gave me a scythe."

"Or maybe the old man put him up to it. They knew each other, after all. But if that was the case why would the old man want the kid to kill a giant goldfish?" 

"Koi fish" 

Bill stared at Marcus, rubbed his neck and sighed. 

"As I was saying, the old man knew the other victims and, in the case of the animals, knew the owners. But the koi fish.  What is the motive there? We're missing something."

"That's why it wasn't the old man. It was the kid. He's a looney. Not worth thinking about it past that. Leave that to the psychologists.  We just need a confession. That's all. I know it wasn't the gardener. That guy seemed perfectly normal. This kid gives me the creeps. He just keeps smiling."

"Kill a fish with a scythe, dressed like the fuckin' grim reaper.  That is a little more than slightly odd. Maybe you're right. Let's get to it. We've let the kid sit it out alone in there long enough. Let's see what he has to say."

"Alright." 

Bill flicked the cigarette butt in the trash, slugged back the last of his coffee, and pulled his pants up by the belt. Marcus stood up and put his badge back on his belt and picked a wedgie. 

"You stay here." Bill instructed Marcus. "Let me try alone first. Two cops might be a little too intimidating."

"You're the lead here. Whatever you say." Marcus walked over to the one way mirror. "I'll hang out in here. Give me the sign if you want me to come in."

He opened the door to the interrogation room and the adolescent looked back up at him. Puberty has just begun to set in, the pimples dotting his forehead and chin as evidence. 

"Hello officers!" He said. The smile never once leaving his face. "What's up?"

"Listen Chase, we are just scratching our heads here. Why did you kill that goldfish?"

"You mean the *koi* fish?" He asked, an innocent look on his face. 

Bill glanced at the mirror where Marcus was and imagined him standing behind it nodding in agreement. 

"Right. The *koi* fish.  Why?"

Chase looked at them both. "Well, cuz it was sick. It was it's time to go."

"What do you mean it's time to go?" 

"Well, it was time for it to move on to the next life. It was on the verge of death. I saw it swimming funny when I went to the mall last week. I know a thin or two about fish. I keep them at home."

"Chase, do you know why your here?" Bill questioned. 

"Yea because of the fish."

"Right, but..." Bill began. 

"And the people." Chase cut him off. "And the dogs. And the cats. Ohhhh and the cow on that dairy farm off of interstate 72."

Bill couldn't believe what he was hearing. He stared at the kid. It still didn't rule out the old man. Bill knew he was somehow behind this. He pressed on. 

"Chase. We know you got the scythe from Mr. Peterson. He told us he gave it to you.  Tell us what really happened.  Are you covering for him?"

"Yea. How did you know? Did he tell you?"

Anger and confusion flooded over Bill. He had seen some terrible crimes in his time on the force, but why anyone would make a kid do those horrible things was unforgivable. 

"No he didn't. But I thought so. Good kid like yourself wouldn't just do that. I don't understand why. Why did you? How did he make you?"

"Make me? No no. He said he couldn't handle his job anymore. He gave me his scythe. It's actually quite he honor. I couldn't believe he picked me."

"His job? What do you mean?" Bill asked. 

"Death."

"What?" 

"The grim reaper.  It's not an easy job but someone has to do it. It's really a privilege to help all those poor souls move to the other side."

"Chase. Mr. Peterson is a part time gardener. What are you talking about?"

"Oh..."
