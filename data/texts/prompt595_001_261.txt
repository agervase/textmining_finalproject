*Just one more post, then I'll head to bed.  So many purple links.  The only blue links are from r/TIL, but seriously, who actually opens those?"*

I take a sip of my coffee, struggling to work up the motivation to walk 10 feet to my bed.

*Perhaps, I'll browse r/new for a bit.  I mean someone has to do it, right?  Maybe I'll get a top comment this time. *

Scrolling down, I nearly missed it.  "Aliens Invade!  Redditors Unite!"  

*PFFFT!  Just some karma whore, I'm sure of it.*

A quick look at the comment history and I see 3,423 post karma, but no 1 year trophy.  

*Alright, u/Lightly_Saltedd, What do you have to say?*  

Aliens have invaded all of the world's capitals and are demanding information.  At the time of this post no one had yet found out what they wanted.  I refresh the page and see that the article has been updated.  Aliens have begun slaughtering people they find useless to their cause.  All of the world leaders and their families are dead, and they've moved on to entire populations, save for some.  Nobody understands why.  Maybe they were lucky.  Maybe they planned ahead.  Maybe they know something everyone else didn't.  Either way, one thing is certain: it wasn't by accident. 

Stunned, I rush to the window.  Outside it's eerie and quiet.  Cars are empty, the streets are abandoned, and there are clothes all over the place.  I'm still here, but why?  I have to find answers.

I head back to my computer and refresh the page.  Hundreds of new posts have popped up, all reporting on the story, but one in particular catches my eye.

**"We are responsible for the decimation of your species.  If you are reading this, you've been left alive for a reason.  AUA."**

My hands are shaking so violently I can barely type, but I must get the question out.  

*"Why have you left us alive?"*

**Because within this userbase is the answer to our question.**

*What do you want to know?*

**What's inside the safe?**
