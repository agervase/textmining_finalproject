"Fuck off!" I yelled at the computer screen as it glitched...I hadn't saved my progress in the game I had been playing for hours... I was almost at the end too.

"Victor?" My sister called from the living room. 'What now?' I thought angrily.
"What!" I yelled back.
"Did your internet go down too?" She replied.
"Ya, Why? Yours too?" I asked, standing up from my desk and walking out into the hallway. 
"Mine just shut down." she said, sounding rather confused. I could here the T.V. still on downstairs, and the radio was playing the kitchen. I started my way down the spiral staircase, every time I walked down those stairs it reminded me of when I was a kid and I would slide down the banister. My Mom hated when I did that. At the bottom I turned the corner and saw Julie restarting her computer.

"What do you think happened?" She asked as she saw my enter the living room.
"How the Hell should I know?" I replied.
"Jeez no need to be a dick about it, you're the tech expert here." She said back rudely.

Then the T.V. screen went black and the sound that it made when there was a tornado warning or something came on. We both turned to look at it, the weather had been great all week, no warnings or advisories. The radio in the kitchen went to static at the same time. We assumed there was something going on with the cable and I went into the kitchen to turn it off. However as I walked into the room, a broadcast began playing and it caught my attention.

"EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY, GET TO HIGH GROUND. EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY, GET TO HIGH GROUND." 

I didn't know what to think, then Julie called my name sounding confused and a little worried. I ran back into the living room to see her standing in front of the T.V. She pointed at the screen and I looked. The screen was red and there was text scrolling along the top in capital letters.

"STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE. STAY INDOORS AND DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE." 

Then an AI voice of a woman came through saying the same message repeatedly. 
 
"Vic? Victor what is this?" She asked, clearly bothered by the message. 
"I don't no Jules...but the radio just broadcast something else, it said Evacuate immediately and to get to high ground." I replied. I thought some hackers had maybe gotten through the firewall at our cable company. Then the power went out and we heard a huge BANG, like something had exploded or a building had collapsed. Julie jumped and all the color in her face disappeared.

"Victor! What was that?" She yelled as she ran over to me and grabbed my hand. "Fuck sake Julie stop asking me questions I'm just as confused as you!" I yelled back, unable to keep the fear out of my voice. "Victor, I'm scared. What's happening...What do we do?" She asked. I wished I could give her an answer but I was trying to listen to everything around us.

"Call Mom. See if the phones are working and call her, see where she is. It might just be a down power line or something." I said, as calmly as I could.
Julie grabbed the cordless phone from the table in by the T.V. and pressed the talk button to check for a dial tone. 
"It's dead." She said. "Try your cell." I replied.
I reached in my own pocket and realized I had left my phone upstairs by my computer. No point going up for it, if her's didn't work, I doubted that mine would be any different.

Scrolling through the contacts list, she found our Mom's number and pressed call. It didn't ring. Instead it made the same air raid siren sound that had played through the T.V. I could hear it loudly just standing beside her. Then she took the phone from her ear and pressed speaker phone.

"What the fuck is happening." I said quietly. It wasn't a question so much as a statement. "I think we should-" I started but Julie interrupted me. "Shhh! Listen." 

We stood motionless in the living room, listening to several things happening at once. The message had been heard by our neighbors, clearly, and it seemed that some were in dispute about which message to abide by. The radio said get out and to high ground, but the phone and the T.V. said otherwise. It sounded like several of the families next on our street had decided to evacuate. We heard the unnerving shouts of people urging others to get in the car, or to leave the cat and get out. Car doors slammed shut and engines turned on, tires screeched as they burst into life and pulled out of driveways.

We heard voices screaming at others to stay in the house, or to get in the basement. Windows were slamming shut and the general chaos outside had us desperately wanting to look outside and see what was happening. Julie and I glanced at eachother, reading the others minds, we darted towards the big window in the living room and carefully pulled back the curtains. It was pitch black outside...i don't think I had ever seen a darkness as dark as that. 
The cars that had driven down the street suddenly halted, we couldn't see it, but we heard it. along with many other traumatic sounds. It was like 17 vehicles had smashed into one another, followed by terrified screams. 
The a flash of white hot light ripped the sky in two and Julie screamed. we both jumped back from the window, grabbing each others hands.

Then we heard people running from all directions and yelling, crying, screaming. "GET IN! GET BACK IN THE HOUSE! LOCK THE DOORS AND GET IN THE CLOSET!" Julie looked at me, even in the pitch black I could imagine the look of fright on her face. Her palm was sweating and she was squeezing my hand tighter than I could have ever imagined. 

"That was Francis." She whispered. She was right. Our neighbor, Francis St.Germain. He had a wife and 2 kids and it was clearly his voice yelling right across the street. He had always invited us over in the summer to go swimming in his pool when it was sweltering hot out. Our dad and him would sit in Francis' garage and drink beer on Friday nights, listening to classic rock like Alice Cooper and AC/DC. 

"FRANCIS! GET IN! LEAVE IT AND GET IN THE HOUSE!" His wife Joan was heard shouting now. More and more frantic her voice became and we heard the sound of thier garage door banging shut. 
"FRANCIS! THEY'RE COMING PLEASE!"
"GET IN JOAN! SHUT THE FUCKING DOOR GET IN!" He yelled back.
"FRANCIS!" Joan screamed. The terror in her voice was enough to freeze our blood and stop our breath. Then we heard the unmistakable sound of Francis screaming, followed by a gunshot. Then another gun shot and breaking glass. 
We could hear Joan scream from somewhere inside their house, and the screams of the kids, Riley and Patrick. 

My adrenaline kicked in and I grabbed Julie and pulled her away from the window and over to our basement door. "Get in." I said forcefully. "But- Victor NO!" She began. "Shut-up Julie, do as I say, get down there now." 
"Victor you come too, you need to come too I'm scared!" She whispered, clutching at the front of my shirt. "DO IT!" I yelled and she began to cry. "Julie, listen to me. I need to lock the doors and windows. Get downstairs, I will be there in a minute." I said, trying to sound reassuring, though I was terrified too.
"I'm not going without you." She replied. "JULIE GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT NOW!" I yelled, and then I heard the sound of breaking glass from somewhere above us. One of the bedroom windows for sure. 

We both stopped talking immediately and I shoved her down the stairs. She grabbed the railing, keeping herself from falling and I ran into the kitchen to the door that opened to our garage. I could hear Julie sobbing on the stairs, stubbornly not moving. We had always been very close Julie and I. She was only a year younger than me and we had done everything together. She was my best friend up until the last semester at school. There was a girl that I had always really liked, and that year she started to notice me too. I had gone on my first date, had my first kiss, gone to my first dance. 
Julie had been jealous because I was spending more and more time with Alexis, and less and less time with her. 

Julie had become more reclusive than usual and I knew she was feeling left out. But I was a 16 year old kid with a crush and I couldn't help it. I loved my sister, but I needed to do somethings without her.
