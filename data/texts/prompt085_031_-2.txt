Subway was out of flatbread, so i had to get italian for a dollar cheaper.Handed the 5 dollars, and got  dollar back, then, as clear as day, 5 billion. Puzzled, i see a homeless man outside. I hand him the dollar.

When he handed me the dollar, he was gawking at his watch.
"5 billion? How do i save all those people with some italian bread?"
Thinking nothing of it, i walk inside a cvs and buy medicine, for the illness these rats have given me. 

Remembering my past. How it should have gone. How all the riches should have been flowing. But then, one night, after a bar day, i got arrested for assault. They took everything, I said to myself as tears went down my face. 

I bought the medicine, and handed the money to the cashier.

The sobbing homeless handed me the money, and i went into a 7/11 for a lottery ticket. Funds were low, and i needed to hit the pot. I bought the ticket, and watched drawing night. I couldnt believe it, i was puzzled. I would be moving from my tatted apartment complex, to a mansion, in the hills. What about the homless man. I felt bad, his money meant my success, i went out to my job, and found the man. I said." Meet me here monday, i have a surprise." As i held the ticket. He seems perplexed, then happy, then ecstatic.

He held the ticket. I survived, barely, and couldnt get over those poor rats, now long gone for some homeless persons meal. Monday came. I got a check for 500 million. Bought a house, led my life, bought a company for health, energy, and water. I made innovations, inventions, and all other things. Places flourished, the world changed, and billions were saved. Now, i wonder what 5 billion meant now.
