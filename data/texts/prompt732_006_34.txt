Eons ago, during an age unrecorded by man or other creature, the Leviathans came. They emerged from the sea every decade, casting an eternal darkness wherever they step foot on. The ones who didn't flee in utter terror found it hard to breath, and then realized that the air had turned to acid. Those with spells or enchanted weapons stood little chance, their armor was thicker than the tallest of trees and harder than a mountain. The legends, from various oral traditions, claim that a vast army had finally put the threat down. In that age, the Leviathans were just stories.

Then, something awoke them. In the mining regions of Alaska, the Leviathans once again rose from their slumber, enraged that their tombs were invaded by the constant drilling of mankind. They arose, and the mountains of fire on their backs created a smog that could be seen even from space. People thought it was an oil refinery accident, until the firefighters and police sent there were slaughtered. The Leviathan threat lived once again.

 Once again, the Dread King Cranthar would lead his people to destroy the pests. He had seen them run thousands of times. He knew how they fought, shield walls or spaced spearmen supported by mages who would filter the air. And 9 out of 10 times, they were unstoppable. 

&#x200B;

"The infestation will once again be culled!" Cranthar bellowed to his legion in the ashy air, followed by a roar of approval. "They have become weak, these humans. They have forgotten not only us, but magic as well." They had laughed, magic was the only thing to prolong the human's existence if they got close. And with no more magic, meant that there were no more of those pesky heroes with their enchanted blades. Now, finally, the Leviathans were truly immortal.

5 miles away, a team of US Army reconnaissance personnel had already sent the coordinates of the Leviathans back to the base's artillery battery commanders. Another 8 miles away lay several dozen heavy guns, 155mm Howitzers, with their crews trying to defend themselves against the February winds. It had been a week since the President had ordered a military taskforce against the new threats, and today each Leviathan was about to see what humanity had done since abandoning magic.

&#x200B;

The crewmen rushed to their guns once the order was issued, and in under a minute each and every Howitzer, all capable of annihilating a house.

Cranthar had thought a storm had started with so much thunder in the air. Several seconds later, a the world turned into fire and smoke. Two Leviathans were destroyed, one had a gapping hole in its chest while the other lost most of its head. Before anyone had time to react, several more strikes hit them. Dust was thrown up in the air, and multiple shockwaves threw scores of Leviathans to the ground. Cranthar himself recieved a blow, dozens of pieces of shrapnel from the shell embeded themselves into his eye. The Dread King roared in pain, yet he couldn't even hear himself or even the blasts. The incredible force hit the Leviathans again and again, and more of Cranthar's kind were ripped apart. 

&#x200B;

It lasted for little over a minute. Helicopter flown troops later arrived onto the scene. The survivors were either too shocked or wounded to put up any resistance. Cranthar couldn't even tell what was happening by then, his body felt too numb, and his other senses were gone. The air didn't smell of volcanic victory anymore, but of his own dead kin.
