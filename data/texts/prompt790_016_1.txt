She was right in front of me, that who was calling herself "the angel of death": a frail figure who transcend the numbers of age and the concept of senescence. No matter how decayed her body might have seemed, she radiated with the unparalleled strength vitality of a 60 year old heavy smoker fueling on the vapors of ethanol. Complementary to this analogy was her apparel of somewhat old cheap clothes with even cheaper fake fur that you get at thrift stores, a seemingly everlasting cigarette and a flask of what I assumed was the finest product of any hillbilly's backyard. 

She inhaled from her cigarette for a moment before finally proceeding to speak again:

You people *always* give me that same look, that *same* exact look, lemme tell ya; it never gets old!

She laughed to herself with a sound that could only be described as a mix between an old cat's roar, an old barnyard door and sandpaper. She again took a moment to refuel her lungs with nicotine before pursing:

You know you're fucked in here, right kid?

I silently nodded while she continued:

Your kidnappers might be messin' around with ya for a while now, but once they decide to really get goin' at it, you're fucked like there's no tomorrow; it'll get real messy real quick. Now I'm not one to usually mess around with killing people, but I got a bet on ya, kid, and believe me I'm not gonna lose that one!

I look at her with uncertainty as she took another breath from the cigarette:

Ya see, kid, it's fucking boring in the hall of gods up there, so we spice it up by betting our youth and beauty on very healthy folks like you to see how long ya gonna last. Lemme tell ya, kid, you had that potential to get past your hundreds: Always runnin', always meditatin' and eatin' and all that fancy shit, your genes were top notch and you had no money trouble! Then..

Inhaling deeper, she continued:

Then these fuckin' idiots decided to kidnap ya! Now, you get one month at most before they get bored and kill you and I'm not gonna let that happen!

Her words shook me with a chill that i had not felt since... that night; she nodded in agreement:

Destiny's up there lookin' at the everything and makin' sure that no one rigs the game, but she does a shitty job, lemme tell ya, so you know what, kid?

She took a quick sip of smoke as she got up and put a hand on my shoulder:

Fuck destiny. I'm gettin' ya out of here!

As she said those words, the two men came and immediately saw the additional old woman. With the snap of her fingers, a small blast of light and smoke rendered them both unconscious. With a wilted hand, she touched the bars who instantly wrinkled away from her, leaving enough space for us to escape. After traversing the small tunnel brightened by the evergrowing light of day, she opened the door leading out:

Alright, kid, ya free now. I'm callin' the cops to get these bastards; here, take this.

She handed me an wrinkled and yellowed paper with names and numbers on it:

Here's a number for a therapist and a bunch of things that might help you gettin' back on ya feet. On that note, I'm off and away!

She paused for an brief moment before adding one more thing: 

Oh, and while you're at it, you should drink a glass of wine once in a while; Ive heard it's good for the heart!

She winked at me, as she disappeared in a instant, leaving only the songs of the birds and the wind of the forest to fill the empty void of the country road ahead of me. As the songs of the birds gave way to the sirens of the police cars, I knew my story had just begun.
