The fighting had raged for mere hours before everything came crashing down. Their forces were immeasurable, their weapons far beyond humanity's. It was hardly a valiant effort, anything any military tried met with catastrophic failure in minutes.   
  
General Dillian stood on the bow of the ship, he couldn't find the answers for the hundreds of questions that ran by him from the group surrounding him. They were out of options, he knew it, but he refused to let humanity fall to an alien species, to be left at their mercy.  
  
*"Fuck it."* The General said, as the alien mothership came in to land. *"Summon Cthulhu."*  
  
Everyone around him went silent. Hairs stood on end from the mere mention of its name.   
*"S-Sir..."*  
One of them spoke,  *"We won't be able to control-"*  
  
*"I don't give a damn about control. We're on a losing battle, but the war isn't over."* The General snapped. He was well-aware of the consequences. Every treaty that had been formed around the subject stated that The Old Gods would only be used in catastrophic situations as a matter of self-destruction to defeat an enemy... this was such situation.  
  
Everyone hesitated, their hearts were certainly full of fear. They collected their Old Ones manuals, flipping to the page of Cthulhu. In the distance, sirens could be heard. They had a matter of minutes before everything would be over.  
  
*"Ph'nglui..."* The captain said in a shaken voice. Everyone repeated after him.  
*"...mglw'nafh... Cthulhu... R'lyeh... wgah'nagl fhtagn!"*  
They finished. Everyone went cold, nothing happened for a couple seconds. Just as they thought to start again, the waves parted, and the large, eldritch being had arrived.   
  
Their worst fears, ones they didn't even know they bore, were instantly recognised. On the outside, Cthulhu raged, swiping, thrashing, attacking every ship. They opened fire, but the Old God stood strong.  
  
On the inside, every man who found himself gazing upon Cthulhu had become an empty husk of their former selves.   
  
Madness had fallen.
