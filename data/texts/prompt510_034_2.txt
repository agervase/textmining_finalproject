"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." He thought as he moved closer to her. "I must speak to her." He didn't understand it but the way she looked drew him in. "Hello, my name is Sam" He said confidently. "Hi, I'm Angel." From then on they would have the deepest conversations that he couldn't have with any one else.
He fell in love with her. And with his life. 

She didn't have a phone so they would always agree to meet that the very spot he had first seen her. Life only got better and he would fall for her more each day as she some how would look all the more beautiful. 

One day as they sat and had lunch out side of they're favorite restaurant. A man walking by caught a glimpse of Angels face and ran for dear life! Screaming "I don't want to die!" Running straight into a busy intersection and being struck by a car. 

This made him think. "That poor fellow. I guess everyone has their time.." 

Through he course of the next few months Sam grew tired and week. He then decided it was time to see a doctor. After several tests the conclusion was this: "you have terminal brain cancer" he was given AT LEAST 6 months to live. 

He didn't know how to break the news to Angel so he put it off and ignored the fact that he was dying. He continued to enjoy life and his time with her. As time grew thin he became more and more frightened with dying. He had to tell her. So when they met up at their usual spot he couldn't find her. Just a tall skinny looking old woman dressed in all black standing where Angel usually would. 

He then asked her "have you seen a young woman about mid-twenties?" "No Sam, I haven't" her voice chilled him to the core and made him feel all the more ill. He looked at her face and she looked as she was only skin and bone. "Do I kn-" he tried to speak but she put her hand on his shoulder and said "I am Angel.. Angel of death"
