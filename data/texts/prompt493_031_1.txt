Your heart is beating. 

Way too fast. 

Fuck. You gasp and grip your chest, fingers shaking and stare down at your skin. It remains as young as it did all two centuries ago when you promised Hebe that. 

It should have been obvious to be honest. But as they say, love is blind. 

It blinded you and now you're never going to die. And you also have eternal youth due to a tryst with the goddess of eternal youth granting you that in exchange for her life. You were the one who was supposed to die. Not her. 

She was an angel. An actual goddess and you were nothing compared to her.  Just a human. Who was probably not going to survive that surgery but you did. Still baffles the medical community and you had to vanish from the face of the world because people kept on looking to do a study on you. 

You've changed names and hair and actually know how to use make up on yourself so many times now you're not sure if you've ever been the same since she died for you.

...Hebe. Your eyes wander to the plants outside your window in the courtyard. It's a plant that originates from New Zealand named after her. It was fitting in a way, she told you her favourite colour was purple and green. You did blanch at first from the weird match but now you can see the beauty of it in them.

Sighing, you ran your fingers through your hair pretending it was hers and closed your eyes. 

Time to get out of bed and go live your life as 'Heracles', an archeologist.

  You know she'd probably hate you for using an old lover's name of hers but you kind of wants this life to be more symbolic towards her. What better way than this you suppose.
