"So, what's yer favorite kind of animal?" The blacksmith had asked Rowan as he had noticed her attention was on the stray cat that liked to hang around the shop. Rowan had been crouched down with her hand outstretched so that the cat would accept her presence. She didn't bother to look at the blacksmith as she absentmindedly answered, "I think me favorite would be a dragon."

"Dragons? I would've thought that cats were the answer!" The blacksmith laughed heartily as he stepped back to pick up the order of nails that Rowan came to pick up. "Here ya go, lass. Building something big?"

"Uh... aye," Rowan answered as she stood up to grab the crate of nails, "Father's building a new  coop for the chickens. Foxes broke into the last one."

"Are ye sure it ain't those dragons ya love so much?" The blacksmith jokingly asked. His expression showed amusement and disbelief in her claims. Rowan was about to answer when she'd been interrupted by the cat she was just paying attention to, as it was now meowing at her as it rubbed up against her shoes.

"Oi..." She finally looked up to the blacksmith, only to be greeted by a shocked and fearful expression. The blacksmith's eyes were wide and his pipe had fallen from his mouth to the ground. Confused, Rowan turned her head to see what the blacksmith was afraid of.

A dragon as big as a small cottage stood behind her. She immediately realized that she knew this dragon, and it remembered her. Suddenly, she found herself being carried off by the dragon. She may have been startled, but she wasn't afraid. Why? Because this was not the first time this had happened.

The moment the dragon landed, she gave it a questioning glare. "Why must ye always carry me off when I'm doing somethin'?"

The dragon huffed and stepped away from Rowan for a moment.

"You were jealous of that cat, weren't you?"
