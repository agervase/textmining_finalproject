I peered our the window of my condo, to see two hooded figures outside with the “glow” that all the other immortals have. The damn federation is back.

I put some clothes on and walked outside to them. “What the hell do you want know”

“We have a request from Silth for you to come to court in the federation”

“You know I’m.not gunna go, I don’t have to”

“Come one man, what you’re doing is fully against the Federations laws”

“The federation doesn’t rule over me, I don’t choose to be there.” 

“Well, you gotta stop doing shit! Don’t try to change history you shouldn’t butt in”

“I think I’ll do what I want. Know get off my property before I call the police”

“They don’t do anything”

“JUST LEAVE”

Rufus jumped up on my lap. The tv blurted some news about some war I started. I chuckled to myself at the mention. I turned it off and went over to the smoke detector. After some prying it opened and revealed a microphone and a small camera. The f*cking government tapped me again. Those idiots thought I wouldn’t notice. 

I heard a knock at the door just then. Shit shit shit shit shit. The feds. I peeked our the eyehole. False alarm. It’s just Caitlin. I opened the door for her and locked it after. 

“Honey they tapped us again” I said

“Why can’t you just follow the law Steve” she replied “Talk to the federation”

“They hate me. I don’t want to be confined to their laws, I want to be able to do what I want”

“Everyone else hates you, what are you gunna do when the humans all die out and all that’s left is the federation. “

“I don’t know honey. I just.. they don’t let me have fun. They want to stay out of everything and not let us help”

“Then you go to them and convince them to let you help”

“Fine. I’ll go to one meeting with you but that’s IT”

“The counsel calls for all members to be seated and wait for the meeting to begin” They said. Then I burst through the doors. Heads turned and murmurs started.

“Sorry I’m late”
