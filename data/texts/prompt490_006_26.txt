All this would have been odd enough, but then… the mouse spoke.

“Thank you kind sir, for your most vallent rescue.”

I stared in disbelief at the tiny mouse, but the sight of blood beginning to pool on the side of the mouse’s right leg spurred me into action as I went over to my first aid kit.

I took out some stuff to clean the large cut, and began to bandage it the best I could.

I finally found my voice in the silence, “Did…you just speak just now?”

“Yes, I apologize it must be very shocking to hear one of my kind speak. As we have been barred by the great rodent council from speaking to humans.”

“Right… Okay.”

“However, I felt the need to make my gratitude known.”

“Okay? I’m guessing from the armor… and your -sword, that you went after my cat?”

“Oh you are warden over the feline, my most humble apologies, I am only meant to fight the strays that prey on my kind.” 

The mouse bowed his head in shame. “I neglected to do the proper checks, please forgive me kind sir.”

“Uh. It’s okay? My name is Patrick by the way.”

“Then my further apologies Sir Patrick, I have also found myself with my manners in remiss, my name is Vincent of the Order of the Knights, son of Victor, head of his majesties defenses.”

“Wow, that’s impressive. Uh… not to cramp your style or anything but you’re going to need a better weapon than a plastic sword if you’re going up against cats.” 

I walked over to an old sewing box I had gotten at a garage sale and picked out the longest needle and a couple of the pins.

I scooped up Vincent into my other hand and walked over to my work bench in my garage, “While you rest up, how about I make you a proper sword?”

Vincent’s face lit up like he’d just been offered the world, “I would be most grateful Sir Patrick, I have never seen a human smithy in action!”

I smiled back at him, Sir Patrick… the smithy. I could get used to that.
