"Oh, you don't look good, not good one bit, now do you?" the  young doctor took off his glasses.  
"Who are you? Where's the other doctor...? And where's your lab coat?"   
"Oi, quiet. Save your words for when you gotten more breaths... I didn't say close your mouth. Open wide and say, 'Allons-y!'"   
"Say what?" He squished my face with his hand and lit my mouth with his buzzing blue medical light in the other.    
"How long have you had these teeth?" He let go of me and placed his tiny blue light into his breast pocket.  
"How long - ?"  
"Not important. But what is important is that you get *up up up!*"  
"So, I'm okay, we're done, then?"   
"Oh no, not in the slightest, but I can give you - Mmm - about six months, give or take the coordinates."  
"Coordinates?"   
"Oh yes, yes indeed. My good assistant here, Rose..."   
"Assistant?"  
"Hello!"  
"Gah! Were you there all this time?"  
The pretty pretty blond smiled with a tiny wave.   
"... she and I will be seeing about those molars back there... being all... toothish."  
"I'm sorry, I am a bit confused?"   
"Oh, why's that?"  
"I thought this was the chiropractor."  
The odd doctor and his blond assistant exchanged looks until the doctor exclaimed, "It is! But you're bound to have some back problems when it has to carry a couple extra teeth. We just gotta get in there and rip'em out, and you got yourself half a year!"   
"Half a year? Half a year for what?"   
"To live."  
"To live?"  
"To live. But! Don't worry, Mister..."   
The assistant said, "Jeffries."   
"Mister Jeffries!"   
"That's not my name."     
"Not important. Just come back in, say, 175 days and I'll let you know if I can manage another year."  
"175 days..?"   
"It's a Tuesday. But, Miss Rose and I must be going." The doctor pulled on his brown trench coat then opened a door and held it for the assistant who walked on in. "Don't be late, Jeffries."   
"That's not my - Where are you going?"  
"Tuesday," he smiled, "don't be late," and closed the door, and a high, rusty, wheezing sound breathed from behind it then stopped.   
"What an odd man... Wait. He didn't say what time." I stood and opened the door but... it was only a closet.
