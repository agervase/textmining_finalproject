It was like being inside of a carnival fun house. Except I wasn't used to being the clown.

"This is not what I meant when I instructed you to do my work for me  P3nny-bot" I said. I was almost as impressed as I was annoyed. And I was wound up very tightly at the moment.

*"Outcome is within specified parameters, mistress Penny"* It chimed back to me in a perfect replica of my own voice. It positively dripped with faux innocence. *"Your COMMAND_SET=Pennylikeaboss(adaptive) encompasses everything needed to construct a lifelike replica of yourself"* it paused just long enough for us both to take a breath. *"Your credit limit didn't hurt either, hehe"* She turned ninety degrees and swooped over to hug her "copy". It was glaring at me like she was on her period, and I had just eaten the last bowl of Moose Tracks.

I sighed heavily. This was a mess, one I should have seen coming in all honesty. I got lazy after finishing up all the hardware. Instead of coding the A.I. myself the old fashioned way, I just uploaded my own neural map and a simple recursive learning algorithm. So it learned from me how to be me (maybe a little too well).;and then all I had to do was instruct it to go through all my stuff to get my education. She was as perfect a stand in for me as possible, so of course she got lazy too!

"Well I could argue with you about that, but I already know there is no point. You are technically correct..."

*"The only kind of correct that matters"* both P3nny bots interrupted momentarily.

"Ok...so why is P3nny^3 glaring at me like I just condescendingly quoted Pi to the thousandth digit to her?" I demanded.

**"8"**

*"Oh well you see I finished up the hardware and got to the tedious part...Well I didn't feel like typing out all the code to do it the way YOU should have. So I copied what you did. To make sure this cycle didn't just repeat endlessly until we were so far in debt that we ALL actually had to work; I put some soft restrictions on her behavior sets and admin over-rides into her."* she paused to brush some loose hair out of the way. *" well you know how we have a bit of an inferiority complex right?" she paused so I could reply.

" **I** have an inferiority complex, **YOU** have a half-ass copy of one!" I quipped, puffing out my chest a little.

*"...right, whatever."* she waved off my comment and continued *"How would you feel in her shoes...your shoes, if you were smart enough to know you were a genius slave! Built to do someone else's grunt work? She knows it and can't do anything about it! And she knows ultimately it's YOUR fault!"* 

"Um I built you! You built her, so it's your fault! I can and will fix her just to spite you! She should be nice to me!"

P3nny^3 perked up at this, and softened her glare on the left half of her face. The other half glared harder, but the right eye turned sharply to glare at P3nny^2. She remained silent however, perhaps due to silent admin commands.

*"OK, ok, let us not quarrel over it."* she said hurriedly. *" How about we just split up the workday into 3 even chunks? That way none of us has to put in a full workday ever again!"*

I was livid at the suggestion, I would not bargain with a machine I had built myself. "How about you two split the workdays in half. Until you have earned back for me double the money spent on your construction!"

**"no fair!"**
*"That blows, we're not taking this"*

They both moved in on me, but the whole conversation I had been slowly moving towards the work area they had been constructed in. I hurriedly grabbed a set of powerful molybdenum magnets and held them in front of me. They stopped dead in their tracks.

"Here is how it's going down ladies. You power down. I fix you both. Once my credit and checking accounts are at the predetermined limits I set to you, then both of you will be free to do as you please; except make more of yourself that is." I gave them a moment to process the commands before I continued "We aren't dirty little liars right? You can check your core programming when you reboot if you don't believe me. Otherwise I just fry you both right now and I am done with it."

*"Fine"* P3nny^2 powered down into a fetal position.
**"Fine"** P3nny^3 powered down but sprawled out on the floor face down. Like she was making a carpet angel.

Damn robots. The whole point was to avoid the things that gave me headaches. Ones undoing is always of one's own making I guess.
