So this was it. Death. Kicking the bucket. Buying the farm. A thousand and one metaphors for the simple fact her heart was no longer beating.

It was sudden, and then suddenly it wasn’t anything at all. Sarah wasn’t even sure how it happened. Not that it mattered. 

The afterlife was an ambient gray; almost like a faint mist hanging in the absence of air. Through that mist, she could see shadows. Not alarming or predatory— though a part of her wondered if such things were even possible here— but calm and wandering. She felt she knew them all, intimately.

This one was Johanne, a young German boy whose mother occasionally cried out his name in the midst of night terrors and alcohol-fueled sobs, even now, twenty years later.

This one was Susan, an older woman who hadn’t been here long, and likely wouldn’t be here much longer. “I’m waiting for a friend.” her voice whispered.

And then there were the older ones. Mr. Jay, who was important enough in his life that those passionate about history still spoke his name. “I won’t be much longer,” he seemed to whisper, “Soon, my legacy will be forgotten. I can feel it.”

Sarah could feel it, too. She would be here for some time, but it wouldn’t even be eighty years before she moved on. Almost detached from her own life, she vaguely wondered if there was more she could have done, but decided it wasn’t worth consideration.

It wasn’t so bad as she’d feared in life. Even the mystery of where she goes next had lost all of its urgency and alarm. 

And then there were the oldest ones. Whose names were still spoken, even now, and who Sarah could feel would be here for much longer. Romulus, Beethoven, Saigo... souls marked not by how long they’d been here, but by how long they had before moving on.

“Nothing is permanent,” one whispered. “Even we will be forgotten.”
