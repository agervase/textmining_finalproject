"There's a sun over there," I said pointing at the top left corner.  

"You see a sun?" the tour guide asked with incredulity. We'd been in the Louvre for the past 3 hours with the Mona Lisa being the final stop of our tour.  

"I'm serious," I said moving a bit closer. He was not the first and would not be the last to judge what I could see using his own eyes.  His back stiffened as if taking measures to defend the picture from whatever lunacy I brought with me. I could see a bright yellow moon and stars similar to what Van Gogh drew in his Starry Night. I took out my phone and confirmed. They were arranged in the same way too.    

The background most saw as plain, dull green I saw as illuminated with dots of birds all flying Westward.   

"This is the most valuable painting in the world, hundreds of experts have examined it more than a thousand times over with X-rays, MRIs and every other device known to man. You're saying you just spotted something so obvious with your naked eye?"  The guide asked.   

I ignored his statements as I took a step back. The birds seemed to form letters. "Surgit," I whispered.  A ripple flowed from the painting's centre going out, it reflected on the picture's edges then rolled back in. The moon started to shine brighter, the stars faded. As far as I could tell it was now daytime in the painting. The birds flew into the horizon of the picture until they could no longer be seen. The curator took a few steps back as did the other visitors in awe. This they could see.   

Mona Lisa slowly tilted her head beckoning me to come closer. The curator stood up ready to push me back but he was a few seconds too late. Her hand was out. It grasped mine and with a small firm pull I went into the portrait.
