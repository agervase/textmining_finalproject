Death stood next to the blind boy and watched with him. 

"do you know why child I take who I take?" Death asked the blind boy. 

The boy shoot his head, the shadowy figure of his mother passing in and out of view as she giggled over a glass of wine. His father and the man boy did not see talked in whispers. 

"I take the ones I take, because they are the only ones I can see. You see my child, death is blind, just like you. I take only those the universe decrees." 

"am I to be alone then?"

"can you see yourself." Death asked

the boy looked down but saw the pitch black of his normalcy. 

"...no." The boy whispered. 

"then you are to be alone." Death replied. 

The boy turned and saw her. Death. While the others were but gesture given form by smoke, death stood pale, terrifying and beautiful. Bright white skin, her eyes blacker than black somehow, a coy smile on pale blue lips. She wore a robe of raven feathers, and her hair seemed to be the stars. The boy knew not these things, but somehow he did. 

"Is there anything to be done? Might I trade something for them." 

Death looked at the boy ruefully, her eyes turned downward. 

"no child, I am afraid not. Nothing can be done by me. But do not worry, for I have seen your future should you choose it. You will survive, thrive, grow old, have many children, and be rich. Then I shall take you gently into my embrace." 

The boy nodded. Death stood alone for a while watching the boy leave her sight. The figures of the mother, the father, and the little girl all swam before her, their smoky forms dancing in their mortality. 

And then their was dark. The figures disappeared. 

A scream pieced the dark, and the outline of a crooked decrepit man lying before death appeared, as a cacophany of screams arose. The boy appeared once again next to the figure and drove the kitchen knife down again and again. 

Death watched as the fate seen before vanished, and a new one took it's place.
