"**THEY ARE ADVANCING ON US IN GREATER NUMBERS.  YOU MUST BE IMPORTANT,**" Death's voiced, echoing like a dying gasp in a tomb.  "**GOOD.  WE NEED SOMETHING TO EVEN THIS OUT.**"

"What *are* those things?!  They *ate* that other girl!  Is this Hell or something?"  I whirled suddenly, looking for more attackers.  "I lived a good life!  I don't deserve to be in Hell.  I should be in Heaven!"

"**THIS PLACE IS NIETHER, AND THOSE NAMES ARE NOW MEANINGLESS,**" Death rasped.  "**THE HEAVENS AND HELLS HAVE ALL ALIGNED TOGETHER TO FACE THIS GREATER THREAT.  I AM TAKING YOU TO VALHALLA, THE BASTION OF REALITY.**"

"Val...Valhalla?  But I'm Episcopalian."

"**IT MATTERS NOT,**" stated Death.  He paused, like the last breath of an old man.  "**GOOD OR EVIL, HANGED GOD OR OLD GOD, HINDU OR SHINTO, FROM GEHENNA, ELYSIUM, TARTARUS, HELL, HEAVEN, IT MATTERS NOT.  ALL GO NOW TO VALHALLA.**"

"But, why Valhalla," I questioned.  "Isn't that like, for Vikings?  All drinking, and wenching, and fighting and stuff?"

"**BECAUSE,**" Death replied, "**IT IS THE GREATEST FORTRESS IN CREATION, WITH THE GREATEST WARRIORS IN ALL HISTORY.  WHERE ELSE BETTER TO BUILD THE GREATEST ARMY IN ALL REALITY?  ALL ARE NOW CONSCRIPTED, BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS ANNIHILATION.  WE, ALL OF REALITY, IS AT WAR.**"  Death began to pick up the pace, seeming to have an anxious look on his face, as much as a dead skull with vacant eye sockets and a rictus grin can look anxious.

"All of reality is at war?  With what?" I asked, nervously swinging the sword Death handed me as he ushered me from my body to, well, whatever this field is.  I almost bumped into him, as he had stopped and was crouching.

"**FROM THOSE THAT EXISTED BEFORE REALITY.  THEY ARE BACK.  QUIET NOW; THEY ARE NEAR.**"  Death gripped the haft of his scythe tighter, ready to swing in any direction if need be.  I gripped my short sword shakily in both hands, feeling wholly inadequate.  Every rock, every bush, every single point on this weird landscape seemed ready to birth out danger and new horrors.  If I wasn't already dead, I'd have had a heart attack on the spot.

Suddenly, the bushes to our right exploded with activity, and more of those formless shadows sped towards us.  As I responded with a mix of horror and atavistic, primal rage, the thing took shape: a nightmarish conglomeration of tentacles, hooks, claws and mouths, all gibbering and slavering incoherently.  I swung for the abomination's head, and cleaved it from its body with a wild gesticulation and strangled scream.  The noise it made in it's death throes would be enough to drive the sanity from a rock, a low basso rumble that rapidly escalated to piercing shrieks that shot directly into the soul.

I ran to help Death, who, while clearly an able fighter, was constantly missing the mark.  His swings were expertly performed (as far as I could tell), but it almost seemed as if Death couldn't find what he was aiming for.  Screaming in fear and desperation, I swing again at the thing's head, again severing it.  Panting, I fell to my knees, my legs quaking too much to hold me up.

"Why didn't you just cut it's head off?" I gasped between heaves.

"**HEAD?  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?**"  was Death's somber response, like the faint tolling of an iron bell.  "**THESE THINGS HAVE NO FORM; IT IS WHY THEY ARE SO HARD TO DEFEAT.**"

"What?  I can see them.  They're hideous!  But I cut both their heads off.  You mean to say," I started slowly, "that you can't see what I'm seeing here?"

"**NO,**" came Death's reply, "**BUT THINGS ARE NOW BECOMING CLEARER.  WE MUST MAKE HASTE TO THE FORTIFICATIONS AT BIFROST,**" his chill tone continued.  "**I WILL USHER YOU TO THE GENERAL HOST OF YAHWEH, ODIN, AMATERASU, AND GILGAMESH.  YOU MAY CHANGE THE TIDE FOR US ALL.  AND I'M SURE THE COMMANDER OF THE HOST WILL WANT TO TALK WITH YOU.**"

I cowered a bit at the implications of that statement.  "Who could possibly command the gods themselves?"

Death turned to me, his sockets piercing my essence and bringing an artic chill over my entire existence.  "**TED.  FROM ACCOUNTING.**"
