Men are dumb. Let me count the ways.

First of all, they assume that having a tournament where they bash each other's heads in is a good way to charm a woman like me. Like I'm some kind of prize to be claimed by the "winner", and would just kind of go along with it. Don't they realise I'm an actual princess, with the legal power to actually cut their heads off? No, they don't realise it. Men are dumb.

Secondly, they think that I'd be amazed that a so-called knight might pull out a Glock at a jousting tournament. Moron. Time travel exists. Everyone from the future who ends up in a medieval tournament tries something like this, and thinks they're the first one who did. But once time travel is invented, it's not long before it's cheap enough to be sold into the mass market, and then whichever time period is popular in the imagination gets flooded with visitors. Particularly to my year. Particularly to my tournaments. Particularly by men with Glocks. And they think they're the first. Men are dumb.

And finally, and most importantly, they think that the spectators at a medieval tournament have only experienced mediaeval times. Not me. I've come home after getting a degree from Bryn Mawr in the year 2173. I have my own Glock. The only thing I don't have is a working time machine to ride back out and explore the rest of time again. All I needed was someone from the future dumb enough to show up with a time machine. That's why we put the competition on in the first place.

I can't wait for this tournament to be over, and the guards to have taken care of our visitor. I want to visit the robotics factories of Gaborone, Botswana, in the year 2517. I want to visit the Great Barrier Reef in Australia at its ecological peak in 1995. I want to gather all the knowledge I can to protect the realm from time travelling tourists, and ensure that we're not dumb. 

Certainly not as dumb as this walking dead man with the Glock.
