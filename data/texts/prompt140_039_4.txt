 

**INT. DEATH’S OFFICE** 

A gorgeous man with comically sized angel wings extend from his back and fold over the back of a rickety old wooden chair that is just slightly too small for the large mahogany desk that he is sitting at. He fumbles through several documents with photos attached. He has a large stamp with the words “GOT EEM” in bold font are damp with fresh, crimson ink. The man whistles “Ring around the Rosie” as he does his work. He mouths “we all fall down” and then makes fake cheering noises quietly. He stops what he’s doing and pulls out a document from a new folder and sees in the photo an old man who looks like he’s suffocating with DEATH holding out the peace sign next to him. He clearly took the photo with a selfie stick.

DEATH:

Haha sorry pal I looked too fresh to pass that one up. 

The man stands up and walks to one of the walls of his office. He presses his hand against the blank wall and small creases open up and a shelf with hundreds of hour glasses pops out like a file cabinet. As he resumes his whistling he finds the one he’s looking for and turns it over. He pushes the shelf back into the wall and returns to his desk. He picks up the stamp and slaps the paper with it. 

DEATH:

GOT EEM! 

He then puts the page back in a folder and opens the cabinet on his desk. CLUNK! He looks confused. His foot definitely hit something, but what? He kneels under his desk and sees a rogue hourglass half turned.

DEATH:

Ah shit.

**EXT. MANSION IN CALIFORNIA - NIGHT**

DEATH steps out of a Honda Civic, his wings are missing.

DEATH:

Thanks man, I’ll give you 5 stars since you got snacks. I’m serious, you’re doing great things. 

The driver nods, waves goodbye and takes off. DEATH waits until the driver is out of view then walks through the steel gate at the end of the mansion’s driveway. 

DEATH:

Huh you’ve really made it big time haven’t you buddy. 

**INT. MANSION IN CALIFORNIA - NIGHT**

DEATH walks through the front door and starts snooping around the entryway. Gorgeous paintings hang from the walls and interesting sculptures sit atop small pillars on either side of the entryway. DEATH pokes at one of them as he passes by. A television is on and we hear what sounds like a football game announcer commenting on plays. DEATH follows the sound and finds himself in a large living room with expensive furniture and a massive TV hanging from the far wall. A silhouette sits on the couch watching intently. 

DEATH:

There you are. Time’s up pal.

The silhouette doesn’t react as though the words went right through him. DEATH creeps up behind him and presses his hand on the silhouettes shoulder and whispers.

DEATH:

Yeet. 

A moment goes by and the silhouette doesn’t move. DEATH looks confused and pulls back on it’s shoulder only to reveal it was a dummy.

DEATH:

What the hell?

From behind a large chair falls down upon DEATH but goes right through him. DEATH jumps and turns around to see standing before him is his mark. KEANU REEVES. 

DEATH:

Alright calm down buddy. You’ve had far longer than anyone else, it’s time to go. 

KEEANU:

I’ve been chosen, you won’t take me.

DEATH:

Chosen? What the hell are you talking about?

KEEANU:

God chose me. You’re not taking me, not today!

KEEANU jumps backwards and grabs one of the statues from the entryway and hurls it at DEATH. It floats right through him and shatters on the floor. 

DEATH:

Woah guy, you weren’t chosen for nothing, the big guy stopped doing that a long time ago. 

KEEANU:

I don’t believe you, you want me? You’re gonna have to kill me!

KEEANU rushes at DEATH full speed with fists ready to strike. DEATH stand still as he appraoches rapidly. The moment he gets in striking distance DEATH reaches his finger out and pokes KEEANU in the chest. A spark of blood fires out of KEEANU’s back and he dies instantly, slumping to the floor. Death pulls out his cell phone and attaches a selfie stick to it. He then proceeds to take a selfie with KEEANU’s dead body, decides the photo doesn’t capture his good side, and snaps a couple more. 

DEATH:

Cool, see ya later man.
