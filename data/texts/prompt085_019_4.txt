Dave was a particularly boring man, he worked a boring office job, he generally ate boring food, slept in his boring bed in his boring house next to his boring wife in a boring neighbourhood, he loved everything about his boring life. The only thing interesting about Dave was a quirk of his brain. Whenever he did something interesting, no matter how small or big, he would hear a voice say “you have saved (insert value) people”. This would happen if he decided to take a shortcut to work, wear a different hat or eat at a different place. One Sunday morning, Dave decided to go to the local sandwich shop, which he always did on Sunday, and order a sandwich. He was feeling particularly adventurous that day and decided to try a different type of bread. He retrieved his sandwich and walked out, having stopped taking the voice seriously years ago. Little did he know, that the bread he chose not to have that day had been contaminated by a mutant strain of bacteria, that would have caused a zombie plague that, had the bread been contaminated any other Sunday, Dave would have become patient zero. However, the woman in line after him, was down on her luck. She had given up on everything, and decided to get a sandwich before jumping off a bridge. The woman ordered a flatbread sandwich, with every topping imaginable. She ate the sandwich, and leapt to her death never knowing that she had drowned every single cell of a disease which would have killed half the planet. Dave of course, didn’t know what had happened until he heard a voice scream in his ear “YOU HAVE SAVED 5 BILLION PEOPLE!!!!!” shortly before bed. Dave noted it in a beige notebook by his bead, as he usually did to allow himself to forget it. Dave forgot it instantly, and went to sleep.
