Her eyes dulled as she exhaled her last breath. The world slowly blurred into a faint grey.

&#x200B;

She smiled. Gone were the days where she suffered in silence as lifeless machines fought to keep her soul tethered to her body. She stretched out her hand to embrace the welcoming darkness that wished to envelope her.

&#x200B;

A faintly human silhouette began to manifest in front of her. Tendrils of dark mist coalesced into a being of living shadow holding an ethereal scythe. At last, death has come for her.

&#x200B;

"A little late aren't you?" she asked, glancing at the shimmering edge of Death's scythe.

&#x200B;

"I will only come for you when your time is up, Miss Brennett. Now, come with me." Death beckoned towards a faint light in the middle of the shadows.

&#x200B;

She crossed her arms. "And if I don't want to?"

&#x200B;

"Then my scythe will help convince you," Death said. The scythe began to solidify into a blade of pure red, gleaming with the promise of carnage.

&#x200B;

Her eyes widened slightly. "Okay, I get your point. I don't want to get deader than I already am anyway. So where are we going to? Heaven? Hell? The jungle?"

&#x200B;

"See for yourself," Death turned away from her and began walking.

&#x200B;

"Wow, acting the cool, mysterious dude eh? Well this won't be fun," she pouted.

&#x200B;

"When was dying supposed to be fun? Aren't you a bit too nonchalant about this?" Death replied, amusement coloring his voice.

&#x200B;

"Beats lying in bed with nothing to do," she said, eyes transfixed on the growing light in the distance.

&#x200B;

"No regrets about your life? Family, friends and whatnot," Death turned his hooded face in her direction. "Miss Brennett, I must say you are being quite casual about this."

&#x200B;

"I don't give a damn about them anyway, just like they don't give a damn about me. They say they care, but eventually they all forget. I'm used to it. I know I'm burdening them anyway," she shrugged. "You," she turned to face Death, "should had came for me earlier. Save my old folks some money. Hospital care isn't free you know."

&#x200B;

Death raised an eyebrow. "And what makes you think that dying will solve all this?"

&#x200B;

"Death seems interesting. At least, when compared to my previous life," she said.

&#x200B;

"Already referring to your life in the past tense I see," Death shook his head. "Well, if I must say, the afterlife is quite similar to your past experience in the hospital. The only difference is that your mental capacity will be reduced to that of a plant."

&#x200B;

She stopped and stared at Death blankly. "You mean everything is the same? I don't get to live another life?"

&#x200B;

Her hands curled into trembling fists. "How is that fair? Why can't I be like normal people and live my life? Are you saying that this life is supposed to be enough for me to enjoy? I don't want it to end this way," she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.

&#x200B;

Death drew his scythe. The crimson edge of the blade glowed menacingly, thirsting for violence. "Resist and you will encounter a fate worse than what is in store for you."

&#x200B;

"There's nothing worse than what is already awaiting me," she shrieked. "I wish I didn't exist," she collapsed on the floor sobbing. "Even death fails me."

&#x200B;

Death looked at her trembling figure and steeled his gaze. "I knew it would come to this." He raised his scythe high above his head. The scythe shuddered in response, ready to take action.

&#x200B;

Red mist spilled from the blade and slowly fused into a flowing cloak. Death grabbed the cloak and covered her with it.

&#x200B;

"I cannot guarantee you that you will enjoy your new duties, but I am not asking for your permission, nor am I waiting for your decision. This responsibility is one you cannot avoid or reject," Death said, the words weaving into a crescendo of power and energy. "From this moment onwards, you will be tasked with the retrievement of those who have passed. You will bring peace to the dead and accompany them in their final moments. In the name of the One Above Us All, I hereby declare Sarah Josephine Brennett to be an agent of death."

&#x200B;

Death reached into the air and gestured towards the skies. A convulsing black void appeared directly above his palm, slowly taking the shape of a scythe.

&#x200B;

Sarah raised her head a looked at Death. "Thank you," she said while trying to prevent her voice from cracking.

&#x200B;

"Don't thank me. This may be a different fate from what awaited you before, but in time you will grow to hate it, just like I did." Death looked towards the soft white light and began walking. "Come, Sarah. You have a lot to learn."

&#x200B;

Sarah smiled through her tears and got up. *In time I might hate this*, she thought, *but for now this is enough.*
