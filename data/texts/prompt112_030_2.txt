“Here lies Edman Collette.” The tombstone read. “Passed away on the 31st of August, 1354.” It had been a long time since he died. Too long, he thought, turning away from the grave and silently wandering back to the gates. They were closed, since it was night time, but that didn’t bother him. He simply moved through them without trouble, he passed another on his way out, a woman: Oriana. He’d seen her a few times, but hadn’t really spoken to her much, if you call it that. He couldn’t speak in his current form, rather, he was able to communicate some other way with the others. It was hard to describe, he couldn’t hear their words, but the meaning reached him. He’d been this way for so long that he couldn’t even remember what it was like to speak. He felt something behind him, it was a familiar feeling, the feeling of energy being released into the void. He turned to see the woman on her knees, appearing to steam away, like she was made of dry ice. After a moment, she was gone. He’d seen this all too many times before. The death after death. The last living person to know her had shifted from this mortal coil and joined him in this realm, but it’s the memories of the living that tie them here. The woman he saw before had effectively been removed from existence, at least as far as he could tell. The strange thing was, he was still here, even after all this time. He’d seen the rise and fall of civilizations, he’d seen the world almost end twice, and he’d watched the lives of the living to their completion countless times. He’d been stuck in this abyss for over 15,000 years. After all this time, he only had one desire left. He wanted to know who.
