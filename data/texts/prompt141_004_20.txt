No, no, no! Don't do that!

I can only watch as my body carries me out a window. Through gritted teeth, I cry out.

Alucardo!

I fall a few feet down the side of my tower and into a portal. On the other side is a mouthful of salt water brined in the leavings of countless organisms.

Before my flailing body sinks into the deep, I cry out.

Elumaria!

And plop!

I'm back in my study.

My body scrambles up and I fight to keep myself off balance, keep myself on the warm wood paneling and away from all and any windows and sharp objects.

It's no use.

My body rights itself and, to my surprise. Carries me over to a spellbook.

Now I'm being forced to look at my spells. These aren't polished spells either, these are spells still under construction, still needing t's crossed and i's dotted.

Mificario! I yell out.

Oh no, no, no, no! Not this one.

Now I'm falling, falling into the endless cavern that is the voracious maw of the dark one, a wyrm from the depths of the sightless sounds, a raging beast set to consume our world.

I've heard warnings of it, in the lilting shadows and the musty odors of many a Wizards tavern, but I dared not look further, dared not to bungle my way into a new spell, for fear it would lead me into it's grasp.

Now here it is before me. Eyes glimmering yellow with flashes of green, it's Gecko face and bulldog smile looks up at me as I fall, flapping and wailing.

Ignicario.

The creature bursts into black flame and roars as I disappear in a spark of Ash.

I pull myself out of my fireplace and roll around wildly, uncertain if this is by my own will or my unruly skeleton doing so. He doesn't do such a great job so I yell out a spell once again.

Maranius!

A cloud of water appears above me, then falls on top of me.

Soaked and slimy, I pull myself up and try to remain completely still.

Nothing.

No movements.

Then my arm shoots out and grabs the Skull of Icarus.

Shit.
