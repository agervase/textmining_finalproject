  They beat us, they beat us bad. I should have assumed that technology would advance, but to be able to get here 50 years earlier than us, that's insane. Their rocket was completely perfect.
  Spacelined, solar powered, and completely made out of some form of carbon. I rubbed my hand along the edge, and felt nothing against the frictionless material. I was admiring the craft when the mayor came up behind me. 
  "She a beauty isn't she."
  "Extremely, every inch is perfect. I never thought I would live to see a ship better than the one I captained, but I guess times change. How did you ever figure out faster than light travel."
  "This," he said pulling out what seemed to be completely black cylinder."a dark energy generator. Extremely fragile and explosive but can launch a rocket faster than you can say earth. "
  I held the cylinder in my hand I could see past the ionized silicon into what appeared to be complete blackness, so black the light around it was extremely dimmed. 
  After supper that night while I was heading to bed I saw something. The storage building was glowing black, contaminating the light around it. I called all the crew to have them look at it. The captain said it was probably just a leak but they would still check it out. Then my idea unfolded. 
  I don't know why but I had to. I ran back far enough away, and pulled out the cylinder out of my bag. I threw it, a perfect throw. Thanks to the lower gravity the homemade grenade exploded causing a chain reaction through out the building instantly killing all the crew. 
  I had failed, I would never be the first person on a planet. No- I would never be the first, but I could be the last.
