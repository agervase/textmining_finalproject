A chirp woke Candice. She stretched, wishing the bed was as comfortable as the one she remembered from home. “Siri,” Candice said as she stood up. “Set an alarm for an hour before sunset.”

Siri replied, “I’ve set an alarm for 5:47 pm.”

She took a set of keys from the nightstand – a cheap but rare find from Ikea – and unlocked the cell door. Candice hung them around her key from a lanyard and peeked through the bars. Rain dripped in from cracks in the skylight overhead.

The next few movements were quick, just as she’d practiced them nearly a thousands times now. Into the hall. Lock the cell. Across the hall. Unlock and in. Relock. It was then she started breathing again. She tied her hair back and flicked on the radio.

*… do not go outside after sundown, avoid contact with anyone not already in your home, and do not make any light or noise between sundown and sunrise. At this time, military aid is unavailable. Be safe, and good luck. Message #12. Repeating in 60 seconds …*

A series of tones emitted from the speaker in five second intervals. “Shit,” Candice said to radio and switches it off. “I really overslept this morning.” A mouse – the tan one with a brown spot over it’s right eye that she called Henry – nibbled on an aged morsel. She said to him, “We missed 11 messages this morning, Henry. I think that’s our worst.”

She smiled. “So, what’s for breakfast, then?” She nodded, thoughtfully, imagining his answers in her mind. *Unleavened toast, fried eggs, and* … she glanced around inside the refrigerator … *I guess that’s it, my dear.*

“Damn, we’ll need to go out to the yard today then.” A shudder crawled down her spine, almost running from the words she spoke. After moving the chickens and potted plants into the main hall of the cell block, she’d hoped she wouldn’t need to make anymore trips out to the yard. 

Candice turned on the electric griddle and cracked two eggs into the pan. They hissed at her but she’d turned her attention to her phone. She settled into a metal folding chair and read what she’d missed while other time zones had daylight past hers the night before.

“What’s up with Riot?” Candice asked and shook her head. She flipped the eggs and wrinkled her nose at the slightly burnt edges. A minute She settled back into the metal folding chair and switched to SMS.

XXX: hey, you ok?

Riot: heard something bad on the amateur radio

Riot: they’re saying power out here is failing

Riot: im freakin out

XXX: you got that setup I told you about.

Candice glanced up at the old bicycle she’d mounted and rigged to recharge a small bank of car batteries she’d pulled from the parking lot in front of the prison. She slid the eggs onto her plate and turned off the griddle.

Riot: no

XXX: wtf

Riot: I know. But a fuckin bike aint easy to find
