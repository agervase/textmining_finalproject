“Oh god, another one.” I thought quietly to myself. Like vultures they circled around me before talking to me. Not the spirits that is, all the mourners and wellwishers. Every acquaintance that felt like they had the right to tell me that things will get better. I bit my lip as Mrs. Carwfisher almost cheerfully solemn, touched my arms and told me, “Oh dear, I’m so sorry.  No one should lose their husband so young.”

&nbsp;

I’ve seen all manner of spirits since I grew up, my only defense was complete indifference. I would have been driven mad years ago if I ever responded to the pleading and moaning of every ghost that has ever bothered me.  “Thank you so much, Mrs. Carwfisher. It means so---" I had to stop as I felt my voice crack.

&nbsp;

My stupid dead husband was trying to make me laugh. “Oh dear I know, I know.” Mrs. Carwfisher reached over and embraced me as I continued to fight with every ounce of my will to keep a straight face. Meanwhile my husband’s efforts seem redoubled. He was no longer content making the most obnoxious faces he has somehow decided that now is the best time to give me an afterlife magic mike dance.

&nbsp;

“Oh honey.” Mrs. Carwfisher mewed softly in my ear, “it’ll be okay, I promise.” Looking at all the spirits around Mrs. Carwfisher that seemed completely uninterested in her performance I got the feeling that she had never experienced loss before.

&nbsp;

“thank you, I promise I’m totally okay. It’s just hard sometimes to let go. I’m sure over time it’ll-“ I burst into quiet chuckles as my dead husband began twerking head level to Mrs. Carwfisher standing on produce stand. While Mrs. Carwfisher immediately started the whole comfort cycle all over again, I watched as my husband, sat down on the shelves and winked at me.

&nbsp;

The smile on my face gave me away as he grinned stupidly at me. “Hey babe.” His spirit whispered. And that’s when my troubles began.
