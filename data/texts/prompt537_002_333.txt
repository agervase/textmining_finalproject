"You don't find it strange how no one knows how the humans got here? They show up on what were once uninhabitable worlds, and then offer themselves out as cheap labor?" Corl said while we landed our transport.

"No, not really. If anything I wonder why no one will hire them. From what I can see they are amazingly fast workers. I mean just look, the main buildings already done!" I countered. 

"Ok, fine they build fast, but that doesn't look like your plans to me. The buildings are so short and the windows are just slits, and look at those doors. Why do you need a set of heavy steel doors?"

"Well, maybe that's just the architecture of their home. I like a little diversity. And look at the scans of the planet. They built most of the resort under ground! That will save on heating, and it will allow for more open air activities. " 

We continued the rest of the way in silence. When we got to the gate into the resort, a gaurd scared us in and opens a set of gates. It's funny I don't remember asking for armed security. 

"Mr. Basj, we have finished the primary structure, and have begun clearing secondary positions and will begin importing the heavy machinery soon" the young Forman replied 

"Heavy machinery? For what exactly?" I asked confused.

"Sir you can't have a proper holdout without proper defences"

Holdout? What was he talking about. I quietly excused myself and went to my office. Once there I pulled out the contract and immediately relised what I had done. 

1 request for 500 humans to help build and maintain my last resort. 

They hadn't taken last resort to mean the last vacation  getaway in my new chain of vacation spots. I'd hired human mercenaries  to build me a fortified planet. Oh the stock holders won't be happy with me now.
