It came out of nowhere. I was walking down the side of the road and then I was on the ground with what felt like a heavy weight on my chest. Surprisingly there was no pain. It just felt hard to breathe or move my head. Looking back on it I think I was hit by a car. I suppose it doesn't matter much anymore. I sat there, more confused than anything while I tried to get my body to listen to me. "I have to get up. I'm getting all dirty and I have to get to class" kept running through my head. Eventually I blinked and then there was nothing. 

I awoke in a white room. At least I think it was a room. It was really more of a void. There was just a soft white light as far as I could see. Even the floor shone. The only object I could make out was a machine. You know those old fortune telling machines? The ones with the mechanical man and the crystal ball inside? It looked kind of like that except the glass had been replaced by wood. The only marking I could find on it was a small plaque above a coin slot that said "Pay $1 to live another day". 

I didn't know exactly what this machine was but I was clever enough to put two and two together and realize that I was dead and this was my only way out. Thanking God for the second chance I reached into my pocket for change. Luckily I always carried change. Then it hit me.

It's not fucking 1923 and no one carries silver dollars anymore. I kicked the antiquated hunk of crap over and then spent the rest of time in Hell having my skin peeled off over and over again by imps.
