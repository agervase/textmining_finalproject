I never thought meeting Satan would be so sad. He sat on his thrones of charred bones all alone, with his tail lashing behind him and his horns protruding into the black and red sky. The shrill noise of the harmonica he was playing beat against my ears over the rumble of distant thunder and the crackling of Hellfire.

I knew I was supposed to go to Hell, people like me were destined to. What I was surprised by was how empty Hell would be. What the fuck happened to going to Hell for the company? Lying Mark Twain, that son of a bitch. 

Satan stopped his dreaded harmonica playing when he saw me, standing stupidly in my all black clothes. His eyes brightened and his tail wagged like a puppy's? He gestured me forward. Reluctantly, I walked down the bone-laid road to Satan's throne. 

"Hello, human," said Satan, his voice two different pitches of utter nightmare. I physically winced when I heard it, and Satan frowned. "I can fix the voice if you don't like it." He said that in a warm baritone.

"That's great, thank you." Up close, he was about 8-feet tall, with his throne twice as large as him. He smelled of sulfur and brimstone, no surprise there. And he only wore a thick loincloth held up by a belt of frozen intestines. It did an adequate of hiding his private parts.

"So..." the Devil started, looking around. He scratched his ear. "What are you in for?" 

"Shouldn't you know?" I asked. "Don't you read the records of who gets admitted?" 

He sighed, a yellowy cloud escaping his mouth. "I had a demon for that, but he left for Heaven, too. Just like the rest of them." He bit his lower lip as his eyes watered a little bit. 

"Left for Heaven?" What the fuck was he talking about? And why the fuck was he so upset?

The Dark Lord pounded his fist against his throne, got up and walked behind it, his shoulders slumping. "There's some loophole that allows people to leave Hell for Heaven. Stupid God and his goddamn tricks!" 

I cleared my throat, following him around the throne. "That's why this place is so empty." 

"You don't have to rub it in my face," he muttered, bringing out his harmonica and playing it. This just keeps getting sadder and sadder.

"Hey, listen..."

"What? Do you want to leave, too? Fine! I will show you where the damn loophole is!" 

Watching Satan frown was quite a visceral experience. Who would have thought that the embodiment of sin could get lonely. I don't know what it was but I wanted to help him. I spent my life helping people everyone called devils. Why not help the actual Devil?" 

"Hey, Satan. Why don't you show me the loophole, and I will see if I can fix it for you." 

He leaned forward, his tailed moving again. "Why? Are you a lawyer? How good are you?"

"I kept the Lehman brothers out of jail." 

Satan's eyes widened, and his lips curled into a smile. "Would you really do that for me? Look through God's contract?" 

I sighed. "Sure, why not?"

Satan leaped to his feet, shaking the ground. "Do you think we can get everybody back?" 

I looked around at the desolation around me, and then at Satan's pleading eyes. "Yes. But why don't we revamp the place, too. Make it a little more enjoyable." 

"But that would go against the contract." 

"Not if I can help it."

He clapped his hands. "I like you already. Come on. Let's stick it to my father!" 

"Yeah..." 

I was still unsure what I was getting into, but watching Satan perk up like that was enough for me to continue.

"Can we get something to eat first?" I asked. "I am starving." 

"Oh, yeah, that comes with the territory." He put his hand on my back. "But I can take care of that. No other place cooks meat better than Hell's kitchen. And I can make a killer steak." 

"Sounds good." 

"And if we have time, I can play my harmonica for you." 

"Let's save that for when we fix the loophole."

"Yeah! And when we do, you can be advisor." 

"I would rather stick to being your lawyer." 

"How about being my 'friend'?"

"Sure, buddy."
