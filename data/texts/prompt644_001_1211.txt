For a man with no direction, my gaze doesn’t tend to sway very often. When I am on a delivery, I move through countless environments. The subway, the street, the malls, the apartments, all those people, and yet almost all of the time I look straight, my mind somewhere else.

*“I’m sorry,” she says, hugging me hard, the way she does when I come home too late at night, or with cuts from the bullies at school.*

*“Where are you going, mommy?”*

*“Somewhere very far,” she says. I feel a tear, hot and warm, drip down onto my neck as she retreats.*

*“When will you come back?”*

*“I don’t know.”*

*“Will you come back?”*

*Her lips tremble, and I feel fear, fear at realizing that for the first time, she cannot put a smile on for my sake.*

*“I will,” she says, finally, her voice shaking, her brown-flecked eyes trembling. “I promise.”*

*“Okay.”*

*“Do you believe Mommy?” This time, I get the feeling she isn’t asking for a specific answer, but rather that she genuinely does not know.*

*“Of course, mommy! I’ll miss you.”*

*“I’ll miss you too. So much, you don't even know…”*

*That was the last I saw of her.*

I wonder what she would think of me now, lethargic and lost, no longer even searching for an aim, falling deeper and deeper into a life she would be ashamed of. Ever since that night, I have felt like I have been waiting for her to come back…to tell me what to do.

Sometimes, during the day, I stop, just to catch my breath. I dip my head, close my eyes, and imagine that when I raise it, she will be there…

*The first time happened in a park, as I moved to sit down and take a break before my final batch.*

*The park is almost empty. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and look up. Will she be older? Does she still wear glasses? Will she recognize me?*

*The force comes suddenly, and all the wind is knocked out of me as I lay sprawled on the ground.*

*Hands move swiftly over my body, firm but not too intrusive. Fingers on my neck, to check a pulse.*

*“Blocked, sir. Contact not made,” a voice says. I open my eyes to see a man leaving, without even a glance back to see if I am okay.*

*I look up, around the park. It is completely empty.*

So began the attacks. I reported it to the police once, who then asked to inspect my backpack to make sure I wasn’t involved in “illegitimate activities for a young man.” I had gotten up and left after that.

Even trying to isolate myself in public, it doesn’t work. At McDonald’s, on the train, at the grocery store, on the block my dingy apartment is. They come dressed in black, and that is all I ever see of them.

But today, I saw him, as I raised my head at the crosswalk. He was coming at a diagonal, from my left, and I waited, hearing his footsteps get louder and louder, and…I jump back, and look up. I see his body lunge, and crumple to the ground, his eyes wide with shock at having missed. I am about to take off running, when I see, across the street...

She takes off her glasses. At first, I don’t believe it’s her. A second passes, an eternity. My heart, my head, they don't know how to react.

And then looks at me for a moment, her eyes speaking even across the street, and smiles, a smile to fill in all the memories of her that have faded throughout the years…
