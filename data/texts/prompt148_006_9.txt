I hate catching monsters. The work is grueling and dangerous, plus the job gets no respect, but it pays damn well and I'm good at it. So when my daughter stood there, begging me for another Unicorn, I thought, "No. Not again." 

My wife began to giggle. "Now Britney, you already have two sweetheart. Are you sure you really need a third?" 

"But it's Christmas, and you guys said I could choose any present I wanted!", Britney exclaimed as her face began to turn bright red. I was about to make up some bullshit excuse and tell her we couldn't afford another unicorn but then it dawned on me, the day, it's Cyber Monday. 

My eyes lit up. I had seen an ad for those fuckers for 50% off the other day and boy do I have a great credit score. I mean, I'm the world's best monster catcher, but nothing compares to my credit score. It doesn't matter who you ask, FICO, Experian, Equifax, they will all tell you the same thing; my credit score is flawless.

Without a word, I reached my hand around to my back pocket and swiftly pulled out my wallet, holding it up for everyone to see. You could see the reflection of the overhead lights glistening off the cool black leather in Britney's wide eyes. I motioned her towards me; she knew the drill. She walked over, opened my wallet, and revealed a blue American Express card. 

"Not that one princess. The Amazon one. You see, if I use the Amazon one, your dad gets 5% cash back on his purchase."

She nodded, grabbed the Amazon card and took out her IPhone XS Max and proceeded to open the Amazon app.

She looked up from her phone a moment later and asked, "Can I get same day shipping please?" 

"Of course you can honey. Of course you can."
