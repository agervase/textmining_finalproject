The bottles formed the footwork of every entry to my abode. Rolled ankles were a frequent occurrence over the loose wine bottles sprawled on the floor. I was going for something beautiful once. My ambition for ten thousand girlfriends turned into a dream of just one. Ten thousand days with her. That's all we wanted. We almost had that. We almost had *it*. 

My sorrows have not drowned. They are demons with an endless thirst. The sting of a white wine with too much acidity lost its bite. The burn of a whiskey was hardly embers. Absinthe tickles like mouthwash used to.

My urine has a permanent shade of orange to it. It reminds me of a corkscrew, without the pulp. My skin is no longer supple or tight, rather, loose, decrepit, and ever clammy. Honestly, the drinking came about as my cowardly attempt of ending my life. It turns out that my body has a mind of its own. It became a game between my body and I, to see who would eventually win. Would I manage to down enough gin before my body could stop me, or would my body regurgitate the alcohol forcibly before it had a chance to do it's damage?

It seemed my body had won. 10,000 liters of alcohol, somehow. I wonder if the times where I drank my regurgitation counted for double the amount. That would be a bit of a cheat of the system. But regardless, ten whole thousand liters. Now I'm wondering what sort of reward I received was. 

Now that I mention that, where am I? Who are you, the one reading this? Is this the power it gave? It seems fitting. I had wanted eternal life, granted to me through love that would stand against time itself. In the end, I got sweet release, an escape from reality, a dissociative moment. 

But this moment seems to have lasted longer than I would've expected. It seems that I finally won.
