"He knows!" you think as you gaze at the, stone faced, long haired, man in the seat across from you.  The plane rattles and shakes. Still, his gaze is fixed upon you. You wipe your brow even though it is frigid in the military cargo plane.

"Some turbulence, eh?" you offer wishing you hadn't accepted the mission.

He reaches his long delicate fingers into a small bag attached to his jeans and you unconsciously flinch. You think it is a perfectly normal reaction. You have watched Kojim's videos on vidtube and his supernatural  dexterity, reaction time, and technique paired with an unparalleled aura of coolness made him one of the most popular and dangerous men on earth. 

He takes out a pad and a pen.

"You give me autograph, please?" he asks

"Sure?" you reply.

He immediately starts taking out action figures, dvds, and posters out of the bag.

"For my friends?" he says stars in his eyes.

You quickly sign them and return to your thoughts as Kojim marvels over his haul.

This was  the fifth "world ending" mission you have embarked on and the knot in your stomach has only grown bigger each time. You know that your luck can't possibly continue.   After the first mission things snowballed and between the endorsement deals, the tv series, and talk show appearances you have found yourself in a corner. At least with the money you could commission the metallic suit you are wearing now.  With cybernetic enhancements and  a personal artificial intelligence program  it was the most cutting edge piece of technology on earth. And it was being worn by a fraud.

"Drop zone approaching!" a bodiless voice whispers in your head. 

You nod towards Koji and you both stand up.

"It is an honor to fight with you!" he says back to being a stone faced cool guy.

"Yeah, yeah, lets get this over with!" you reply.

The cargo door opens and you both jump from the plane into the murky darkness.
