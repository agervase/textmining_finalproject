 At first I thought I had woken up in a weird dream. Who wouldn't think they had woken up in a weird dream?   

  
  But this... place smelled utterly foreign to me and you don't smell in dreams anyways. My head aches horribly, heads don't ache in dreams. And the accents! Wow, but at least it's English. Those quickly dispelled the idea that maybe I just was having a very vivid dream inspired by being at the Great Western War.  As I wandered the town it became very clear that no, I was not in a dream or at some form of a reenactment event. 

  
  So many weird looks. No one was shouting or running away from me, so I must be not sticking out like a total sore thumb.  

   
  Oh right, I last remember being at GWW 2018. I'm wearing my garb. It's a 1480's Italian Gamurra and Giornea. Maybe my clothes aren't too far off  from the time period. The women here... their outer kirtles are rather sleek with waist seams, but I don't see any pleats.   

  
  Is it possible? English speaking, front lacing, minimal ornamentation, snug gowns with waist seams? Sweeeet, it looks like it's somewhere between 1470s and 1490s England. I've probably missed the Black Death! 

  
  What am I doing here though? How did I get here? This has to be a dream right? But it's not... I can smell the town (ick) and feel walls of these small thatch houses.   

  
  Where is everyone I know? My boyfriend? My cat? What about the rest of my family? Are they okay? Do they even exist? What about me? Do I exist? 

  
  Wait, some lady is walking over here. What is she saying? Damn it, over 500 years of language shifting sure does make it hard to understand her. Wait, she's asking me if I'm okay? Maybe... Maybe I can convince her I'm an Italian traveler who has gotten lost! She could help! 

  
  Yes, yes, she seems to be buying it! She's offered her hospitality. Maybe I've managed to make a friend!

  It appears I did indeed land in England in 1483! Well Shit, the War of the Roses is going still going on. My hostess and her family are moderately well off and she's happy to keep helping me figure out what happened. Though, as far as she knows I'm from Italy and know my name, but I have no memories of who my family are or how I ended up alone on the outskirts of Coventry.   

  
  While I learned how to use a drop spindle back in 2018 (and was pretty good at it) I'm a novice compared to my hostess and her daughter. And my lack of knowledge concerning the Catholic faith is causing some road blocks... but they seem to be at least willing to believe it's all related to the head injury. At least they don't think I'm a witch! I'm contributing how I can to the household, as I don't want my hosts to resent my presence.  

  
  They were kind enough to alter a gown and kirtle to fit me. So now I have one warmer outfit in addition to my linen gamurra, camicia, and giornea. 

  
  \_\_\_1 year later\_\_\_ 

  
  I've managed to learn how to fake being Catholic. I've gotten way better at spinning. And my hosts have basically adopted me. To the point where they are actively looking to find a husband for me. I'm not a total idiot, they are looking to forge ties with other important families in the area, but they are also trying to make sure I'll like my future husband. I'm not sure I'll have much choice but accept a marriage. Women don't have many rights here. As clich√© and stupid as it may sound, a good marriage might be my only chance at having a decent life in this time.     
    
    
  \_\_5 years later\_\_ 

  
  Henry Tudor, King Henry VII is now on the throne. I wonder what he's like. I've read what he's like from history book in the future, and heard the gossip on the streets. My hosts were successful in finding me a decent marriage. I've now had 2 children. How is that going to work? Am I changing the course of history by having these children? Were these children always meant to be? Will they inexplicably time travel as well? 

  
  I've learned how to spin and weave and take care of all household tasks nearly as well as a native 1489 woman. No one would look at me now and think I'm out of place. But these memories of the future... they keep me from feeling fully present. To never see my loved ones again, every day hurts.   
    
  \_\_\_10 years later\_\_\_ 

  
  I've now been here for 16 years and it is 1499. The renaissance has started in Italy. I wonder if I'll live long enough to see it. My second child died before she reached her 10th birthday. My fourth died shortly after birth. It really brought home how easy it is for people to die in this time. Infections, illness, I'm just lucky I have not succumbed to any.   
    
  \_\_\_Another 10 years\_\_\_ 

  
  It is May of 1509. King Henry VIII has started his reign! Oh boy are these people going to have an interesting life with him as a monarch. At this point I have been here for 26 years. About 5 years ago I realized I had not aged a day since I got here. That is a problem.   

  
  People now believe in witches and will kill them. I cannot be seen as a witch. If I am not aging, perhaps I'll live long enough to get into the renaissance and see some amazing things happen. But I could not do it in Coventry. I spent a couple years quietly learning to read and write in Italian, Latin, and Spanish. I squirreled away quite a bit of money, and managed to leave before anyone realized I had gone. It hurt, and still hurts to have left my children. But with accusations of witchcraft you can be guilty by association, those accusations would have happened eventually. Anyways, they are mostly grown, with my eldest already married. They will be okay. 

  
  I'm headed to Italy.
