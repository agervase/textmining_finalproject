How did my day end up like this? Everything was going so well. I had just nailed an interview for my dream job, I had stopped by for the ring I would be putting on the finger of the girl I love, heck even all the lights had been green on my way to my house. Yet all that had gone to shit.


All this was going through my mind as I speeded down main swerving between cars on my way to the hospital. What was the problem you ask? Well....


"So let me get this straight you where making toast when all of a sudden a random light blinded you and you dropped the butter knife into your foot and it stabbed through? " The Doctor asked for the 2nd time.


"Yes except the light came from the knife." I said correct him.


"Oh yes of course." The Doctor said. "can you excuse me for a moment?"


The doctor walked out and closed the door. I sat there for a second wondering why he wasn't acting faster. I finally got up and limped my way to the door to see if I could here anything.


"I don't really trust him one bit how could a butter knife cut through a a shoe and a foot. There isn't even blood and he is wearing white shoes." I could here the doctor saying on the other side.


"Why would anyone lie about that though? Maybe he is embarrassed or something about what really happened and came up with this lie?" a nurse said to him. 


"Then he stuck a butter knife in foot in place of what happened, that doesn't sound like a stable man maybe you should call some people." he said


"Damn they think I'm crazy" I whisper to myself. I look down at my foot. He is right there is no sign of blood at all. I bend down and pull the knife out of my foot as fast as I can. Again no blood at all. I looked towards the window. If I don't get out now who know what will happen? 


After getting out the window I ran to my car and got the hell out of there. On my way back I kept staring at the knife wondering what the hell had just happened. 


"Excalibur" I said to myself as I turned into my driveway.
