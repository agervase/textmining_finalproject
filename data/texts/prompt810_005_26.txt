The second I pulled the trigger, I knew something was wrong. Just something about the way he looked at me before I even drew my gun was unsettling... Not once did he look me in the eye, he only ever looked at my lower torso and occasionally his eyes would dart back and forth, and it was only after I fired my shot it dawned on me why. The entire time, his gaze followed the barrel of my gun, and his eyes were scanning what seemed to be the trajectory of the bullet. He knew what I was going to do. He knew where I’d kept my gun. He knew where the bullet would travel...

Cling. His sword, unsheathed from somewhere, had split the bullet clean in two. This fucking casual parried it. “Block this you fucking peasant” he sneered. He raised his sword and charged, straight at my face. 

There was no need to block his sword, however. It didn’t matter what he knew about guns that he wasn’t supposed to know about, no one could survive a hail of bullets at close range, and that was exactly what my gun was capable of. I switched the gun to full auto and sprayed. He flew backwards, sword still raised, his chest now a mangled mess of flesh and bone. “Fucking time travellers” he muttered as he let out his last breath. 

As for I, I never intended on marrying a princess. Heck, why would I even stay in this time period? It sucks. The only reason I came here was to mess around with dumb people of the past. Looking back on it though, I may have went a little overboard... as now people were fully convinced that witches and wizards existed... and a lot of innocent people have been burned to death or drowned. Whoops.
