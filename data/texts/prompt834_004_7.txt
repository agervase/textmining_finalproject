John woke up groggily and looked around.

It was an unfamiliar bedroom...no, hospital room. His head was pounding and there was no one around.

He could hear movement outside the room, a kind of shuffling, like somebody was dragging their feet.

He didn't seem to be hooked up to anything, so he got out of bed and got dressed, his sherrif's outfit was hanging in a nearby locker, although the gun was missing, which set off a momentary pang of concern.

He opened the door and set off into the corridor, and immediately noticed several people moving around slowly, one of them, a gray looking older man was slowly dragging his left foot down the hall. All of them look gray and lifeless, John noticed, but they either hadn't noticed him or simply paid him no mind.

A pale woman wearing a doctor's outfit approached him from the nurses station. She looked like she hadn't slept in days.

"Sheriff Beaumont. How are you feeling?" She said.

John shrugged "Feeling a bit disoriented actually, and I've got a massive headache."

"That's to be expected, you were pretty dehydrated when you came in...you know it's important to stay hydrated, especially when you're working in the sun. A man of your age should know better... how long were you out there?"

"A few hours I guess" John said sheepishly, and nodded to the man dragging his foot...Albert, an older patient John remembered from when he used to run the grocery store. 

Albert nodded back and shuffled on "Dang leg.." he muttered to himself.

"I wanted to finish the porch before my shift tonight, but those nails took longer than I thought, so many of them...and you wouldn't believe how many times I've hit my thumb today." John said as the doctor walked him to the doorway, where he retrieved his gun from a locker.

The doctor nodded and smiled at him. "Well, you know what they say about those nails, you gotta aim for the head."
