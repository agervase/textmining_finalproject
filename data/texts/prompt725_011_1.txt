I couldn't put it into words for I had never felt this way. A wave of energy surged through me as if I was 150 again. It was a youthfulness I hadn't felt in a while and one I did not want to relinquish ever again so I scarfed down all of the red balls. I had decided to call it tometa for reasons I can't explain other than it was the first word to pop up in my mind.

As one of the few humans with the rare disease xeroderma pigmentosum, my extreme sensitivity to light put me at the bottom end of the evolutionary chain. My type was on its way out. But this could be a chance at survival. 

My curiosity got the best of me: have their been other humans in prior history that have consumed natural things? Or was I just a unnatural being? I scurried through the database on my internal chipset but came across not a single mention of this. I was unique as I had always wanted to be my entire life. 

But this feeling quickly evaporated to a more painful sensation that traveled through my stomach to my pelvic. The hole lining the crack of the human anus had all but closed with scientists failing to understand what evolutionary purpose it did serve in the past. Today I found it's purpose. Little trinkets of brown goo slipped from the opening as the pain sensation was replaced by a feeling of relaxation and tranquility. 

More importantly though, I think I had answered the question that bumfuzzled science for generations. The hole was nothing more than a depository to release processed good like a dump hole on a spaceship. As such I decided to call the brown goo: dump. And I became the first human in generations to take a dump.
