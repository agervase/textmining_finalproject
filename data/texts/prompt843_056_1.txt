So here's a story for you, u/hyperspheroid. It's pretty long, and I'm not sure what to think about it. I hope you enjoy it, though. If you have any constructive criticism, I'd love to hear it.

Also, keep in mind that this is a first draft.

I have decided to keep this notebook with me throughout the whole day, because I need somewhere to vent. I do not need to vent anger, frustration, irritation, or anything in that category, instead, I need to vent my fear and anxiety. I don't expect that anyone will read this, nor do I intend for them to do so. My handwriting is that of a doctor's, and this notebook won't contain anything of importance to anyone other than myself. Heck, this isn't even important information to me.

Why am I explaining myself as if someone is reading this? Why am I paying attention to how I'm writing? Why am I writing these questions down?

I awoke this morning on my bed and saw the number. It read 7212. I don't know what is going to happen today and I hope I don't learn. I've never chosen to relive a day before. Not once. I've talked with friends who have had conversations about how big their numbers are and what made them relive a day so many times. When they ask me about my experiences, I come up empty-handed. Now I wake up one morning to see that one little number and it ruins my life and erodes in a split-second whatever security or happiness I felt when I woke up and lays down anxiety and terror in its place.

I don't want to go back again. I don't want to wake up every morning for all eternity to see that number slowly rising in both mathematical value and power- power to instill fear in the deepest corners of my heart. I don't want to die either. I'm afraid of whatever is ahead.

Is this the first time I've written my fear in a notebook? I don't know. When one goes back their memories of the day are stolen from them - the one curse of this gift; a gift which exists for better or worse. Right now, it's for worse.

I've been writing for too long. I have to get to work, I'm already late.

I nearly passed out from anxiety since the five hours I wrote last I can't stop thinking my mind just might tear from overuse I can't pay attention to my work I've made nigh on no progress with the assignments I have to complete because I've been sitting with my head in my hands eyes closed heart beating in my throat perhaps faster than the beat of a bird purely daydreaming about whatever lays in store for me at the end of the day fear of the dark is for children who know no better yet I have fallen into just that I dread the sunset the tension is rending my heart and mind I can't breathe it's an anxiety attack I can't attract attention I have to hide it thank goodness I'm sitting inside a cubicle and all the others are typing and scribbling away without a care in the world for over seven-thousand days now good for them actually no not good for them I envy them I want to feel just like them with nothing on my mind but the work which I have the capacity to pay attention to I can't do this I can't do this I CAN'T DO THIS

I'm amazed at how well a good couple of deep breaths can calm me down. I'm still on the verge of falling off Mount Sanity and suffering the bumpy ride down, but I'm still standing. Barely. I'm going to hyperventilate from deep breaths. Writing that made me laugh, something I desperately need more of. Relief, respite, relaxation, those are all words of legend now.

Why do I have to the be one with that number? Why couldn't it have been someone else? Actually, those are good questions. Did I do something to earn this? I don't think I did anything. Did whatever is comi wait a moment I remember something I think I do deserve this.

Oh, crap. I don't want to write this down. No one will read it but I don't want to write it anyways. I can't write it. But I think I know. I have to do this in my head. I can't write it down.

Well then, I have officially thrown out any hope of getting work done.

I need to leave. I'm going to talk to my boss and leave work. I think I know what's happening. I don't know if I can stop it, but I'm going to give it my best friggin' shot.

Calm down calm down. Man am I happy that deep breaths can do just that. I think that and this notebook are the only things keeping me from bawling out of stress I know I look like I'm exaggerating but I've never gone back before and now I see that I've gone back more than anyone in the world what the heck would cause me to do that I know what would cause me to do that please let it not be that make it just some good sex or something please please please don't make it this I don't want to deal with that I thought it was gone I thought I left it behind and now I think it's back it's the only thing that would make me go back so much just so I don't have to deal with it just so I don't have to live with it just so I can forget about it for another day it's worth reliving the same day forever than dealing with that I think that I'm going to go back again I know why I did it before I'm not going to do this I won't do this I'm going to go back again and live in the same day forever I can't see that again I can't I won't

I like continuous writing a lot more than writing properly. I can just get everything out of my system without having to worry about what I'm writing or how I'm writing it. No one's going to read this, not even me. No one cares about this. When I go back this will never have even existed, nothing in here will continue to be real.

I've got to steel myself now. I'm going to put this notebook in my backpack along with everything else, zip it all up, go to my boss, not nervous at all, tell him I'm leaving, and then I'm out.

I'm getting dizzy from so much deep breathing.

I'm back at work I couldn't go back home I need to be around people right now and feel safe it is what I thought it was it is it is it is I thought it was gone but it's not it's back or maybe it's been there forever and it's just come back now when will I go back home I think I have my credit card on me let me check yes I do I can get a good meal and stay out for a while longer before I go back home I just need to be around other people for a while that's all then I can go back home and have a nice relaxing sleep and wake up tomorrow and see that number isn't there anymore but it won't be should I go back or should I not I don't know I don't think I want to know right now right now I just need to calm down and eat and relax before I implode

It's what I though it is.

A/N: This is the first time I've ever used stream-of-consciousness in a story that I've shown to others (I've used it one other time) and I think it turned out pretty well. I thought for a while about using it and realized that, when used properly, it has immense potential to build incredible tension. I tried to do that with this story. Whether or not I succeeded is left up to you.

Just FYI, I am aware that I have ignored grammar rules in places which are out of a stream-of-consciousness. This is intentional.
