Cold winter wisps escaped through my bedside window and brushed against my face. I woke in an instant, instinctively looking at my Day#. 7212? How could that be? I became worried the events of the day must be so important that I was sure to mess them up. Maybe that's why, I just can't get something right... I planted my feet on the icy wood planking. 

&nbsp;

Downstairs, frosted windows lined the walls of shaded rooms, making the house feel hollow, uninviting and...cold. Nothing interesting was happening today. I might as well go back to sleep if the weather won't even hold up. So, I did. When I awakened again, the sun was down. Who would want to replay this day? I went down to make a snack.

&nbsp;

Then, a knock at the door. As I approached, I could hear the fading crunch, crunch, crunch of snow beneath feet.  Amidst the paper-white powder on my doorstep, I found a box the color of volcanic glass. Hesitant, I brought it inside.

&nbsp;

In the box, a stack of paper. The first page was blank, save for two words at the bottom of the page: "Your Choice."  When opened, I realized it was a list. Names of people I know. Friends. Family...my **entire** family. My second cousin Denise, Robby from grade school, my barber, mom, my first crush...the list was seemingly endless and complete with addresses and photographs, of everyone! I ran outside into the darkness. The footprints led to the woods and I ran through them and the deep snow. The woods were silent except the deafening crunch of snow with every step. Eventually, the footprints just...disappeared. or maybe I was blind, the moon was hidden behind storm clouds 

&nbsp;

My face red, nose leaking, and lungs stinging as I gasped for air, I made it back to my door despite the starless night sky.

&nbsp;

Inside, a man sat at my table, gun in hand, staring as if he had been waiting around for hours. Fight or flight syndrome kicked in as I demanded to know why he was in my house. Then, he spoke. And the longer he spoke, the more I realized...

&nbsp;

I was going to relive this day for the rest of my life
