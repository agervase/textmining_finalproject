"No, I'm serious. She *literally* just jumped out of the bushes, yanked down her pants, jumped on a bench and --"

I held up a hand in front of him. "*Whoa*, hand on. Imma cut you off right there. There's children around this time of day, you know?"

She looked around confused. The coffee shop was deserted but for the two of us and the regular guy working the counter. "Where?"

I thought fast, and nodded over at the counter guy, disinterestedly wiping the counter while he hummed "*Gimme Gimme Gimme*" to himself. "Over there. He looks like he has tender ears, yeah?"

She glanced over at him. "I suppose, yeah," she said, as Greg twirled and hit a high note. Inwardly, I sighed. Everyone thinks they're a star.

"Anyway," she continued, "I pushed her away, and hollered for the cops." She looked defensive as I raised an eyebrow. "Look, that *literally* happened. Here," she said, fumbling her phone from her bag, "I figured you might not believe me, so I got a picture of her." She held up her phone, and sure enough, I could see a figure running down the park path. Hmm.

"OK, so what do you want to do about it?" I asked.

"I already talked to the police," she said, and I nodded. So would I, first chance I got. What that woman had done was *way* out of line. "But that literally isn't even the craziest thing that happened to me this week."

"Oh? What else has been going on?"

"A couple of days ago, Mom finally told me that my parents' friend Stephen - the guy I've been calling Uncle Steve my whole life - is literally my uncle. He literally is! And that's not the worst of it!" Her throat caught as she bit back a sob. "He's also my father! And my dad's *OK* with it! Literally OK!" Her face twisted as she looked away for a second. "*And*...and-and-and he and Uncle Steve have been having an *affair!*" She wailed, as tars started rolling down her cheeks. "And that's not all!"

"Oh, please go *on*," I gestured.

"John comes home two days ago with the kids, only Tim isn't Tim - it's some *other* kid, literally! - but he says it's Tim! And Tim says he's Tim, and the neighbors say he's Tim, and the *school* says he's Tim and the whole *world* says he's Tim but *he isn't Tim!* He *looks* a bit like Tim, but he's *not* my *son!*", she wailed, beating her fist against her thigh. "Everyone looks at me like I'm crazy, but I'm not!" She held up her phone again, and showed me a picture or herself and her kids from last year. "Is that Tim, or isn't it?" she demanded.

I looked to the photo, and then back to her. "Um...yes, actually. That *is* Tim," I said, as gently as I could.

"No! It! Isn't!" she screamed, hurling her phone at the poor guy manning the counter. I winced as it bounced off the side of his head, rocking him for a second. That was going to come out of the budget. Then forgot about him as I turned my attention back to her, rocking slowly in her chair, repeating through her tears, "And to top it off, I *swear* I had fucking *aliens* in my bedroom last night, standing around my bed talking about me!" She buried her head in her arms. "I'm *not* crazy. I'm *not* crazy. I'm **not** crazy..."

"Hey," I said, leaning forward and resting my hand on her shoulder, "Hey. It'll be OK. Give me a sec, OK? I have to use the washroom." I rose, and quickly went to the washroom at the back of the shop. Once there, I pulled out my phone and made a quick call.

Poor ratings or not, this story arc had to end. I argued hard for just leaving things the way they were or canceling it altogether in the first place - reality TV really was in the dumpster end of entertainment anyway - and giving the poor woman the truth, but who listens to the producer anymore? 

Sighing, I stopped mid-dial, and let the phone drop to my side. Fuck it. I was *literally* too tired to deal with this any longer. 

I sat on the toilet lid, and waited for the show security to find me.
