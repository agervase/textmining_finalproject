Look, I'm a necromancer, not a priest.

I'm just as weirded out as you are when it comes to this. 

I was experimenting with "Raise Dead" the other day, and I accidentally raised a tire. It's rolling around like some sort of weird dog. It also growls and purrs. Don't ask. But it's sorta growing on me.

Then I accidentally raised a battery. Not a very big one, mind. It was only a triple A battery. They're not the most obedient things, but it's one way to extend a charge. And no, I'm not going to cast that spell so you can use your wireless keyboard for another week.

Speaking of wireless keyboards... yeah. They scream like banshees and are about as ambulatory as one. Dangerous stuff. You don't really want to know what's inside them.

No, don't ask me to animate your fridge, car, bike, whatever. I've got my hands full with moving appliances in my own damn house. By Vecna's severed hand, I didn't know "Raise Dead" had a RADIUS OF EFFECT. And that it also animates houses. I guess I know how that idiot adventurer feels when the dread gazebo finally attacked him. My house just did the same thing.

And then there's the fact that it also works on human relationships, weird political ideas and even the entirety of Ayn Rand's literature. No, it's not going to suddenly gain a million fans. I'm a necromancer, remember? They all become adorable little ghost animals. Plenty of ghost hamsters, a fair few ghost ferrets, the odd ghost corgi, ghost guinea pigs, ghost rats (I didn't know dead business deals would be... oddly affectionate), ghost cats...

Well, would you like to adopt a ghost pet? They're mess-free and don't need to be fed! And as much as I love ghost animals, having a zoo of them isn't the most comfortable thing in the world.
