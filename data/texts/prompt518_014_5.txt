At first it seemed like a wonderful idea.

 Professor Henry Doofenshmirtz had finally stopped trying to be evil, and made some contraptions that could benefit society. He reduced our carbon footprint, cured HPV globally, and even made a pill that would dissolve belly fat.

The most amazing invention was a work born of pain. A work born of the loss he felt at his long time companion, Norm's, death. He was hit by a public tram, and Henry never had a chance to say goodbye. He never got to tell Norm how much he really meant, though their work together spanned decades.

Henry went to work. He would make a machine to change death itself. No one would ever feel his pain again. Now, when a loved one was dying, you would be teleported to their side an hour before the end. You could make your peace, and say your goodbyes.

Unfortunately, a fishing vessel ran aground the reef of a small island in the Pacific the same day Henry unleashed his machine. The crew, 12 men and half as many women, we're marooned.

Their supplies dwindled, and soon they were on the verge of starvation. Over the course of 30 minutes, all their friends and family arrived to console them.

Tears were shed and loving words traded. The sailors began to slowly die off, one by one.

Unfortunately... the island was no more hospitable for their loved ones. several hundred people were trapped on am island not 500m across. They too slowly succumbed to hunger, until their friends, families, other loved ones began to appear.

Within a week, the small island became a heap of bodies so wide and deep no land could be seen. 

No human life remained anywhere on the glov
be. 7 billion corpses, teleported in an unending train of love and despair. The entire species destroyed by an act of love.
