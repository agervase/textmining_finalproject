Two names.

When I was about 17 my parents told me about the names that were located on my lower back, I never noticed them and no one ever saw them as I was very self conscious. My parents read the names out to me very carefully, Jackie, and Aubrey. I wrote them down on a piece of paper I stored away very carefully. I knew now that the woman I was with was not going to be the love of my life nor my killer, over the next few months I cut ties with her, not being able to explain why I just knew I had to.

Fast forward about 3 years, my 20th birthday I was with some friends at bar, I wasn’t much of a drinker but I would on occasion. I was having a great time with my friends but as the night moved forward I met a girl named Aubrey, thinking too much about it I didn’t know where to start cause she could have been my killer, but she wasn’t. I introduced myself and instantly her eyes grew wide and right then I knew she was my soulmate. Jackie wasn’t a very common name where I lived so it was pretty easy to stay away from any Jackie’s.

Fast forward another few years, me and Aubrey are married and we are driving to California to meet up with her family, listening to the radio and having a great time, arguing about silly things but for fun. I was just giving her a hard time, maybe too hard of a time as she looked at me, filled with rage she grabs the wheel and tugs right, I tug left and back and forth we are sliding on the road, trying to keep us alive I never noticed the sign that said “Dead End” and in a sudden instance, *Crash* we hit the wall at 80 mph, we were both hospitalized and later both passed away. The name on my arm that said Aubrey wasn’t my lover, we were meant to kill each other. The doctor who was treating me was named Jackie... my soul mate....
