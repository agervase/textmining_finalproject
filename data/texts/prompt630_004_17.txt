Stop biting! Please stop biting!

Weird, I'm pretty sure I've seen dozens of zombie movies and TV shows. I don't recall any, where the zombies actively didn't want you to bite them. Hell, the thought grosses me out to no end. And yet, here I am, for what feels like the hundredth time, fighting the urge to bite these bastards. You ever have one of those really bad dreams, the ones that are so scary that's there's no way it's real, and you realize, but that doesn't change the fact that you can't do anything about it. So you run, or jump, or scream, or cut, or in my case, bite, in the dream, all the while willing yourself to wake up... but you don't. At least not usually till the alarm goes off or that really bad something happens. Well, I'm there again, or at least I wish I was, I'm pretty sure this time it's real. Except, I know it's real and all the willing to wake up isn't helping any, nor do i have that aching fear of the alarm going off. There is no alarm, there is no dream, there's just me, these zombies, and my desire to bite the shit out of them.

It's been something like 2 or 3 years now since I got here. I honestly, don't remember how it all happened. The glimpses that I do get from before the so called apocalypse are short and fleeting, and they themselves feel like a dream. I can see my parents reaching out after me, as I'm rushed into the back of an ambulance, and I remember the sirens as we drove through a city in ruins. I can still feel the sense of relief I felt when they hid us inside the hospital and gave us all the vaccine, or the anti-zombie serum, or whatever it was. That warm relaxing rush. It's one of the few good memories I have of hiding out in this place. I think being hurried into a secure hospital and not being able to leave beause of what was out there, might just have been worse then being left to the zombies. Not being able to see the sun for more than a few hours at a time will drive any man crazy.

Don't bite us, damnit, stop you'll hurt yourself.

Maybe it's time I give in. Maybe it's time I let these bastards get me. What could be worse than this? I mean, I have no life here. I figure it makes sense to preserve humanity, but let me serve my own food, I don't need it given to me 3 times a day. Let me take my own vitamins when I damn well want to, I don't need you to tell me when to take my vitamins. It's one thing to control a man's diet, it's another to make him pee in a cup. And it's altogether another to make him go to sleep and turn off his lights for him, like he was some godamn inmate. I don't care about the fucking future of humanity, I don't even care about my parents or even myself... if I'm going to go down, I'm going down fighting, I'll take a mouthful of their rotten flesh...

AAAAAAAHHHHHH... they got me. Did they get me? They get a chunk of my arm...

&#x200B;

Please, relax... calm down. You're going to be ok.

&#x200B;

There it is, that warm and fuzzy feeling again, like the day, just like the day I got here. It starts in my arm, and spreads like a warm blanket over me. So quickly, so calming. Am I waking up, or falling asleep. I don't even know anymore.

Mr. Dosil, you're having another episode.

&#x200B;

You, how are you human? I bit you, or you bit me, this...

&#x200B;

Mr. Dosil, you bit yourself, again... remember, there are no zombies Mr. Dosil.------------------------------------------------------------------

This was my first post ever. I've never written anything before, nor do I write, pretty much at all. This WP though was really cool and got me thinking. So, I guess I'm hoping I don't get torn to shreds for a bad piece. Anyhow, this was a great WP, and I'm not even a zombie fan.
