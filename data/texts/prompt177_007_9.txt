Out in the parking lot, a women in a hospital gown with brunt and frizzy dull brown hair was wielding a metal rake. Quickly her arms would bring the rake upward and with an excellent force she would hammer down the rake on the hood of MY car, a piercing sound reminiscent of nails on a chalkboard screeched out as she dug the metal blades into the red paint and pulled outward. As I observed the spectacle, l very slowly, and admittedly, very cautiously approached the women. I got close enough to where I could hear her ranting under her breath:

"Well you see. they aren't really cars at all. No, they aren't cars, they are giant bugs! Surely you realize this? I mean I have had this pounding in my head for two weeks straight...or a thought, rather...causing the pounding in my head and a feeling that I haven't been able to shake off. Just KNOWING that they are out HERE, out here in the mid summer sun basking in the heat, scurrying down the streets and holding the entire city hostage. And the fact that no one, and I mean absolutely NO ONE, seems to care! Can you believe it? Has the whole world gone mad? Well, maybe the whole world HAS gone mad, but as for me, I refuse to stand by idle, something HAD to be done.  I've been addressing the problem you know, but the exoskeleton of these arthropods is too much for my little rake to bare......but wait.....if I speak like that I will admit defeat! Don't you worry! I will put an end to this lunacy once and for all, I will free this entire metropolis from the terror of these giant insects! If I could only locate a bigger rake, or maybe a sledgehammer! Surely a sledgehammer would kill these bastards off once and for all! And FINALLY, after so much pacing and so much racing, the world will be rid of these monstrosities! And the pounding in my head will completely cease!"

Just another day in a world gone mad.
