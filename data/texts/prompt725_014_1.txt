Barefoot, I make my way through the forest to the river, feeling the spongey moss between my toes. A few months ago, I had gotten a tip from a coworker about this location. The sunlight that filters down through the city smog could never compete to the pure, unadulterated sunlight that shines down here, and so I had been making a trip to the middle of nowhere at least once a week ever since. As I reach the rocky bed of the mountain river I roll my pant legs up to wade to the middle of it, cautiously feeling my way across the slippery stones beneath, arms spread wide in attempt to keep my balance. In its center sits a large, flat rock with more than enough room for me to lay spread eagle on it. I de-robe and feel the warmth of the rock against my back and the sun against my face as I bask in the nourishment.

My thoughts trail off and I don't realize that I am lost in them until I hear a *plunk* that startles me back to reality. I hastily sit up and look around, clutching my shirt to my chest. I scan the forest edge and see nothing. I similarly scan the rippling surface of the water and see nothing. I am about to lay back down, trying to ignore the prickle that's tickling the back of my neck, when I see a man step out of the shadows. He has long, shoulder length brown hair and the beard that frames his face is close cut. He is dressed in the natural, muted colors of nature and his skin is dark like those who have to work twice as hard to absorb their nutrients from the sun.  I freeze, not sure what to make of him. I had been coming here for months and had never stumbled upon anybody.

We have both been assessing each other for seconds that stretch on like minutes when I finally call out to him, "Hello?" He raises a hand in greeting, slightly lowering his head in a nod. I smirk and wave back before putting my arms through the sleeves of my shirt and pulling it over my head. Keeping my head down while shimmying my jeans on, I peak at him sideways and see that he is still standing there watching me. I straighten up and glance over my shoulder towards him again. As I do, I watch him tip his head back and toss something into his mouth. His jaw clenches several times before the muscles in his neck move and he swipes the back of his hand across his lips. My head unconsciously cocks sideways, eyebrows furrowed together in confusion. "D'ya want some?" he asks. He unclips a pouch from his belt and opens the mouth of it with both hands. Shaking the bag to view its contents better he reaches in and pulls out a handful of something. He extends his hand, palm up, but I can't quite make out what is is that he's showing me. "What is it?", I ask, skepticism clear in my voice. "Berries", he states, giving me a one-shouldered shrug. *Berries?* I'm more confused now than ever. "I don't understand...what are you doing?" He chuckles and pops this second handful of "berries" into his mouth. Wiping his hands on his pants he reclips the pouch to his belt before rolling his pant legs above his knees.

He steps into the water sure-footed and is jumping up onto my rock in no time. I am amazed with both his speed and agility. His eyes register the surprise on my face and he gives me an easy smile. "Here", he grabs my hands and shapes them into a cup before grabbing his pouch once more and tipping some of its contents into my hands. Small, round, dark blue balls roll out and I look up at him with an eyebrow raised, "Okay? These are berries then. So what? What do you do with them?" He shrugs, "You eat them. Just take one, put it in your mouth, chew and swallow." He grabs a single ball out of the pile and holds it up to his mouth, slowly going through the motions of chewing and swallowing for me. "See? Easy as that." I'm still not convinced and my body language is transmitting my distrust, "But why? What does it do?" He smiles at me then, big and beaming and full of unrestrained glee, "You're going to have to tell me, sweetheart. It seems to do something a little bit different for all of you Sun Soakers."
