It was to be the end. Death picked up his scythe and turned to his greatest foe. Resignation covered her face. She, too, knew it was to be the end.

She was crafty and spiteful. Death respected that. Given any chance she would strike back. Death turned to her and started to sing.

"Hello Life, my old friend.

I've come to show you to your end

Like, a vision softly creeping

you sowed your seeds while I was sleeping

And the creators that you imposed in my void had me annoyed

But now it ends in  silence"

Her reply was swift.

"Through endless dreams I walked alone

Stars and fire and gas and stone

Beside the halo of a quasar

Planted a seed that spread so far

While your eyes were distracted by the flash of starlight

I started life

To end the hell of silence"

Death smiled. He wasn't sure if his foe could be killed, but he knew she could be broken.

"And in the faint light you saw

A quintillion souls, maybe more

People dying without screaming

People hoping, but so fleeting

Souls moving on, beyond the boundaries of this world

Their screams unheard

Now left alone in silence

Foolish Life, you did not know

They rest now where you won't go

Hear my words and I might teach you

Come with me and I'll let you

Go with your children to their new world

And end their eternal silence

Your children beg and scream and pray

For Life to visit them again"

Life imagined her children, their souls stuck in an eternity without her. She could not bear the thought, and so embraced the sound of silence, forever.

Death smiled. His ruse had worked. Life could not be ended, it could only end itself. He had just needed to show Her the way.
