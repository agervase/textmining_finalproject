"Wah?"

"The unlicensed vendor you purchased your wallet from."

I looked down at my wallet, far more concerned about needing to replace the ID and stuff, as it was otherwise all cards. So why was it bleeding?

"W-wa- Vendor?" I tried, his gun still smoked a little and was leveled on my Italian Leather Trifold. Now leaking strawberry jam; though I knew there was no stray packet of condiment.

"A Mimic laid her eggs in his box of knock off consumer goods."

I was only half listening: my wallet had begun to writhe around, trying to inchworm away. But the 9mm bullets had torn it up pretty bad, and it toppled over making me jump far more than it should have.

"Yeah, some poor bastard just lost a finger when his fake Nikes decided they didn't want to be put on."

I stared and watched my wallet adopt a slithering hop, which unexpectedly made my assailant-turned-protector bolster his gun.

"Great! I only wounded it; let's follow."

I watched dumbfounded as the tattered remains of my billfold found it's stride and began to hustle. Any on looker would have watched two unlikely friends following a piece of windblown trash.

"This is Great! I've never seen one locomote like this before! We always assumed a spore or seed but that things imitating a brown paper bag caught in the wind!"

While shock and disbelief still held my tongue I grunted in agreement: it a matter seconds the fine tan leather had taken on the texture of crumpled paper and darkened to match.

"The fellows of The Cryptozoology Society will be thrilled! Must be a larval stage; goodness knows the full-sized ones are bait-pounce predators. 

That snapped me out of it.

"Full sized?" 

"Goodness yes. In the Middle Ages they seemed to prefer chests and barrels; modern Mimics like to assume the form of abandoned, expensive luggage."
