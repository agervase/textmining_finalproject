My eyes are heavy, I can feel the world spinning around me as I desperately try to make sense of my surroundings. How on Earth did this happen? How long have I been drinking? 

*"Had enough yet my dear?"* 
Her voice cuts through the mumbles of those around us. Crisp, clear and without a hint of a slur, she leans forward and looks me in the eyes,
*"Cause I'm just getting started"* 

Her soft and yet somehow unnerving words sober me enough to remember the task at hand. I must out drink her. I can't let her win. I don't know what, but something awful will happen if I let this woman walk free from this table having finished more mugs than I. 

*"Ay, bar keep, bring us--*
I hold back the vomit as my body heaves against the very words coming from my lips,
*"Another round"*

*"I think this an unwise choice"* my companion whispers beside me. I hear a hint of fear in his voice. I wonder if I should keep this up. I wonder how *long* I can keep this up. 

*"Tsk tsk. Silly boy, when will you learn? God has given me but one task and you think you can stand in the way?"* 

The bar keep drops 2 more mugs near us and backs away quickly, averting his eyes. No one moves a muscle. My head is killing me, if only I could sleep. Just for a while...

*"Hurry up now, don't keep me waiting"* 

I hear gasps amoungst the crowd and before I can grab my beer, the woman has swallowed the lot down her dark gullet. She stares at me with intense eyes. 

*"Oh come on, darling. Don't make me beg. Just bring the mug to your lips and up, up, up the glass!"* She laughs in a deep and silky voice. I'm very tired. Just one more mug...

*"What is your-- ugh-- your name woman. I never did ask"* Anything, I need anything to keep her busy. I need a moment to recollect my thoughts.

*"Stalling won't help you now, my love. But I'll give you a break, seeing as you look about ready to drop dead. It's Dionysus, but my friends call me Diana. Pleasure to make your acquaintance"*
