I'm leaning against a tree, one of many in the endless forest of limbo, hands behind my head, a permanent grin stuck onto my face. "Heya Death." I wiggle my eyebrows at the imposing hooded figure standing before me, pitch black robes hiding his body and face. "Been... What? 40, maybe 50 years since you last saw me?" I chuckled, and Death groaned in exasperation. "Aw, you're no fun."

"You know, one day your luck is going to run out." Death grumbles. "And you'll spend eons wandering this place for trying to escape your fate. A century for every life you've lived."

I looked around at the endless forest of nothingness and grimaced. "Yeah, that doesn't sound like much fun, so go ahead and flip. I'm feeling lucky."

Death waved a bony hand and procured a silver coin out of thin air. "Call it in the air."

"I know the drill." I respond, eyes closed. I wait until I hear the silver clicking against the bone of his fingers. It's in the air now. I feel a rush of adrenaline course through me, the unease, God, what a feeling! Without hesitating I make a call, "Tails." It's so quiet that I hear the coin fall onto the ground.

"Take a look." Death murmurs, and I push myself off the tree.

"Don't need to." I answer. "Go ahead and send me back at 19. I wanna relive my college years."

Death is silent for a while. "I believe you're mistaken." His words make my heart stop.

My voice escapes me in a whisper. "What.. Do you mean?"

"See for yourself." Then he's gone, and I'm alone.
It takes a minute for me to be able to move, and I shakily crouch down, picking the coin up from the black grass. The truth is facing up at me. Heads.
I drop the coin as if it's burnt me and stand up.

"Death!" I scream into the nothingness of the shadow sky. "You can't keep me here, send me back!"
A faint chuckle on the wind is the only response I receive.
