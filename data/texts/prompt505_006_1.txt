The inn sat upon a low hill overlooking the fjord, and the wan red light of dusk filtered through the windows. The inn had no name, and no one seemed to know when it was built; it had always been there. 

Inside, Thor slouched lazily across the wooden chair, regarding the stout woman who stood in front of him with hands on hips.

"You say you can drink any of us under the table, eh?" Thor grinned. A few of the others at his table chuckled softly.

The woman grinned back, dark eyes flashing. "When you all are drunk upon the floor, I will just be getting started!"

"That's a mighty boast, lady," said Thor, still grinning, 'especially in this house. Before we consider your challenge, tell us your name."

The woman responded in a voice that was as unnatural as it was loud. "I am THE MACHINE!" She looked around the table, as if expecting a response. There was a pause, then every man at the table burst into laughter--save one, who sat stone-faced and silent.

Thor glanced slowly to his left at the stone-faced man, whose long white hair and flowing beard fell nearly to the floor. 

"What say you, Aegir? Have you had your fill yet tonight?" Thor glanced back at the woman, eyes twinkling.

The man stood up slowly, almost as if unfolding himself. When he stood, he towered many heads over the woman--and everyone else in the room. 

"Despite many days at sea, I thirst", he said, in a voice that sounded like the low rumble of approaching thunder. The woman jerked her head upward at the impossibly tall man, startled. Recovering quickly, she thrust out her chin. 

"Enough talk! We drink." Looking over her shoulder towards the bar, she yelled "bring us ale, barkeep--all that you have!" Turning back to the table, she smiled wickedly, a look of satisfaction on her face.

The tall man slowly put up a hand. "No", he said, swinging his arm around to point out the window towards the deep fjord outside. "We start drinking *there*".
