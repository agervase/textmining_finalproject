The message from beyond had caused a stir. This was unsurprising, humanity had a knack for taking unexpected events and overreacting to them. It was something of a specialty within the species, a rare piece of unifying commonalia that allows us to just barely inhabit this earth with one another.

We had always made a number of assumptions about first contact. We assumed the interlopers would be foreign. That they would be vastly different from us in terms of appearance, manner and culture.

We also sort of assumed they would contact us through means other than Facebook.

But alas, there's a well known saying that goes along with assuming: it makes you look like an idiot. I think that's how it goes. I can't say I'm much of a student on these matters. I was just the first person to receive the Facebook message.

**"Greetings, Colony #037. We are glad to see you survived. The others all ran out of resources. May we come over?"**

It came from someone I didn't recall adding to my friends. Oddly enough, the person was friends with my entire friends list, which was an obscenely unlikely occurrence. I guessed the bots had just figured out a new hack to pillage my personal data and spew it all over the world.

Still, I was intrigued. Normally it was just penis pills or escort services they were pushing on me. I'd never seen an intergalactic angle before.

"Hey, yeah. Come over. I just ordered Pizza. It's Papa John's, so don't expect much." I replied, tapping the send button and taking a moment to click through a few posts of people in dire need of interwebs validation. I appended a few angry emojis in places where it made no sense, like a baby announcement from my mom's friend. Mild chaos was something of a hobby for me.

"We will require approximately seven hundred and thirty eight square miles to accommodate the surviving travelers. Is this possible?" My newfound internet bot friend replied.

Hmmm...I decided to play along. I didn't have anything else going for me until the pizza arrived anyways. "Sure, Canada has a lot of space. You can just plunk down there."

"Curious. You are authorized to permit this Donald Trump?" I'd changed my name a few months past so I could troll my aunt who was...less than enthusiastic about the current state of politics. I mostly just replied with "Sad!" to all her posts. She hated it.

It was awesome.

"Yeah, no problem. They're all super nice and polite. They'll probably apologize for getting in your way." I responded.

"This is a great relief. We shall send an advance party to establish the colonization zone. Thank you for your hospitality, our internal modeling did not suggest such a hospitable and rational welcome."

"Oh, yeah, we're pretty cool about this stuff. It happens all the time honestly."

There was a long pause before the dots indicating typing appeared again, "Your colony has been...approached by other off-worlders?"

"I can't really talk about our other relationships. I'm a gentlemen."

"But...have you been infected? Have the Zimdrei infiltrated you? Is your world in chaos?"

I snorted, "Man, it's always going to hell down here. We have no idea what we're doing, but I'm pretty sure we got that way on our own. Don't worry about it. Just park it in Ontario and shoot me a note when you're coming for pizza."

Another long pause. "Very well, we have no choice. Our resources are exhausted and the survival of this colony was only discovered by a happy coincidence. We are in no position to bargain."

"Cool." Thumbs up emoji.

The bell rang and I went to grab the pizza. After paying, I settled down in front of the TV, pizza box resting on my knees. I flipped on the set and pried open the box, selecting a piece the seemed to have congealed the least in the journey. After a moment of warming up, the Simpsons popped into view.

Nice.

I brought the piece to my mouth just a breaking news bulletin flashed across the screen. The Simpsons faded from view and a harried, pale newscaster appeared. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the world, we are not alone." A video began to play in the background, it showed dozens of odd oval objects descending from the sky. "Moments ago, in Ontario, Canada, dozens of unidentified flying objects entered into the planet's atmosphere. They have settled down in a small area. The President of the United States is coordinating with Canadian officials and the United Nations on a response, with an announcement expected within the hour."

He took a deep breath, "Again, we are not alone."

The pizza slice hung in the air, an inch from my slack-jawed maw. I stared at the screen. Slowly, the pizza found its home in my mouth. I chewed the decidedly mediocre bite thoughtfully. Well, this was unexpected.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I reached down and fished it out, I had a notification from Facebook. I opened it up, "We have arrived."

No shit.

I hit the like button.
