*Eminem rises from a diamond platform to a stage made of steel and gold, heâ€™s wearing a white suit with a black tie. A sick beat drops.*
 
&nbsp; 

Planets on the smash, moons on stash  
Lava got me growing way too fast, way too fast  
Evolution the solution, dinosaurs on blast, can you even imagine this all used to be gas  
Species throwing feces got a real hot mess, plates on the run but I digress

&nbsp;  


*The stage dims, fog enters.*

&nbsp;  

Who am I? I don't want to be me! Who am I, I don't want to be me!  
Self identification, a bastardization, of a former reflex or sensation  
Night on the run got my stone packed a ton  
Fear the leader, but the leader fears me  
Fight the fear but the fear can see  

&nbsp;
  
*Lights burst open, fire shoots into the sky.*

&nbsp;
  
I... don't want to be a chimney sweep, just to make ends meet   
It's only when you feel the heat, do you know my grief    
I only want to see you cry... my motto is I'll never die!

&nbsp;
  
*Loud low timbre drum strikes, machine gun fire sounds.*  
*Dr. Dre rises next to Eminem wearing a black suit with a gold tie and picks up the mic.*

&nbsp;
  
Dre: What do you say to somebody you hate?!  
Em: What Dre? I mean you know I'd wait, careful planning, science shit... man I'd salivate  
Dre: Drop the bomb on 'Em', Drop the bomb on 'Em'

&nbsp;
  
*Dre becomes enveloped in a particle field and raised up into the peak of the stage now providing backup*  
*Eminem now with "spacey" voice modulation.*

&nbsp;
  
Coming in too hot, the challenge has been brought, do you even know how many battles we've fought!!!

&nbsp;
  
*Dre now enveloped in intense energy, bursts with intense light, the stage, being a omnidirectional split quark blast cannon, had now...* **stood up**.   *Eminem still rapping descends into a variety of tongues, the intense Hawking and Gamma radiation emanating from the cannon disrupting his primary functions,* **the war against the alien race was over but at what cost?**
