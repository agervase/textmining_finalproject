Wanheda was her name, death was how she reigned.

My people used to rule the forest and the mountains, until Wanheda came from the sky to ruin it all. It was clear she was too advanced, my people did not want to admit how inferior we were in terms of technology. I abandoned them, sought for peace and happiness instead of fighting pointless battles in clans.

Then it happened. I stumbled across a glowing box. I stare at it, *"Ancient technology"* I say in astonishment. I play with it for a while until I accidentally find out how to use it, my ancestor's wisdom must have came in and empowered me.
I watched as pictures and words filled the screen, and that's when I see it. But what is it? A tiny ancient technology? I pick it up and look at it dumbfounded. Its so small, this can't be worth anything, why is it here? What did they do with something so tiny? I was about to smash it, then it hit me, I plugged it inside the glowing box. I watch as many words and pictures flicker,  I am stunned.

I learn many things and continue to study it nonstop for the next year. I learned how to keep its power on forever and build more technology. I learned that the great big wall was actually started by a man named Donald Trump after a lot of controversy. I learned of Space and Science, Music and Art, Literature, Video Games, Memes, *Reddit*. So much information in this tiny device, with this... I could restore mankind and save all the clans! I cloned the USB drive 100 times, this should be enough. Then I sent them out to 100 young fresh minds along with portable chargers and laptops to test the effects of all this knowledge. 

20 years later we found fighting was the reason we ended up like this "If we don't end war, war will end us" became what we lived by, we restored mankind to the year of 2067 and made sure not to make the same mistakes that led us here.
