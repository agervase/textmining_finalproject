I was stunned. That apparition’s proposal seemed simply too good to be true. Doubt – or maybe it was skepticism – crept into my mind, churning away at the potential … and the risk. “You mean to tell me, you will grant me one – just one wish … anything I want?”


&nbsp;

 
The apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin – too charming. “That’s about the size of it, mortal.” He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness – a graveled, singsong tenor – as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. 


&nbsp;


“But at what cost?” I asked, turning my attention to the brass vessel from whence he came, taking refuge from his countenance in the filigree etched into its contours. In those etchings I found some odd sense of peace. When I returned my attention to the apparition, he merely shrugged. 
“None that I could hold over you, mortal.” Once the wish is made, I’ll hold no power over you. From there, what you make of your wish is up to you.”



&nbsp;


“Right … I’d like a do-over, then. I want to go back and change my greatest mistake.”
The apparition sighed, eyes rolling as he ran his fingers through his hair. “Are you sure, mortal? Is that all you want?” He paused, shaking his head. “No riches? No power?”



&nbsp;


I shook my head. 



&nbsp;


“Knowledge?” 



&nbsp;


“Not even women?”



&nbsp;


“Men?”



&nbsp;


“Neither.” I answered. “I just want to go back and correct my biggest mistake.”



&nbsp;


Again the apparition sighed, shoulders slumped in resignation. “Very well, mortal … your wish is granted.”
In an instant, my world was consumed by light.



&nbsp;


Something about this seemed all too familiar. I was stunned of course. The apparition’s proposal seemed simply too good to be true. “You mean to tell me, you will grant me one – just one wish … anything I want?” 



&nbsp;


The apparition nodded, thin lips curling into a charming wry grin – too charming. “That’s about the size of it, mortal.” He answered. His words echoed through my consciousness – a graveled, singsong tenor – as if every syllable hinted of Damocles. 
Something about his words send a chill down my spine. “Déjà vu” I muttered, thrusting my hands in my pockets as I looked away. 



&nbsp;


“What was that?” The apparition demanded.



&nbsp;


“This all just feels familiar. Déjà vu all over again.”  At that, he just laughed.



&nbsp;


“What? What’s so funny?” 



&nbsp;


“You begin to see, mor—“



&nbsp;


“ALBERT! My name is Albert, not ‘mortal.’ ” The apparition clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, speaking through gasps and snorting chortles as he attempted to collect himself. “I know – you’ve told me! – HA! More than once!”



&nbsp;


“Look, I don’t see what’s so funny about all this. I know I told you. Just now!”



&nbsp;


“Ha! More than that, mor—“



&nbsp;


“ALBERT!”



&nbsp;


“Fine, fine, Professor. We’ve been at this game long enough.” 
This game? Something about those words felt … wrong. Feeling faint, I found myself slumping weakly into my chair. Dizzy, heedless of the clutter, I lay my head on the desk.



&nbsp;


“Oh poor, dear Albert” the apparition began. “It must seem like nothing makes sense anymore. We’ve been at this game for so long now.”



&nbsp;


“It’s hardly been ten minutes.” I muttered.



&nbsp;


“Ten minutes upon tens of minutes, upon tens of minutes and more.”



&nbsp;


“What are you going on about?” He snorted in amusement, clacking his teeth several times. When I looked up, he stood arms akimbo, my favorite pipe suspended between his lips.



&nbsp;


“Professor. This isn’t Déjà vu, as you say. This is real, and you’ve made that wish – well, never-mind how many times. Suffice to say, too many.” 



&nbsp;


“You mean I’ve made the same wish, and every time I do, you bring me back here to do it over again?”



&nbsp;


“I only grant the wish. It’s you who brings us back here.” He replied, drawing my pipe from his lips to pack it.



&nbsp;


“I – I believe I understand.”



&nbsp;


“Not quite!” He laughed, lighting my pipe and drawing deeply from the stem. Exhaling, he smiled. “Revelation … House of Windsor, yes?”



&nbsp;

I nodded.



&nbsp;


“Right – Listen, Professor. Right now, and for the past sixteen hours, you’ve had the power to change anything, be anything, and do anything.” He began, puffing idly. “You wanted to change only one aspect of your life, when you could change – for better or worse – the lives of millions. In your heart you know that, otherwise we wouldn’t keep coming back to this moment. So Professor” he inhaled deeply, expelling the smoke in my direction. “Make a change.”



&nbsp;


“You mean, make it count.”



&nbsp;


“Precisely!”



&nbsp;


Suddenly, I felt as if the weight of the world were on my shoulders and, in that moment I knew my fears to be true. The sword of Damocles had indeed been hanging over me. Standing, I could feel my legs shake under this new burden. I began to pace.



&nbsp;


“Well?” the apparition questioned, offering a freshly packed pipe. I accepted, lighting it readily and inhaled deeply in preparation for what I was about to ask. “I want …” I began, my voice trailing nervously. 



&nbsp;


“Go on, Professor.” He encouraged.



&nbsp;


Taking another deep draw from my pipe, I then set it on the desk. Resolving myself, I looked to the apparition, exhaling. “I want to kill Hitler.”



&nbsp;


His wry grin widened, letting out a chortle as he slapped my back. “DONE!”



&nbsp;


In an instant, my world was consumed by light.



&nbsp;


I looked up from my desk, unable to concentrate. [The sound of marching drawing ever closer until it seemed as if the very walls of my study shook and resounded with the drumming and stomping of soldier’s feet. It was then I heard it, the distant command that would tear Europe asunder.
