"You?"

The erstwhile "God" was looking at me in horror. 

"Yeah me! You've only been God the last few thousand games, and Devil is getting kinda boring."

George, my best friend and playmate, crossed his arms. 

"Why'd I want to be the boring Devil then, huh?"

I shrugged. I didn't usually argue with George when he got into a mood, but I was really and truly over getting beaten at a rigged game. 

"First, because being Devil might be interesting if God...mixed things up a bit. And second, because I thought you were all about that fairness and stuff..."

I trailed off as George rose to his feet, round face glowing dangerously. 

"Those are my rules for THEM, silly! How have you played thousands of Devils without realizing that THE RULES FOR GODS ARE DIFFERENT!!"

Course, I had definitely noticed that George's "rules" for Gods were different. It hadn't taken me more than 3 rounds to figure out that George had no rules for George at all. I didn't really care, at first; I enjoyed a challenge as well as the next Devil. But then he started making his beings sentient and eventually I realized he wasn't ever going to change. 

George wasn't just a bully to his sentient creations. It had taken me a hundred games to screw up the courage to say anything, but this last round had been so horrific even my cowardice was no object. 

"Well," I shrugged, "there are no rules for Devils."

His narrowed yellow eyes bored through me. 

"Fine then. But just one game."

I sat down, relieved, and picked up the dice. 

"Just one game," I smiled. "For fun."

The thing about being the Devil for five thousand games of Universe? You learn how to lie. 

You also learn that there are. Always. Rules. For. The. Devil.
