They cheered and cheered even as I stumbled. Don - faithful Don, my friend even before the healing started - rushed to my side, knelt down on the red carpet and put his hand on my back.

"Elizabeth, what's wrong?" I could feel his eyes looking for some sign of trouble, or malady. He may have even seen the half inch cut on my knee, and dismissed it thinking it was nothing. Thinking it was just a small sliver of crimson.

I shook my head. "No, I'm fine Don. Really, I just... I just... the week has finally taken it's toll on me." I gave him my bravest grin. "Guess there's no magical cure for being worn out?" He wouldn't understand, but he didn't have to.

I met the gazes of dozens of people as we walked on. Meredith - she'd been my first guinea-pig, let me poke her with an eyebrow pencil a few times and then cure the light discoloration. The laughter at the realization, they'd stayed up all night talking about it.

Then there was the little Jefferson kid. He stood in front of his mother - was her name Helen? I couldn't remember anymore - He'd broken his arm in a daredevil stunt riding his bike down Sticky Gorge. He'd been in so much pain, bawling, unable to look at the bit of bone sticking out.

The faces all came to me as I passed them. Tamra who'd had just a wicked cough. Rufus who'd simply had the flu, but didn't want to cancel his wedding. George who... George who... who the doctor's had recommended he stop the treatment for his cancer, and just focus on making the best of the time he had left.

I looked down the long red carpet that ended at my home. It passed under a huge Welcome Home sign, clearly hand made by daughter. She stood under it, waving to me. I ran to her, the heels I wore left behind me on the carpet. I ran ignoring the tears sliding down my face. I ran and I lifted her and I hugged her close.

Make the best of the time you have left.
