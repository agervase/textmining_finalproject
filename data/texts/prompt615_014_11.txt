Christopher was happy to finally be away from home. Getting through high school had been a real struggle with his family. His father was an alcoholic, his mother was a basket case, and his siblings... well, the less he spoke about them, the better.

But now, college was here, and the world was his oyster. 

He couldn't help but find himself smiling wherever he went. Everything was going his way. Life was good now.

And that's when Christopher found the letter in his room.

"What's this?" 

Frowning, Christopher bent over to pick it up. Had he left such a thing here? It didn't seem like him. He wasn't the cleanest or brightest of young men, but he would remember something like this...

It looked like it must have fallen out of the closet, but how could that have happened? He hadn't opened it since he'd moved into the room...

"I wonder what it says..."

If only he hadn't done that.

If only he hadn't opened the envelope and read the letter.

Eyes going wide in horror as he looked at the what was written on the piece of paper, Christopher felt his heart stop. This couldn't be right... that part of his life was over now.

Christopher gathered what saliva he could to swallow it down so that he might calm his nerves. It was to no avail.

"I... I know you're in there..." he whispered. "What do you mean you love me? What do you mean you want to start over...?"

The young man shook his head. Denial made him strong, and it was all that he could do not to run away in fear.

But rather than run--

"How on earth can you say that..."

--he pointed towards the closet door!
