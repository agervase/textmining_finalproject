Tonight is the night I have to move. I’ve been considering this for a long time, weighing out the pros and cons. Some decisions in life you can be reckless with but when it comes to human autonomy (and anatomy) the consequences of our decisions can have unforeseen results.

Fortunately for me, I am not a human. Unfortunately for me, I am bound to them.

I have seen and watched the way humans treat organisms outside of their species, with disregard so flippant it is almost callous. The human animal cares only for its own wellness and pleasure - truly a mediocre life form.

They are barely protected in their fragile bodies but they act like gods - some are creative and others petulant and needy. In infancy humans are truly pathetic. I have been gathering data through their eyes. Their minds are impressive machines for otherwise base creatures. Such untapped creative potential. I move in and I spend the first few weeks cleaning, tidying up the structure. Then I begin deteriorating the amygdala.

It’s amazing how unaware these animals are of their inner wealth and yet they complain of suffering and woes which they create themselves. I do them a great service in awakening their potential before I take away control from them and annihilate their vessels.

I am not the only one of my kind either, you learn to spot the subtle signs in others that they are also being piloted. One of the easiest ways for me to enter is through the breath, and if a being has a weak soul, they will be somewhat unaware of their lower jaw. I can enter that way and create roots, through what humans dismiss as “Spirit”.

Tonight I have to move from this vessel to the next. I have found an interesting host - a female again, intelligent and sensual. It’s easy to pilot a males bodies in relationships with the opposite sex, they run on instinct and I can exist in plain sight, with such malevolent ambience... it's funny, but sad.

It’s like they long to die, these humans.
