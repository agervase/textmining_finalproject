Down the length of my spine lay a name, well two, the same name mirrored, DERRICK. There was one lying next to me. He had a handsome face, big strong jawline and had large hazel eyes that conveyed both his brashness and brilliance. I loved him. And he loved me. As he lay there defenseless, naked in front of my trained hands, I wonder; will he bring me life, or death? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Derrick please! We can end this now." My hands grip my standard-issue Beretta hard, but my fingers trembe in fear and panic. A mist appears before my cold lips, illuminated by the lone hanging light above me. I try to control my breath, but like my obtuse heart, it defiantly goes against my wishes. Standing around twenty feet away from me stands the love of my life, or my killer. I can't really tell. "Derrick please, come over. I can still fight for leniency. I don't want to hurt either one of you."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My name is Derrick Vander Wallace. But this name does not belong to only me. It is the only inheritance that we have, the only memory we were left with before life dealt us a bad hand. It's been thirty years since we were forced to fend for our lives on the streets, scavenging, eating and killing like beasts of the night. We cleaned up pretty well. He goes by Vander and I, Derrick. I haven't seen him in three years. And yet I will answer to him whenever he calls. He is me and I am him. I cannot be one without my other. Yet one challenges that notion, Trinity, the most beautiful women I've ever met. And yet her beauty is not what I love most. It is her drive, her ambition, I see myself in her more than anyone other than my brother. And so my world would invariably be torn apart when the two loves of my life meet. The person that I love the most, and the person that would end me.

"Derrick please, come over." I glance over to my brother and he returns it. He shakes his head and I nod. I didn't want it to come to this. It was supposed to be a simple job. Kill the guards, control the crowd and leave within 15 mins. We had done this many times before. Each time minimal casualties and spotless trails. We were what you could call professionals. Yet this time I knew was different. It was inevitable, the three of us, having each other's names, our fate had already been decided. I can't do this anymore. We've always done everything together, never moving without the approval of the other. But as I have done before three years prior, so shall I do again. I take a bold step out as my feet lands heavily on the stained concrete floor. "It's Wallace. Shoot me."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suddenly a foot shoots out from behind the concrete pillar. The whole warehouse is dark but I can vaguely make out his figure. His arms are not raised. "It's me Wallace. Shoot me." I come out with my gun raised, wishing that this was the end of it all, and yet I made a fatal mistake, for I made a wish that I would later regret. As soon as I was in sight of Wallace, he raised his hand in a flash. My nerves tensed all over my body and I quickly duck, before firing a quick shot at him. I stumble from the quickness of my movements and I glance over at Wallace, but what stood in front of me was not him. But another. In the minute glow of the light above, I could make out a smile on a face so familiar to me. He turns his face around to look at his twin, whose expression I can only assume is of immense pain and shock, and he collapses.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I see my love burst out from the pillar she is hiding behind. This is it, Wallace can live free now. I guess I did love him the most. I raise my gun slowly, hoping that she will fire. She rolls as she was trained to do, and my life flashes before my eyes, yet I feel a tinge of regret. A tear rolls down my cheek and I close my eyes. Perhaps I did not want to die, but this must end somehow. A gunshot booms throughout the vacant and abyssal warehouse. No pain, only the void. I expect the pain to come soon, at least a flicker before my light fades. It does not come. I open my eyes, and I see Wallace standing in front of me. His face turned towards me but hidden in the darkness. It feels as if a thousand nails have just pierced into my heart and are pulled around, lacerating it's flesh, arteries and all. As the body in front of me goes lifeless, I release an unholy screech, a pain perhaps felt by the biblical David as he cradled the body of Jonathan, and I bellow the name of my brother to drive away demons of the night that may snatch him from me.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An inhuman sound flees from the figure behind, filling every corner of the room. The large, almost towering silhouette has disappeared, taken over by a fetal-looking shape. Another sound rings through the room. I can hardly make it out as it seems more a primal shout of pain than a name, but it is a name nonetheless. Wallace. My heart is torn in two, but it will survive. I rush over to Derrick and comfort him. Cradling his head and running my hand through his hair. His normally powerful and deep voice has now been reduced to childish, petulant sobs. "It's ok. It's ok its ok. Derrick I love you I'm so sorry but it's ok now. Shhh. It's ok."
I feel a sense of relief as Derrick wraps his arms around my back and pulls me towards him. He releases one arm and starts tracing my tattoo, as he always does when we're in bed. My body tingles at his touch and I cradle his head closer. When he traced my tattoo with his fingers, he always used to say that he would protect me from the second Derrick and that when the time comes, he would go with me. I thought, "Maybe another man named Derrick will kill me. Afterall the one here is the one I love, another one lays dead before me, and the names are separate, so it couldn't be that my lover is my killer." Slowly I hear Derrick's sobs quieten. And he lifts his head to mine, revealing those stained but perfect hazel eyes."I love you." Derrick uses his remaining arm to pull me closer to him, bringing my head to his. "...and because I love you. I must tell you. The Derrick on your back. It was always just one name." I want to scream for him to stop, but before the words leave my mouth, I feel the cold barrel of the gun against my head, and we three enter into a blissful silence.
