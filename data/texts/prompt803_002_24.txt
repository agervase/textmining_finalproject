No robber would ever expect a bank employee to already have cleared out the vault. The robbers command everyone to get down on the floor. As I am sitting on the floor clutching my backpack to my chest I start scooting on my butt backwards as the bank robbers are occupied with the tellers and other customers. I just need to make it 20 ft to my office and desk where I can hide the backpack in my secret compartment that I built into my desk. One of the robbers looks over to me but after he notices my name tag he moves into the next customer. Worried that they will move onto the vault and realize it is empty I continue to move towards my desk wondering where the cops are since I had already set off my silent alarm that the robbers don't know I am wearing. 

It seems like time is going so slow when finally the cops pull into the parking lot. This buys me more time as the hostage negotiator distracts the leader of the gang away from the vault. The negotiations go on for awhile and finally the robbers agree to let one employee and one customer go as a sign of good faith to get a helicopter to make their escape in.

I help an elderly man with a cane out of the branch and the cops rush to get us to safety. I am able to cry and act scared at any time so as the emts are checking me out they are convinced I am in shock and transport me to the hospital. The ER is luckily very busy as I am left alone behind my curtain for awhile. I get up and walk away never to be seen or heard from again.


The beaches and snorkeling in Belize are amazing year round and 300,000 goes a long way down here.
