You live on a planet that's almost like Jupiter,  not the planet itself but a planet with more than 7 moons, all of varying sizes.

The trajectory and speed of these moons mean that for 23 hours and 56 minutes of each "Day" there is always at least 1, if not two moons in the sky at any Time.

This planet contains several sub species of Man, one a werewolf like species that live in their werewolf state for 23 hours and 56 minutes of each "day". There are other more normal humans, but these humans live as a lower class. Not expecting the same benefits or rights has their wolfkin brothers. (Brothers is used ironically, the humans non wolf are practically abused slaves in this world. 

There is technically 4 minutes of the day when all the wolves become like normal men,  people used to revolt and up rise during these crucial few minutes. But once that time was up it always ended the same. They were turn back into werewolves and kill anyone who dared defy them.

This went on for hundreds,  thousands of years. Culture and tradition dying as the wolf people continued to live in a frozen bubble in time,  never changing,  always doing the same. 


Until one day, a comet came, and knocked one of the moons right off its path. Only by a little.

But a little was all they needed.

The first day after the cosmic explosion in the sky occurred,  and everyone can't help by notice the wolf people didn't change back until 6 minutes after one moon went down, for another to come up.

No one Was sure what to make of this,  on both sides. It surely wasn't enough to catalyst a change.

Until the next day when the moon was gone for 12 minutes.
