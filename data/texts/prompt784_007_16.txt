a darkened bar, lit dimly by bioluminescent algae on the ceiling. the place is mostly empty, just two locals and the barman.

"have you heard anything about this new species?" one says
"leave it off man, you know i cant talk about my work."
"so thats a yes then?"
the sharply dressed alien sighs, "yes, yes i have heard of them, im meant to be helping out with the peace talks."

"whats a peace talk?" his mate asks.
"actually its this crazy concept they came up with cycles ago, basically theyre really fuckin good at war right? so if they didnt stop then theyd end up killing themselves. so after a while the leaders will sit down and negociate a deal where they stop killing each other in return for something."
the second alien took a sip of his beer (or equivalent thereof) before responding, "thats stupid, why doesnt one side just crush the other and win?"
"i already told you! theyre some of the best killers in the galaxy, apparently theyre a natural predator species with no natural weapons, theyre not even spikey! they only live like 10 cycles too."
"they dont sound very good to me. the Oderc are beasts, they can run really fast, theyre super strong, they have poisonous spines they can shoot out, youre not telling me these things are better? i mean, even we have claws."
"humans dont have any of that because they dont need it! theyre super fucken smart, unlike you-"
"hey!"

"they have all these crazy ideas about everything, like, crazy stuff about warping space to travel faster than light, or using black holes to make power!"
"see. told you they were idiots.who ever heard of warping space?"
"but thats the fucking point! theyre geniuses! 60 cycles ago they were living in mud huts, now they have inter-stellar travel!"
"liar! i thought you sraid they only lived for 10 cycles. you cant even get from here to wethea in thatr time."
"exactly! they built an entire fucking city in space and put rockets on it, now they can live in space full time, for generations."
"what, like the, um, that old myth-"
"the Tejahati?"
"the tejahati!"
"well obviously no. they dont breath starlight for one."

"so why do we need peace talks with them for anyway?"
"who knows? apparently theyre touchy, and very violent. they were under observation, apparently things got a little out of hand." 
"out of hand? how?"
"something to do with some guy dying that caused 3 global conflicts, theyre blaming the observer vessel for starting it."
"ugh, politics. boring."
"you realise thats my job, right? im a diplomatic envoy."
"i know, i know. i just wanted a little dirt, thats all", at that the other one snickers. "what, whats so funny?"
"thats probably what theyre worried about, us wanting dirt. thats what they call their planet see."
"what, dirt?"
"dirt, mud, something like that"


"have you seen one yet?"
"what a human?"
"yeah, what else?"
"nope, not a picture, not even a visual description. ive been trying to work out what they look like based on the character summary that was sent back. it says theyre very highly adaptable. like, they can make plans decades in advance but change plans on the fly, liek really quickly and easily. and theyve covered their entire planet. every inch of the place has hmans living there, in deserts, jungles, at the poles."
"sop theyre surface dwellers then?"
"primarily yeah, but they also live under water, and theyve had humans living in space for nearly two cycles now too. they have this concept called terraforming, basically its a thing they do to make places hapitable that shouldnt be. the council wants to get them to terraform a few planets in the central system in return for membership."
"you think theyre like slykas? gods i hope not"
"arent slykas the big balls of slime? somehow i doubt it. thatd bake them the first non-skeletal predators in the galaxy. plus slykas arent very clever."

at this point i swim over to refil their drinks, not that their drinks need refilling, the two had forgotten about them, caught up in the conversation.
"you two dont half talk, you know that? humans this and earth that." my voice is muffled by the helmet, but im using a translator anyway, so it doesnt matter.

the sharply dressed one goes red in the face, "that is classified information! what did you hear?"
"no more than i already knew" i say. 
"what do you know about them?" the other one asks me.
"a lot of lies and rumours probably, some people are convinced they have secret laser eyes."
"well clearly i know more about humans than either of you two, ive met more than a few of them too."
"liar, you cant have met them, theyre cycles away."
"thats what you think, trust me, im something of an expert." 
"prove it!"
"didnt you hear about our warp drives?"
