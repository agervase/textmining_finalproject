The giant doors swung open without even a hint of sound.  They were the only doors I'd ever opened that did that, no creaking or jangling or a subtle noise of paint peeling from the frame.  It was odd, considering they looked old enough that I could put my fist through one without a thought, but not a hint of rust quailed the hinges.

What laid beyond was a room both majestic and decrepit in the same breath; gold and silver and carved stone and wood, once polished to a mirror-shine but now coated in easily a decade's dust.  Arms and tools—weapons of glory and war—were strewn about the place, ornate and storied and in varying states of disarray.  I didn't need to see plaques or inscriptions to know what they were.  Longinus, Dansleif, Gae Bolg, Gram, Gungnir, Tyrfing, so many legends that I had to pinch myself just to make sure this wasn't some demented dream.

It wasn't.  And as my boots clicked softly against the flagstones, muffled by the age-old dust and grime, I felt a sense of... nostalgia, almost, but not quite.  Like there was something here which I'd forgotten so long ago, something that a part of me had unconsciously come to reclaim.

*Accept me.*

The hairs on the back of my neck sprang up, and I planted my feet, looking around quickly and putting my back towards a wall.

*Witness me.*

The voice... didn't come from a direction.  It seemed, rather, to reverberate through my own mind, to come from within me.

*Hearken.*

My eyes, wide-open and alert for an unknown threat, found themselves inexorably drawn to a barely-lit corner, to a pile of rags and moldy leather.  The faintest hint of rusted iron landed in the center of my gaze and despite my better judgement I was spellbound.

*Yes...*

"Who...?"

*I was given to many names in my lifetime... All of them stolen by others in this room, newer legends of greater import... I have been "Redeemer", "Unforgiven", "Answerer", "Godslayer", "Sword of Promised Victory"... But now I am nothing...*

I found myself standing before this gathering of refuse, my hand extended towards the hilt of this forgotten weapon.  Immediately I stopped, and recoiled.  How did I get from the other end of the hall to there?  Something wasn't right.

"What are you?"

*A weapon... fool... long unused and long bereft of legend... A forbidden blade to all but they in most dire need...*

"Mh..."

My hand once more extended towards the sword, this time of my own volition.  The grip was old, but not decaying; like a stone that had weathered a thousand storms, it was worn but strong for its trials.  Pulling it free from the refuse, for the first time in all my life I felt well and truly awake.  Like a limb had been restored to me that had laid so long unused I had forgotten its existence.

*Yes...  Wield me in the name of honor or vengeance... Our destiny awaits at the end of all roads...*

"Well, then..."  I twirled the blade in my hands, admiring the balance and weight that felt perfectly matched for me.  If it was a weapon of legacy, it needed some kind of name... "Falvern," I called it, "Let's go carve a legend out for you.  Once that will stick."

*...*  It felt as though it would smile if only it had a face.  *... Yes... Let us engrave our tale into the stone of history... partner.*
