My [27F] husband [31M] said he got all the spiders but has been acting weird.

Hey everyone, ok so disclaimer that I’ve loved my husband for a long time and everything as always been fine. We’re been married for 3 years and together for 10. 

I guess it started a month ago when we had a really bad spider infestation in our home. I mean, we don’t live in the nicest place but still, this was too much.  Anyways, he cleaned the house and he went to bed early for a headache or something. He claims he got all the spiders but sometimes I’ll see one run along the wall, but I figured that’s just nature in the summer.

Now my husband doesn’t speak to me?  He barely moves at all. It’s almost sad watching him try to eat, like he’s having a hard time getting the spoon to his mouth. Poor guy.

He also hasn’t showered in a while and is starting to stink. His eyes look a little sunken, and his skin is pale but he refused to go outside.

Also, on all of his clothes, I’m finding strands of what looks like really blonde/light colored hair? We don’t have a dog and we both have very dark hair. He doesn’t leave the house but I’m worried maybe someone comes over while I’m gone?? He says it’s nothing but...

Oh also something weird that I don’t know is relevant or not, but sometimes he walks around and I notice a huge shadow over him? Like I know it’s not just a spot in our ceiling because it moves with him. 

Has this happened to anyone else before? What do I do? Is he trying to hide something?

tldr: husband has been acting like a really stiff puppet lately, won’t tell me what’s wrong
