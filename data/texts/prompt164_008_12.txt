I coughed a little at all the dust that came up from my family’s treasure box. Inside we’re a great assortment of different items. There was a sword, a clear bag that seemed to hold something sparkly inside, and my dads old diary. 

Supposedly, it had started with my great great great grandfather. He had been a great pirate captain who fought battles with Indians and mermaids and fairies when the curse befell my family. 

A shiver ran through my body just thinking about living life on the ocean. 

I didn’t believe my father when he used to tell me the stories about my ancestors when I was a kid. My dad was a raging alcoholic who had been driven mad dealing with his many issues. He left when I was a kid. I didn’t understand it then but I sort of get it now. I sometimes see myself descending into that same darkness and have to catch myself before I spiral out of control. 

My family is what keeps me together now. My wife is the reason I’ve been able to keep it together all of these years. She had been patient with me when I told her we had to leave our homes and move to the middle of nowhere. She had stuck by me when the curse had left me broken. Today she had surprised me by telling me we were going to have a son. 

I grabbed the sword out of the box. I knew what I had to do. No longer would my family be hunted by the creatures of the sea. I, James Hook, would end the curse. I ran out of my house. I took a deep breath and one last look at the family I would never see again before jumping head first into the sharknado.
