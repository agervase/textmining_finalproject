Somewhere, on planet B13 of solar system number 137652, a man was staring blankly at a computer screen.

Well, he wasn't exactly a man, and it wasn't exactly a computer screen. In fact, he was a humanoid alien known as a Ziri, and the computer screen was an image-displaying device, specifically Device 15ZK51. Hardly the same thing at all, come to think of it.

But, for all intents and purposes, he was a man staring blankly at a computer screen, if only because of the familiar look of glassy horror that the humans used to be known for. This man was suffering the same thing that so many humans have suffered ever since the dawn of the Internet.

"...Afhir? Are you alright?"

The man didn't even look away from the computer screen as he responded to his wife's question. "I need cleansing."

The woman looked puzzled. "What on B13 for, Afhir?"

"I have just been exposed to an image that may cause me severe and irreversible mental harm. I must cleanse my mind at once."

"I'm sure it's not that bad."

"It is, Fidora. Believe me it is. I do not know what kind of sick pleasure humans used to take from sharing such disgusting images on this...*Internet*, but it is abominable. I need cleansing."

Fidora varked, a sound that expressed the Ziri equivalent of 'scorn'. "You're being silly, Afhir. Here, let me see--"

Afhir promptly pushed her away, preventing her from seeing the screen. "No."

"Afhir."

"I must shield you."

"You're being *ridiculous*."

"I am not."

"Yes you are. Let me see."

"No."

With another vark, Fidora shoved a protesting Afhir out of the way. Her eyes fell on the computer screen--

--And she froze, her gaze turning more and more distant as her mind fully absorbed the horrors of what she was seeing. All fell silent.

"...Fidora?"

Silence.

"Fidora?"

Silence.

"Fidora, are you alright?"

"...I need cleansing."
