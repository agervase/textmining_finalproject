10k ... Why 10k... Fudge if I know. But as Bruce lee said... Man who practised 10k kicks once and one kick 10k... You get the idea. 
I had nothing. No really. I was a beggar. The powers did not help. This was still in the early days you see. I was marked by the Govt. They prolly wanted to cut open my spleen or something. You wouldnt believe the things I did. Now I can walk through fire unharmed. Breath in the most noxious of fumes and remain conscious. Get peppered by 20mm shells and walk it off. 

I should know. That was just yesterday. 

Then I discovered something. Them. The ones who folded reality. However powerful i was... I was nothing compared to them. 
How... How.. how did they fold reality around themselves... 

I saved her. Yes I did. Almost did not manage it. Yet I did. For a while it was a close thing. Then i got hold of its throat. Super grip comes in real handy. 

10 thousand drinks. Yes that was the key. Absinthe.  How was a beggar like me going to get absinthe...  

I managed it somehow.  For a while,  I robbed people blind.  Never no body who could afford to loose a few bucks mind you. Every thing I earned went towards drink.  Absinthe.  

I had no trouble finding myself a willing seller. I had cleaned up you see.  Also..  10thousand minutes of staring at a mirror.  Yeah.  Basically you became those funny folks from Game of thrones.  The ones with the face change thingy.  

The final morning..  When I had downed the last millilitre of absinthe..  I became fully aware of them.  

One of them had been observing me the whole time.  The woman I saved.  She was..  Unnaturally  beautiful.  

Good.  I was getting tired of waiting.  

Waiting for what?  

You'll see.  She winked.
