John Wick barely made it out of Wayne Manor with his life. He had managed to stumble back to his 1969 Ford Mustang (of which, this is the third one he's had now) even with a broken ankle and his left arm dislocated.

Pure adrenaline was probably masking the pain and keeping him going. Somehow his Mustang was untouched and still in working order. He pulled himself onto the driver seat, cranked the ignition and the big block V8 roared to life. He hastily threw the car in drive and left 2 long black strips of rubber as he tried to put as much distance as he could between himself and Bruce Wayne.

As Wayne Manor shrank in his rear view mirror, John did a quick self-analysis of injuries. Besides the aforementioned broken ankle and dislocated left arm, he had 3 broken ribs, some minor internal bleeding from where Mr. Wayne had picked him up and threw him against the wall and John was also pretty certain that he had a mild concussion as well.

All in all, par for the course.

What John Wick was puzzled about, was how a billionaire playboy had so much hand-to-hand combat training, even more skilled and more capable than John himself had ever seen or had ever come across in his line of work. The way Bruce Wayne managed to somehow seem like he was everywhere all at once, and then instantly disappear back into the shadows without so much as a sound astounded him. Mr. Wayne's breathing was also incredibly controlled and deliberate, almost as if someone had taught him how to conserve his strength through meditation.

On his way out of escaping Wayne Manor, John had caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a hidden bookcase with the very tiniest sliver of light shining through the edges, but he dismissed it and chalked it up to an old drafty mansion.

"*Finally.*", John thought to himself as he pulled up to The Continental Hotel and breathed a quick sigh of relief. He knew he'd be safe here to recuperate and re-think his strategy of assassinating Bruce Wayne. As he walked up to the hotel’s front desk, the Hotel Manager welcomed him and remarked

"*Your room is ready Mr. Wick, nice to see you staying with us again.*”, the Hotel Manager paused as he gave John Wick a quick once over and continued, "*Will you be needing any further assistance or additional services?*".

"*Send the house doctor up to my room please.*", John responded.

"*Right away Mr. Wick.*" said the Hotel Manager as he picked up the phone at the same time.

John got to his room and breathed a sigh of relief as he fell onto the bed. Looking up at the ceiling, he slowly started drifting off to sleep.

The 3 knocks on his door jolted John out of his brief slumber as he instinctively reached for his gun by the nightstand, he realized it was probably just the house doctor. He slowly limped over to the door and let the doctor in. The doctor silently glided across the threshold and motioned for John to sit down on one of the chairs by the window. He started tending to John's wounds, clicking his tongue in disapproval every time he found a new wound or injury, but never saying anything more.

The doctor was almost done tending to John when suddenly all the power in The Continental Hotel went out.

Neither John nor the doctor were able to see more than 10 feet in front of them, it was pitch black. John looked out the window and saw that 10 city blocks around the hotel had also been plunged into darkness. Eventually John found his cell phone and turned on the flashlight. He bid the doctor farewell, but not before handing him a few gold coins.

John made his way back down to the front desk, down 12 flights of stairs and barely able to walk, John was laboring as soon as he got there.

Without prompting, the Hotel Manager spoke to John, "*My apologies Mr. Wick, we are not sure how the power is out, we have 3 redundant systems in place, but we are working on restoring power as soon as huma-*"

Suddenly the hairs on the back of John's neck stood up on end as the Hotel Manager's words hung in the air. Puzzled, John noticed the Hotel Manager looking past him... behind him. John had left all his weapons back in his room, save for a few blades hidden on his person. His right hand had started to reach into his inner breast pocket as he whipped around ready to fight, but as soon as he caught a glimpse of the imposing figure now standing behind him, he stopped.

The figure was dressed in a suit of all black custom molded armor, no doubt bullet and fireproof from the looks of it, with hardly any separation in his armor plates for a blade to fit in between. He even had a cape on. The figure was also wearing a mask... a cowl to be precise, with 2 pointy ears coming out the top. John squinted and could make out a vague shape of a bat on the figure's chest. John quickly realized, and muttered under his breath at his luck, because he now knew why Bruce Wayne was so hard to kill.

Bruce Wayne and the Batman were one and the same person.

"**YOU WERE SENT TO ASSASSINATE ME, WHO SENT YOU?!**" the figure’s deep and raspy voice boomed and echoed around the now empty hotel lobby.

John was taken aback, "*This hotel has a strict ‘no business’ policy*" he managed to blurt out, "*Which means all manner of combat, fighting or killing are prohibited while on these grounds.*" he continued.

Then something quite peculiar happened that John was not ready for. This imposing figure all dressed up like a bat started laughing. And not just a small, quick chuckle, his laughter bellowed throughout the empty hotel.

John was not amused, "*What is so funny?*", he asked.

But before the words were even done coming out of his mouth, the Hotel Manager cautiously responded...

"*Mr. Wick, while it is true that the hotel grounds has a ‘no business’ policy, we do have only* **ONE** *exception to that rule that almost nobody knows of. That exception states that only the founder of The Continental Hotel himself may be exempt from this policy.*", the Hotel Manager slowly raises a finger and gestures at the imposing figure standing behind John and says, “***Him***.”

Slowly, he excuses himself from the front desk and walks out the front door.

John is in disbelief. He turns around to confront this costumed vigilante only to find that he has once again disappeared. In his place, on the floor, is a business card.

John picks it up and examines it. It was a standard sized business card, embossed with the Batman's symbol in the middle and nothing more. Puzzled, John flips it over, and there he finds a note.

It read, "**Find me again**".
