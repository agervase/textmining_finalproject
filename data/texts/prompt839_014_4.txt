*I...no. That's not possible.*

"Oh...I'm sorry."

*You must've cheated, there's no possible way...*

I held my gaze towards my shoes. I don't even like chess. I offered to play Death in a rousing game of "How about we do literally anything else", but he doesn't seem like the kind for humor. "I mean, you can't cheat death. I've heard you can flirt with him, but you don't really seem like the kind of guy that dates."

*SILENCE. HOW DID YOU DO IT?*

"I just moved the pieces around randomly, hoping you'd win as quickly as possible. I really kind of want to get this over with as soon as possible."

*What are you playing at?*

"Look man, I didn't kill myself to sit around and play a game I don't even like with a sore loser. I won. I'm sorry." I couldn't see his face through the impossible shadow that hung beneath his hood, but I could feel his eyes burning into me. "So what happens now?"

*I... I don't know. You are the first mortal to have accomplished such a feat. I suppose I could give you a second chance at life, let you go and -*

"Yeah no, hard pass. I think you missed the part where I killed myself. Living blows."

*The rules dictate that if you lose you go to the afterlife, so the opposite of that must be sending you back for a second chance.*

"Right, so I have to go back because I won."

*That is what I think is best.*

"Oh fuck that, best two out of three."

Sharon checked on the patient. Miraculously he had been taken in with a BAC of nearly .3 and was somehow still kicking when he made it here. Crazier still, he was more less stable now that he had gotten the alcohol out of his system. She checked him over, making sure his IV bag was full and all the connections were still secure when she was startled by him moving. She looked down and he had his head pulled up off the pillow he was leaned against and was trying to survey the room through the tightest squints humanly possible. "Am I dead?"

"Sir, we're so happy you're awake, but you really should conserve your energy. Try and relax."

"Am I dead?" He repeated, turning his head to look in her general direction.

"No sir, you've made quite the recovery."

He plopped his head back down and let out a sigh. "I don't even fucking like chess."
