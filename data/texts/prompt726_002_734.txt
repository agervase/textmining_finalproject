Dear Diary,

My name is  Eightytooze. Well, my full name is 828282, I got kind of lucky to be born with such a great name. My friend, 828283, told me that they were always jealous. I like to call 828283, Eightytoozethree to make 828283 feel better. Sometimes, when that get's too long, just Eighttoozethree. 828283 says I am lucky, but I don't feel lucky.

Today we were assigned for homework by Ms. English to write about one Brave New World. I liked the book, it was fun to read. I wrote an essay about how I liked the character of Bernard. Bernard is a lot like me.  I wrote about he is the character who I relate to. 

Tomorrow, we are going to be assigned by Ms. Math algebra. I like Algebra, but Ms. Math says I am not as good at it as 894922, 894922 gets higher scores from Ms. Math.

Yesterday me and 828283 and me snuck outside.

We were suppose to be in class, so Mr. Gym could teach us sports. We don't like sports, so we snuck out.

We got caught. 894922 ratted us out. I am not sure that is true, but I am almost positive that it is.

828283 is suppose to be partners with 894922, but I don't like 894922. I'd rather be partners with 828283, 828283 isn't better than me at math. 828283 thinks I am lucky, even though I am not.

I'm gonna ask Ms. HomeEcon if I could switch next Wednesday. I have to ask 828283 about it. 828283 says they like 894922 well enough, but 894922 isn't as good at Math or English than me. 828283 is like Lenina with Henry Foster. Henry Foster isn't as good at math as me.

My partner is like Fifi bradlaugh.

828283 told me I was "pneumatic once" it was a reference to the book, because 828283 knows I like it.

One time, I woke up feeling like something was wrong, like I was suppose to have a mother, that I wasn't like Bernard and was like John, because I had a mother.

828283 snuck into my room, 828283 had heard me screaming, 828283 stayed in my bed even though we weren't suppose to.

828283 said I was lucky, but I only feel lucky when I am with 828283.

Love, 828282.
