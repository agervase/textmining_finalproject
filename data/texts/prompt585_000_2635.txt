"We were wrong. Planet inhabited. Do not send rescue."

These words silently flashed across the monitors of the stunned crew on Earth, their blinking the only sign of life in the still control room.

He was first to break the silence.

"Think they got it?" said Marc, turned away from me and staring distantly out the window, as if trying to spot the transmission floating through space.

I swung around in my swivel chair and lit up a cigarette, taking advantage of our newly habitable atmosphere. "I sure hope so."

The smell of the lit match reminded me of home. Only ten left. Of course, we weren't supposed to bring anything flammable, but I couldn't help but sneak them onboard. Had the mission failed, it certainly wouldn't have been due to a matchbook.

"You know, you really shouldn't smoke those."

I chuckled. "Why, cancer? We just took the biggest risk of our lives, I think I can afford a smoke."

"No," Marc said, "because we don't know anything about how the chemicals in cigs may react out here. Might surprise you, but no one smokes on Mars."

"No one *smoked* on Mars," I corrected him with a wink, turning back to the screen. "Looks like the message was received. Now here's hoping they listen. Wouldn't want anyone contaminating the place," I snickered.

"Should we feel bad?"

I quickly spun back around. "Why should we feel bad? We didn't lie. The planet is inhabited. By us."

"I know, and you're right, it's just... I can't help but feel like we're leaving them behind. All of them."

He was right. That's exactly what we were doing, and we knew full well when we started. It's not like I wanted it to be this way. I fought like hell back home. We both did.

I rose from my seat and joined him at the small, round window, standing close. "We are. But no more than they've abandoned themselves."

I gently turned Marc by the shoulder and led him over to the airlock lever, nodding a gesture to pull. Slowly, he reached down and opened the doors to our new world. The first two inhabitants of Mars, ready to begin humanity's new chapter.
