"Please stop it. You don't- " My screams are cut off as a piece of dirty cloth is stuffed into my mouth. The guards turn the other way whenever this happens. The prison hall is not crowded as most of the inmates curl up in their rooms to escape my cries. Sometimes a person throws up, even having witnessed my torture everyday. My eyes plead through tears, looking at an upside down blurry world, but the hands of my torturers do not falter. The ritual begins again ...


--------------------------------------------------------------

I had a name once. Long ago. I was an Egyptian robber. I don't know if I was the only one cursed. Or such people are out there, living day in and day out. Such is the curse. To wander always, never having someone close to you, destroying everything you built in your life. I led many lives. I have loved countless times and lost them every single time.


 You have no idea how mind numbing and soul crushing it is to always be alien to everyone. To have no real friends. To have every feeling cut out of you, ever so slowly, by time. Until there is only hate left in your heart- for everything, and yourself the most. I spent a good century just drifting- trying to kill myself, to starve, to just lie down like a rock, without any shelter. Until I was 'discovered' and 'trained' by a group of assassins, whose names got lost in the pages of history. I was used ruthlessly. But I couldn't care less for I had found my calling. The dying eyes of those men mirrored my own. A soul-brethren to me, however  fleeting the moment. I tried my best to prolong these moments with my brethren, always pushing my boundaries, inventing new ways to feel ever closer to them in their last moment of despair and horror.


--------------------------------------------------------------

I lay bloody on the ground in my cell, sweat gleaming from my forehead. My torn body gushing blood from a thousand places, my bones showing in places in others. My left hand is now only slightly twisted and bent. For the last three hours I have been putting my snapped arm bones back in place with my right hand. It will only take four five days for me to completely heal. So I do not have the privilege to a doctor. But my tormentors will be back tomorrow. Calming my heartbeat, I focus on setting my broken arm again. One thing at a time.

"Mortis, Angelus is found guilty of the cold-blooded brutal murder of sixty-five people. He is sentenced to life imprisonment for a hundred and twenty years without the possibility of parole."

-------------------------------------------------------------

I lay panting, my ordeal finally over. I look at the piece of bone in my hand, memorizing it, before throwing it away. Initially I was kept for 30 years in special cell, but when my 'specialty' became clear- I was transferred to gen pop.  On paper it was because I could not be killed but actually it was for the vindication of the public's sentiments. I was 'conditioned' by starvation and beatings before being let loose. I never stood a chance. I became the bitch of the Redemption gang (my scrapbook was in evidence but no one had considered it seriously at my trial . Except as an evidence of my mental instability. Disregarding the dates, the incidents were deemed too brutal and fanciful to be done by a person. They never understood my noble intentions. That was until 20 years ago when I 'came out of the closet'. The public grew furious upon this revelation, hence my present state). 

Over time a cult in my name grew. Unsurprisingly it was mainly the assassins guilds fighting over me. This last year, I got in touch with a very high profile group. I will be freed by the end of this month. They will probably never let me go, considering what I imagine to be very high costs involved in rescuing me. But that's all right- as long as I attend my calling. But before that I will  make each and everyone of my tormentors my soul-brethren. I will take the people closest to them and then inflict the same pain upon them as inflicted upon me and when these people will beg for their death, I will be their reaper and I will store in my mind their last moments  on the face of this earth, the cool feel of their last breath on my hands, their slowly glazing eyes gazing helplessly with fear in my eyes ... and finding a brethren there. I close my undamaged right eye as I recall the list of my tormentors.
