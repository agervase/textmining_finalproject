Human emotion is so sticky.

It is a toxin that infects your skin and the air you breathe, it is a crash and a crescendo, it is icy moonlight and slick tears and crooning violins.

Stars, it's unbearable. Every time I left the shelter of my office the sight of their weak, pale bodies huddled together in work would jolt me like a slap in the face. For even in the pure silence their emotions are a deafening cacophony, the symphony of a thousand discordant instruments clashing together. I've tried to protect myself with thick outerwear, masks and goggles, but  the force of their feeling has seeped in anyway, infecting my mind and poisoning my spirit.

They told me never to hire humans; I should have listened. I have caught mortality, and it is fatal.

Weeks ago, I watched the purple radiance of a dying star flare across the inky universe and I felt wonder, awe, something which thawed the inside of my icy soul. That day I spotted the first wrinkle to ever mar my smooth skin.

My sickness only got worse. A bubbly smile from a human child warmed my chest and I waved back to its cheerful greeting- to watch seized by terror as my hair shriveled into tarnished silver.

A thousand tiny emotions have played me since, like the fluttering keys of a piano. Now I am grey and old and wrinkled and gnarled and weak and look every year of my 526; But worse- I am *happy* to be so flush with feeling. I know it is my sickness speaking, but it is a relief to no longer feel an untouchable, cold hollow where my heart is supposed to beat.

I guess that is warning enough, isn't it, undeniable proof of my mental degeneration?

When they tell you to never hire humans, I beg you - 

Listen.
