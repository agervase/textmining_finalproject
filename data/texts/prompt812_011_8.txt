It was a cloudless dusk on the endless prairie. In the sky, the gods' buffalo were beginning their nightly trek, their gentle glow growing stronger as the sky darkened, their herd stretching from horizon to horizon. The Moon was a great bow, casting only a dim light onto the gently waiving grass. 

A clutch of teepees glowed against the darkness, forming a wide circle around a few dozen horses tied to stakes in the center. A few men with bows sat around the perimeter, their backs to the light of the fires. From the biggest teepee, a thunderous moan broke the silence of night.

"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh." It was beginning.

Inside the big tent, a fire roared. Its smoke spiraled up through the opening in top of the hide cone that was home to the Chief and his family wherever they made camp. 

"OHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhh."

A woman knelt on a pile of blankets, leaning forward on her hands and rocking her hips. Around her, her aunts and sisters and cousins swirled, warming water over the flames and keeping a cycle of hot water skins on the woman's back.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh."

As the woman's contraction ended, she rose to her feet. Her youngest cousin offered her a skin of water, but the woman strode past her to the tent flap. Her oldest aunt blocked her past.

"You're naked, Chieftess." 

"He is coming."

"Yes, and you should have him *inside* your tent."

"That is not of whom I speak."

The woman elbowed past her aunt, shoved through the flap, and strode into the night. As she walked through the camp, the few men outside their tents averted their eyes from her nakedness. Word quickly reached the chief, who came running to his wife.

"Why are you outside, mother of my child? You should be in the tent with your sisters."

"He is coming," she said, pointing towards the darkening eastern horizon, "do you not see him?"

"See whom?" The Chief scanned the horizon, but saw no-one.

"How can you miss him? He shines gold like the morning sun. His wings stretch wider than a lake. His breath is a fire bluer than the summer sky. Can you not see him?"

"My love, you are not well." The Chief grasped his wife gently by the shoulders and sought to turn her back to the tent. She wrenched away from him and jogged a few yards into the night before falling to her knees.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhh." The woman's moan had turned to a scream. Her aunts and cousins and sisters came running with skins, which they spread on the grass next to her. The woman rolled over onto the blankets of hide and rose to her hands and knees.

"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh."

The oldest aunt felt between the woman's thighs.

"He is coming. You must push now," she said.

"ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhh."

The woman squatted. Her aunt reached to catch the baby, but the woman swatted her hand away.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHH."

A boy emerged into the world, falling from his mother's womb and into her hands. The woman scooped him into her arms, brought him to her breast, and stood, crying. The boy joined his cry with hers. She looked up into the dark sky and strode forward, her tribe watching in bewilderment. 

The woman held up her son to the night sky. A minute or two passed, silence broken only by her sobs and the cries of the child. When she turned, the cord between her and the child was cut. A fire sprung from the grass just a few yards behind her, a firm wind from the West rising to blow it away from the camp.

"Behold," she said, "He who is Baptized in Dragon's Fire! The King of All the Plains!"
