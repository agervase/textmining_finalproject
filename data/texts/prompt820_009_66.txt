Alabaster doors, unfathomably tall and unimaginably wide, shifted silently open beneath the gentle brush of Catarin's fingertips. Glancing once more behind her, she stepped into the Temple of Ages, the stone slabs swinging shut behind her.

*The Temple of Ages - an homage to the Old Gods, divine beings that granted Their chosen warriors powers beyond any mere mortal. Countless wars were fought in Their name, and countless people died to sate Their bloodlust.*

Catarin couldn't help but stare in awe at what stood before her. A grand hall of white marble stretched out before her, seemingly unending. Jewels and gems, silver and gold and platinum lie unmolested in ornate filigree. Crystal chandeliers hang suspended from nothing, flickering light fracturing and scattering into the darkened corners of the corridor. *Surely this hall couldn't fit in the Temple,* thought Catarin, *for the plateau upon which it stands is barely large enough to support the Temple itself. This hall should have broken off from the building and fallen into the Abyss.*

*None truly knows from whence it came. Some time after the Fall of the Ieryssi Empire, scholars believe, the Old Gods placed the Temple of Ages upon what was then called the Abyssal Spire. A singular column of volcanic rock juts out from the bottomless Abyss, and at its top sits the Temple.*

Reminding herself of her purpose here, Catarin strode forth into the impossibly long hall. Beautiful tapestries lined the walls, depicting ancient battles and long-passed conquests. Beneath each saga, the artifact of legend stood, seeming to wait for its next champion. Catarin walked briskly past each weapon, never giving any more than a passing glance.

*Excalibur, the legendary sword that Artur used to fell the armies of Myrdr. Mjolnir, the holy warhammer that Thor Odinsson wielded in his conquest of the North. The Horn of Yeshua, which razed the walls of Ierysalm itself long ago. Many have flocked to the Temple of Ages hoping to find their glory.*

Catarin stepped lightly, trying her best to not disturb the dead as she moved steadily toward her charge. Bones littered the beautiful marble floor, the bleached skeletons of would-be warriors and desperate fools. Catarin knew better than to reach for one of the Old Gods' gifts. *Pitiful,* she thought, *thinking Them anything other than fickle.*

*There is only one way to reach the Temple of Ages, and that is via the bridge. The Temple stands in the middle of a bottomless chasm, an ancient volcano that has long been dormant. The bridge is no easy task to maneuver, though. It is as old as the Temple itself, and has long been rotted and frayed.*

All the weapons were shining examples of ornate design, extravagant beauty and breathless wonder. All but one. Catarin stood before the altar, winded and feeling older than she began. Calloused hands lowered the cloth wraps from her face, and golden locks fell in waves as she gazed toward the image above her.

*It is the First, and it will be the Last. You are the only one who can rightfully take it up, Catarin. It's up to you to save us.*

It was a crudely drawn picture. Two figures in shades of sanguine reds and earthen browns, standing in resolution. Two figures, strengthened in their fraternity. Two figures, standing in opposition.

One figure, standing above the broken body of his brother.

*Only you can save them,* the First whispered to her, *and I can give you the power to do it.*

...

Catarin Ierys, Empress of Ruins, stared toward the Temple of Ages with a righteous fury. Its blackened facade seemed to laugh at her from atop the Spire, a cacophony of mockery that crawled beneath her skin. With a disgusted sneer, she took hold of the weapon she had traveled so far to obtain and hacked away at the moorings of the bridge. The sharpened rock sawed through the ropes with minimal effort, and within moments the rickety bridge was falling. She watched with satisfaction as it sank into the darkened depths of the Abyss.

And Catarin turned and began the long journey home to kill her sister.
