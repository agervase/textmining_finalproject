Alfred serves Bruce his dinner, a succulent medium-rare steak expertly prepared.

"Thank you Alfred," says Bruce.

"Will there be anything else, sir?" asks Alfred.

"Warm the car up. I think I may have tracked down the penguin," says Bruce.

"Of course, sir." answers Alfred.

*A penguin?* thinks Wick. *Why would Bruce be looking to buy a penguin at this hour? These billionaires...*

Wick trains his sniper rifle onto Bruce's head. It's an easy shot. Right through the skylight and into the back of the head. Wick carefully cocks the rifle, takes a deep breath, and shoots.

The bullet hits the glass and ricochets off.

*Bulletproof glass?* thinks Wick. *What is going on here?*

Bruce looks up. An alarm has gone off. Skylight. He looks up through it. There is no one there. The sniper is fast, but obviously didn't do his research.

He sighs. The steak will have to go to the dog. Hopefully Alfred already warmed up the car. He stands up and heads to the cave.

Wick carefully tracks Bruce as he heads through the house. He enters the library then... disappears.

*Where did he go?* thinks Wick. *Better take a closer look.*

He carefully sidles up to the library window. There's some kind of device attached to the top of it. An alarm of some sort. The glass is also bulletproof.

*Odd. This Bruce sure is paranoid,* thinks Wick, *And rightfully so.*

He carefully detaches the alarm, jimmies the window open and sneaks inside. There is no one there. He looks around. One of the books appears more worn than the others. Wick tugs on it. A hidden door opens on the far wall.

*Interesting* thinks Wick.

He heads to the hidden passage, down a long flight of stairs.

Suddenly a loud booming voice fills the air.

WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

*Shit.*

Wick runs back up the stairs, hoping to escape. The hidden door is locked. He tries to put his foot through it but it's too strong.

DID SOMEONE HIRE YOU? WHAT IS HIS NAME?

*Cameras. There must be cameras* thinks Wick. He looks around. It's pitch dark, but he makes out a few shimmers in the distance. He takes out his pistol and shoots. The cameras shut down.

THOSE WERE EXPENSIVE.

"Yeah, well, so's your contract." yells Wick.

"There's a contract on Master Bruce's head?" asks Alfred.

The hidden door has opened. Alfred stands on the other side with a steak in hand. Wick points his pistol at him.

"Bruce will meet you in the study. Please follow me."

Alfred heads off. Wick hesitates, then follows.

"Study is the opposite direction," Wick points out.

"Yes, I know." says Alfred. "I have to feed the dog first."

He takes Wick to the kennel and feeds Ace. Then they head to the study. Bruce is inside waiting for them.

"Have a seat." says Bruce.

Wick sits. He continues to hold the pistol.

"Alfred will take your gun." says Bruce.

Wick hands his gun to Alfred. Alfred exits the room.

"So. What's your name?" asks Bruce.

"Wick. John Wick. And you. You're the Batman." says Wick.

"You're very astute." says Bruce.

"I recognized your dog." says Wick.

"You like dogs?" asks Bruce.

"I guess so." answers Wick.

"Ace just had puppies." says Bruce. "How would you like one?"

"In exchange?" asks Wick.

"Don't tell anyone." says Bruce.

Wick thinks for a second.

"Well. I do like dogs..." says Wick. "But not that much."

He pulls out a gun from his ankle holster and shoots. Bruce catches it with his teeth and spits it out.

"What the hell?" says Wick. "Batman can't do that!"

The Green Martian morphs back into his normal form.

"Sorry," he says. "Bruce is out of town at the moment. He asked me to fill in for him. Now, our deal?"

"... Fine. I won't tell anyone."

"Good. I believe you." says the Green Martian. "Take a puppy on the way out. I know you like them."
