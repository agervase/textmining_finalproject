I've never killed anything before. 

This was the first time. 

For whatever reason it felt like riding a roller coaster for the first time, the way there was a feeling that sat at the bottom of your stomach for the rest of the day. As for the rest of the day, I drove around with a pickup tuck that looked like it destroyed a deer. It was not satisfying. 

About an hour or so later I noticed the birthmark that I had on my arm changed slightly. The strangest part about the birthmark was that it looked more like a tattoo with definite lines that scripted "XP" with a bar that was never filled. This time around that bar was slightly filled. Then I felt a bump on the road and it changed again. 

It's a strange thing, I thought, what sleep deprivation and a sudden rush of adrenaline can do. 

There was another bump, and it filled again.

By this time the bar was one fourth of the way filled. I had no way of knowing why it was filling up or if this was just my imagination. Then I heard it. A "Loook ouoooiut" then a two thuds on the hood of my truck. I saw the two motionless bodies on the street, one female one male. Around us began to form a crowd, the crowd coming from the houses that lined the street. I got out of the truck looking over the bodies, then at my arm. It hadn't filled. 

Then I looked over at them again, their eyes barely open. One of them mouthed the words "I love you" then the other "I love you, too." There eyes closed.

In my head I heard a demented voice.

A voice that still trickles in my dreams as I attempt to forget though sleeping. 

Almost a rewarding voice, but far from it. 

"Triple Kill"
