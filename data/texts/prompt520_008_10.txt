All I knew was that whoever got my body was in for a heck of an adjustment. I blinked up at the sky, I had almost forgotten about how blue the sky was.

I had been blind since I was eight, but now, in this strangers body I could see.

According to his drivers license, I was in Sven Michael’s body. And I was in Germany.

That might explain why so many of the street signs had stuff I couldn’t read on it. It wasn’t that I had forgotten my alphabet, so much that the alphabet I see around me wasn’t mine in the first place.

The shock of the switch seems to be ebbing into possible hysteria, as people start rooting through the possessions of the bodies they now inhabited. 

Trying to find cellphones for the most part. 

Trying to find *help*.

A business type woman in her mid forties was doing her best to calm the crowd, with only mild success, “Remain calm, panicking isn’t going to help anything.” She cringed at her own voice, “I know I don’t look it, but I’m the secretary of defense for Australia, Robert Calloway, I’m sure that whatever this is can be reversed.”

A burly man wearing a construction uniform cried, “I want my mommy!” In a heart wrenching plea he wailed, “Please this is scary!”

I walked up an comforted him the best I could. “Hey, easy there. I’m Alex Toby, and I know I don’t look it, but I’m only 13. Who are you?”

The man sniffed, “My name’s Nathan, I’m 5.” His eyes were brimming with tears, “I just wanna go home.”

*’shit’* I thought, the implications of what just happened finally hitting me. *’wrong ages, wrong gender, wrong places...’* I thought again about how whatever poor sap got transported into my body was probably having to contend with my blindness, on top of the rest of the confusion.

I rubbed at my own eyes, still adjusting to the brightness of the noonday sun. I’d forgotten what that had looked like too.

“I understand Nathan, trust me. We all want to go home.”
