In-session chronological nomenclature: 12017.4326

In this session we observe how the colony is blindly exhausting its resources even at the expense of operational stability in its infrastructure. Furthermore what resources remain become ever more concentrated as the cycles tick onward. Other sessions have shown a precipitous shift in mass-cognition toward a change of behavior by this point, but various anomalies have led this particular session through a number of dramatic deviations from projected behavior!

For instance, The set of cycles labeled as 12016 catalog the colony's astonishingly overblown reactions to several decommissioned unit memory dumps. One of the notable memory dumps was not even of the same species and somehow provoked a cognitive contagion pattern bizarrely involving the ceremonial display of a unit's genitals as a gesture of 'respect'. 

Furthermore the resultant fatigue and thus impairment of the entire colony's risk/reward analysis systems created a vulnerability that, amazingly, resulted in the most prominent herd nominating a  **drastically** defective unit as its leader. Our conjecture thus far is that the defective unit in question was able to exploit the vulnerability by feigning competence - benefiting from advantageous resources and positioning from its progenitors while also, at the same time, actually attempting to obfuscate how much of its prosperity was based on *luck alone*.

The fallout of the primary herd's destabilizing behaviors tantalizes at a possibility for many intriguing and harrowing instances of strife among most of the other herds. We project further fracturing of the colony's herds very shortly. 

It is advised that frequent backups of this session be made in coming cycles so that we may observe further deviations. Of note, as of the session's most recent snapshot, there is a speculative premise actively being proposed by a unit that approaches an accurate portrayal of reality **outside** of the session. 

Enjoy, and remember to suspend progression frequently unless your session has been chosen for incubation. No sessions can be permitted beyond the 12050.3887 singularity event without authorization by consensus.
