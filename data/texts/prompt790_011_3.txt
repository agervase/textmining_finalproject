The stale air was practically choking to breath in, constantly day in and day out. Unsure whether I am below or above ground, those \*savages\* knew how to make me lose any sense of reality. The beatings, the torture, all became routine for me, unsure if I had been here for days, months, or years. I knew what they wanted, and I will not give it, but honestly, when will it end?

&#x200B;

My body grows weary of everything new they tried, I am sure i have died at least six times. Yet each time they did not give up and revived me. I remember the first time they had drowned me, my mind drifting from consciousness and then almost instantly being pulled from that. However, strangely I had caught something out of the corner of my eye.

&#x200B;

In those shadows of the room I thought I noticed the silhouette of a man, standing at the edge of the darkness. Was I going mad? Or had the oxygen cut from my brain from the recent water boarding? Then I watched as it had step closer from shadow to reveal a pale man in his later years, garbed in a nice, but dated suit.

&#x200B;

For a moment I could have sworn I had seen a skull instead.

&#x200B;

"People never cease to amaze me at what they will do for a trickle of information.' The pale man said with sorrow wrapped into his words.

&#x200B;

I just stared, perplexed at this new person, only different one I had seen since I arrived here.

&#x200B;

"Sorry you must be confused, usually I don't reveal myself till the time is right, but honestly this is getting ridiculous." A smile had crept on the pale man's lips, as he began walking over to me.

  
Was he here to taunt me? Just remember your training!

&#x200B;

"James Reed, Lieutenant" A bit of blood coughed out of my mouth.  "Serial Number: 84432162."

&#x200B;

The pale man looked a bit annoyed, then spoke in a calm voice. "I know who you are Lt. Reed, honestly I grow tired of being pulled here and witnessing your torment." He had walked closer, almost near at this point, but oddly I felt no breath as he came close.

&#x200B;

"Seriously Lt. Reed, what I have bore witness to the cruelty displayed onto you would make the Devil glance twice." He spoke with held contempt, and his hand reached for something behind him. "And I personally know him, so do us both a favor and live to see another day." From behind, he pulled out a scythe. I close my eyes in fear as to what he might do, if this was some new form of torture conjured by those mad men. Instead I heard the clanking of metal on the floor.

&#x200B;

I looked at the figure before, and the light shaking a bit from the force of his swing, and I could truly see who he was, for I saw the visage of a skull as the light escaped his face. With a grin the man turned around and slowly walked towards the door. 

&#x200B;

"Now I am going to do you a favor, normally I don't do this sort of thing, but I decide who lives and dies, and honestly I grow tired of these fools. They make my job and unnecessary pain bringing others like you to the brink of death every day."

&#x200B;

As he was opening the door, I just stared in fear, but with an odd sensation of respect for him. "Now Lt. Reed, do make your way out of here and northward, I don't want to see you for another few decades."

&#x200B;

With that he exited through, and I could start hearing gunshots and yells almost as soon as he left. It took me a minute to get used to walking again, but I eventually made it out through a carnage I wish not to describe.
