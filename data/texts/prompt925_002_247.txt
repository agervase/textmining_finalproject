"You fools," Asmund grumbled, pushing aside his fellow vikings, all of whom had stopped rowing and were intensely focused on the beautiful, fish-tailed women who called out a haunting, irresistible song. Well, irresistible to most; Asmund cared not for women of any kind, and only looked with disdain upon the dripping, naked things sprawled out on a flat rock precipice, one of many that lay directly in front of their ship. They would crash and drown, and then the sirens would...well, no one knew what it is they actually desired. Did they steal treasure? Or did they consume human flesh?

Asmund shuddered and made his way onto the upper deck, where the Captain and Helmsman stood, mouth agape and eyes slightly glazed over as they watched the sirens heave their heavy bosoms, singing their enticing melody. "For shame, brothers," he remarked. He gripped the steering wheel and gave it a rough turn, and the long-ship followed suit. Though the men were no longer rowing, the sails were at full-mast; the strong wind would carry them away from a watery grave. He looked over to the sirens, who glared at him and sang only more ferociously. Smirking, he turned away, eager to get back on course and away from this wretched place.

Suddenly, his ears perked up. A new melody had joined the throng, and this one...was different. It was not high-pitched and screechy; rather, it was low, steady and dripped like honey. Asmund licked his lips and peeked over the rocks again.

Another siren had appeared, but this one was entirely different: it looked like a male. A tanned, well-toned, muscular man, whose blond hair flowed freely with the wind, and whose voice had a lilt that made Asmund's knees tremble. He was so beautiful; Asmund had no idea such creatures existed on this blessed planet! He felt his heart pull toward the fish-man, and his mind blanked, only to fill with a longing and lust he had never felt before.

And that is why Asmund felt no horror as his hands turned the ship back toward the rocks.
