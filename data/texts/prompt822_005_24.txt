"*Excuse* me?" I spat, incredulous,

"**YOU** ***KILLED*** **HIM.**" rang the accusation again, seemingly sucking all the air out of the room. Geez, was there a hull breach?

I pensively withdrew my AR spectacles from my nose and pointedly clapped shut my notes, striding around from behind the podium to approach the High Seat. It wasn't until that moment that I recognized that what I was feeling was *rage*.

"Just **who** do you think you're referring to...? 'We'?" I interjected a pregnant pause, casting a disgusted glare around the room - at all the gazes in their myriad forms doubtless glaring back. "Us? Do you mean our 'species'? Do you mean our 'Government'? Do you mean perchance our 'Civilization'? Well if those are your criteria then I have some rather *inconvenient news* for you, o assembled cardinals of the Celestial Order: When you dropped your messiah on the world my kin call our home, there was hardly even a *type zero* civilization that had just *barely* begun to grasp the concept of Agriculture. He landed in a conflict territory where multiple factions of savages were operating **intentionally** on a lexicon of anger and hate, and *none of them* historically appreciated someone undermining their brutality. What did you *think* ignorant, violent bigots would do? What you're failing to realize is: this is why they're *extinct* now. The Terran Federation's populace hasn't been genetically compatible with the proto-humans of that era for **thousands** of years. The government that conducted this unspeakable brutality atrophied and crumbled to *dust* a mere few hundred years thereafter - a BLINK, I remind you! - So let me put this into terms you understand..." 

I composed myself, drawing up my posture and quieting my voice, though it still seethed "We didn't fail your messiah. Our predecessors did, and then immediately proceeded in a long, agonizing descent to destroy themselves. Need I remind you that **we,** on the other hand, have had to come as far as we did *without* your messiah."

I paced back toward the podium and collected my materials, my tone drifting conversational now. "We have survived this long fumbling **blind** in this universe, unraveling its functions and properties by sheer observation alone. If you insist on mistaking **us** for those foul heretics upon whose accursed bones we have painstakingly built *everything we have, ALONE,* ***without*** your aid or guidance," I made a point of re-equipping my smart glasses, before gravely delivering my closing. "Then I suppose we'll happily **stay** that way. You can continue arguing against our dead ancestors in our absence if you wish, but **our** part of this conversation is over."

And then I took my sweet time strolling out. I half expected them to stop me, but given the arrogance and self-entitlement endemic to the profession of 'literally representing God'... well, let's just say that I had faith my species wasn't important enough to be worth their trouble. At least my faith in *that* was well-placed.
