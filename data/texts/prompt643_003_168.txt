**Warning: Gruesome.**

I remember the sound of the gavel striking, a thud so loud that I felt it in my teeth and bones. I remember hands pulling me and guards herding me and a ride to the prison in a dark van. I remember the stiff jumpsuit, the thin mattress, and the scratchy sheets beneath me as I tried to sleep away the nightmare. What I don't remember is my crime.

&#x200B;

Not even the ghosts of my memories reveal any truth, and trying to access the memory is like peering through a frosted membrane. Noises are muffled, colors are muted, and shapes indistinguishable. And on the edges of that memory, a frightening darkness roils like clouds.  What did I do? What did I *do*? And what will happen to the life I left behind, the one I spent 30 years making?

&#x200B;

Every struggle, every achievement, every tear and smile and milestone...it's all meaningless in the face of this captivity. *Life in prison*, the judge had said. Life. That thought is enough to jolt me from my stunned, confused stupor and I find myself shredding what things I can get my nails on. And then the jumpsuit is torn and dirty, the mattress is flipped to the other side of the room, and the sheets are ribbons on the floor.

&#x200B;

I'm just supposed to accept that I deserve this? I'm supposed to trust, without thought or memory, that I've done something worthy of this punishment? No. I begin to grow suspicious. There must be some mistake, some conspiracy. I would've never done anything to jeopardize my idyllic life. I was a young mother, a devoted wife, a *kindergarten teacher* for Christ's sake. The guards watch me with wary, hateful eyes. But even still, I begin planning my escape.

&#x200B;

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

&#x200B;

Shivering and dirty I stand in our backyard, clutching my arm - I think it might be broken from a tumble over the prison walls. The house is dark. It's well past eleven, and only moonlight shows the way to the back door. The handle is locked, but I quickly smash the small window pane with a rock from the garden and reach inside with my good arm to fumble with the latch. Broken glass snags my skin and soon blood wells and mixes with the dirt and sweat. I wipe it against my ruined jumpsuit, and push my way inside.

&#x200B;

That first moment back, the familiar smell of home, the clock softly ticking above the kitchen table...it brings a peace I haven't felt since I was locked away three months ago. I feel the fog lifting, the membrane clearing, and a slightly unsettling awareness creeping up inside me. I pad barefooted through the kitchen and the dining room, making my way to the staircase with all our hanging family photos. The photos draw my eye and I pause, mesmerized. I run my fingertip over the glass, streaking through a thin layer of dust.

&#x200B;

This. This was why I had to get back. My life. A little girl in overalls, her long braid swinging behind her as she runs in Central Park, where we vacationed in 2006. She lost her first tooth on that trip, and cried and cried until we revealed the promise of a dollar under her pillow. A tall, handsome forty-something with a salt and pepper beard, chasing her. Older than me and more experienced and oh so charismatic. Being his young wife, his second after a bitter divorce from the first, was my secret point of pride. Thinking of them living without me these last few months, and in the time before, during the trial, makes worry bloom in my gut. Are they okay? Is my daughter a mess without her mom? Is my husband distraught at the loss of yet another wife?

&#x200B;

I climb the stairs more urgently now, eager and **feverish** to see them. I run to the room at the end of the hall, ready to wrench it open and throw myself into my husband's arms, dirt and all. But I pause, hand outstretched for the knob. There, pricking my awareness again is that darkness. A hushed warning, a malicious secret, another godforsaken moment of not knowing. It's enough to rock me back on my heels, as pain splits down my neck into my fingertips.

&#x200B;

And suddenly, I remember. I remember the sound of the hammer striking, a thud so loud I feel it in my teeth and bones. I remember hands fighting me and eyes pleading me and a ride to an unmarked grave in a dark van. I remember crawling back onto our stiff, bloodstained sheets ready to soak them anew with the tears of betrayal and thoughts of his affair. And then, a voice at the doorway...

&#x200B;

"Mama?" I remember slowly lifting myself up, bone and brain and matter beneath my hands and approaching the child - *our* child - whose father was cooling and stiffening beneath the earth.

&#x200B;

"It's okay. Let's get you back to bed," I had said. When she turned around and headed into the hallway, no small amount of hesitation in her steps, I grabbed the hammer from its place on the floor and followed. All this - all her smiles, all her tears, all her milestones we'd celebrated...it all came down to nothing. The hammer struck with a wet thump, and a high-pitched, breathy whine left her as she crumbled to the floor.

Trembling now in the hallway of our empty home, I realize that not knowing was a kindness.
