"Stephen" I said becoming the young man closer. He looked on in shock. He held a hand to his chest, covering the white star surrounded by navy blue on his ceremonial robes.  

"Me, Sarge?" He asked. I nodded. He left his podium and ran to me. He bent a knee to me. I was thrilled by his loyalty. 

"Stephen. Have you heard about the heresies going on in the Eastern Chapters" I asked him. 

He slowly nodded, Looking very nervous. He tried to find the courage to speak. It took him awhile but then he finally spoke.

"Heretics?" He asked. 

"Do you agree with their crusade on the Order of Steel and it's genocide on Yonkerin People?" I asked, waiting for a response. He gulped and slowly looked down and whispered one little word. 

"Yes"

I was shocked by Stephen. He was always a pacifist. He couldn't raise a fist to even the worst blasphemer. How could he agree with them?

"Stephen. Commander Karles is a heretic. He is a disgrace to Cap" I said. "Don't let his Nazi lies steer you away from the faith". 

"Karles is a defender of Justice, Democracy and the American Way" he said. 

I shook my head in pity. Stephen was so naive. He was only in the faith for three years. He had so much more to learn about Captain and his ways. 

I picked up Cap's shield from my throne. And showed it to him. He was in awe of it. He tried to touch it, but kept pulling away. 

"When you take on the identity of the Cap, you must follow him by example. He didn't kill civilians, even those of the demon lord Hitler. He believed that all can find his Mother Lady Liberty" I told him, as he held the shield in his hand. 

"Sarge. Why then, do we hate the Order?" He asked me, cheeks blushed in shame. 

"It all started in the epic called "CavalWur" I said.

"Cap and Iran disagreed about how to interact with the world. Cap believes he must only come to defend democracy when needed. Iran saw that man kind will need constant guidance and that they should become among men forever" I said.
