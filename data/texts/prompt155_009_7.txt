"Come on Eric, you really need to eat something. I know you don't want to, but that hunger pain in your gut isn't going to go away on its own", said Gluttony.

"Nobody is judging you Eric. Besides, caring what other people think of you is fruitless. The trick is learning to love yourself the way you are", said Sloth.

"You can be just as happy as the couple in this movie, Eric. When you're ready and the timing is right, you will find love too", said Lust.

"Sure this house isn't the nicest place, but things will get better at work and you'll be able to live where you want to", said Greed.

"Stop beating yourself up. Depression is painful but it doesn't mean you're weak. It's a long fight and you'll lose some battles, but you can win the war if you keep fighting", said Wrath.

"You aren't the only one who struggling with this. Even though they have the fancy car, nice job, and big family they feel the same way sometimes. Everyone faces the darkness at some point", said Envy

"You just don't understand!" said Eric, "I'm fucking cursed. Nothing takes away the pain, nothing fills the emptiness, nothing makes me feel...**anything!** It's like being stuck in an endless cycling void that keeps getting darker and colder and none of you bastards knows what that's like. Just shut up and leave me alone!"

"We do know Eric", said Pride. "We know what it's like to be trapped, stuck in the darkness with our pain forever. That's what being a ghost is. Each of us has become that pain that plagued us in life. We want to help you, to keep you from becoming one of us. But we can't force that to happen. The first thing that you have to do is accept that this is your burden. No it isn't fair, but it's your's nonetheless."

"Fine! I accept it! I'm fucking cursed, didn't you hear me?!"

"Good. Now let us teach you how to deal with curses."
