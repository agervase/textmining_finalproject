I tooke the sandwhich and went home dumbfounded, not knowing if my superpower was experiencing a bug, but I went into my half cleaned apartment and put my sandwhich back into the fridge and I would have forgotten about it for the next couple of days. During those days I have forgotten about the sandwhich, and the knowledge of saving 5 billion people has also seemingly faded away along with the memory of the sandwhich, until I saw a commercial for subway and I remembered my anomolous sandwhich and it's weird effect on supposedly 5 billion people. 

&#x200B;

I started to think about how long a subway sandwhich can last in a fridge before it gets spoiled, and I figured it was okay to eat, and when I felt myself push myself up from my seat I could feel 5 billion souls rejoicing. It was a loud thunderous appluase, of all humans on earth today and even those in the future... I paused in shock as this was the first time this happened. My heart beat started to race as it became obvious that the sandwhich was somehow affecting my psyche and I started to resist the thought of eating the sandwhich. As I did the cheering of 5 billion souls quieted down to a low murmur, I thought I could hear crying even. I didn't know what to do, all I knew this sandwhich was the cause of it... so I left my apartment.

&#x200B;

Since leaving my apartment the noises had stopped, even though I abandoned a couch and a few outfits, those weren't valueable enough to return to that place. Something odd happened as well, my powers seemed to have stopped all together, I had called the paramedics for a traffic accident in which I was the only witnessed, but I didn't sense that I saved anyone's life even though I knew for a fact I did. Shortly after that traffic accident I was actually relieved to not know if whether or not my actions resulted in anyone's fate or not... but all of that was the result of leaving that sandwhich behind. Why did my powers end when I left the sandwhich?

&#x200B;

I started to picture my abandoned apartment, with a solitary sandwhich sitting in the fridge for about 2 weeks now... probably it started to mold. I began to wonder what eating a 2 week old sandwhich would be like and at exactly that moment the roar inside my head began again. Except this time, every person chanting in unison 'eat the sandwhich, eat the sandwhich', louder and louder it became until I couldn't take it anymore. I was in a motel across town and without realizing what I was doing I was running down the sidewalk in the direction of my apartment, and with every step the chanting became louder. My heart beat matched the tempo and cadence of the uproar and I knew what I had to do. I ran about 5 miles, I ran up to my apartment and realized I didn't have my key and I was locked out.

&#x200B;

I started to ram my door with my shoulder to no avail, a neighbor came out and threatened to call the cops, even when I tried to explain it was my apartment they just went back inside with their phone in hand. I saw the lights of the police cars in the parking lot, so with one final push I managed to break my door down. I could hear the police coming up the stair well, the sound of their radio as well as their voices sent a chill down my body. I ran to my fridge and it was open with no sandwhich inside, and at that very moment the 5 billion voices fell silent, the police with their guns drawn approach me and I have no choice but to surrender, as I put my hands up that's when it jumped out.

&#x200B;

From behind the only furniture a creature resembling a subway sandwhich mixed with a dog came running out, the monster pounced one of the police officer's face and liquified the front half of his head, revealing his brain and sinus cavity, blood shot from his esophogus like a fountain as a garbled scream eminated from the fleshy pipe. The monster jumped from one officer to the other's groin and had eaten through his pants and flesh, resulting in his lower entestine falling out from underneath him like a can of jellied cranberries. The monster grew twice it's size in that very moment, and before it could turn around and kill me it just left. Out the door, through the hallway, down the stairs, and out the apartment. I stood there frozen as two dead police officers laid across my floor in a pool of entistines and blood, I could hear a harrowing scream from people out in the parking lot who must have fallen victim to the subway monster. 

&#x200B;

Months following that, the monster would have decimated the majority of all humans... there were no more radio or television or communications. 5 Billion people in total have died and I have no idea if there are any survivors or not. I remain in my apartment with my single couch, as I never leave anymore. The only company I get is from the baby subway monsters that arrive at my apartment and offer themselves as a meal to me, I've been subsisting off of them for a while now, I don't know why they sacrifice themselves to me, perhaps because I'm responsible for allowing them to live. They even come with different combinations of meats and vegtables which I thought was nice, and since they've taken over the world... it's been quiet again.
