He remembered clearly the day his father had been admitted here. For the same reason, he chose to admit himself, having seen the damage that it did to his father's life. 
While furniture had been moved and the walls had been repainted, the lobby was fundamentally the same, the front desk as overbearing and ominous as it had seemed to his five-year-old mind. 

The receptionist, who only now came to his attention (having seemed as inanimate as the aged furniture hugging the walls), shouted to a colleague.
"We got one, and he's not a homeless this time."
She laughed, as if uncaring that she might have been heard. Then moving suddenly, as if in reaction to his expression, stiffened and began apologising profusely. He indicated for her to stop and began explaining himself. 

Midway through, as he began to describe his time at university, a figure rounded the corner. The shapes resolved through unreasonably dim lighting into a young man wearing a nurse's uniform. 
Both men recognised one another, though the now patient could not quite remember where from. 
The nurse quickly smiled and commented:
"Oh, it's you. Follow me."
Without a choice, the patient complied and quickly found that his body was moving automatically as if he knew where to go.

They stopped, having moved quickly through a maze of corridors, and hallways. The nurse fumbled around with keys for a few seconds, before struggling to open the rusted lock.
He smiled.
"Your dad is in there."

Opening the door, the patient walks into the room. Inside was a man, older than the patient remembered him. The room's interior was very well kept in comparison to the rest of the facility. 

The patient's father said:

"So you see them too, I had wondered whether this would happen. By the way, you do know that the staff are dead, right? We are the only living in the hospital. The nurse, the receptionist, the psychologist, they are all just fading ghosts, they're dead."
