The last star fizzled out, and the liquid in the bowl became pure darkness once again.

"That was fun!" The boy grinned. "Let's go again!"

"It's not fair! It's not fair!" The girl complained, her brows scrunched up. "I made them love each other even more and they ended up killing those who loved differently. That makes no sense."

"Maybe you shouldn't have appeared to them in so many different forms at the start, too." The boy cocked his head to one side. "They ended up killing each other because they all had a different idea who you were, and they all wanted to be correct. I barely had to do anything, really."

"Being God is so hard! It's like they don't want to survive, always finding some weird reason to fight one another over."

"Hey, at least you united them for a century!"

"That was after the polar bears all died and the world started flooding!" The girl started to cry, burrowing her face deep into her hands. "All they wanted to do was to brag about their lives on their stupid phones!"

The excitement the boy felt at winning again evaporated.

"Hey, how about this time I'll be God, and you play the Devil? I'm sure you'll do better this time."

"R-Really?"

"Yeah! You can do all kinds of fun things as the Devil! Like throwing an asteroid and killing all the dinosaurs," he smiled encouragingly.

"I don't want to do that!"

"Oh," the boy faltered. "Then maybe you want to try creating something really cool!"

Her ears perked up at that."M-maybe this time I'll make a bunch of aliens to come invade Eden!" She sniffled. "A race that doesn't slaughter its own kind for stupid reasons!"

"Okay, it's settled, then! I'll be God."

"Okay!"

"[Let there be light.](https://reddit.com/r/soIwroteathing/)" With a bang, the dark liquid started swirling. As the bowl started to fill with stars, the universe came alive once more. The two children stared eagerly into infinity, excited to play again.
