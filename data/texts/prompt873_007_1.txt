Atlantis was mobilising is military. It was quite easy, as to be expected, to build a large and mostly hidden navy under the guise of being a peaceful kingdom. In truth, the bombing had done nothing- Atlantians had long ago moved to explosion resistant bunkers and the initially visible city was totally abandoned and slowly crumbling to the force of Korean missiles.
Technological research, over years upon years upon decades was finally pulling some weight and Atlantis now had some of the most energy efficient and powerful naval weapons ever seen. 
Only a small problem remained- how on earth would they get to North Korea? It would be quite difficult and even with advanced technology they would need a certain mode of transport and bases closer to their long-term enemy.
Senate Minister Johan Alervein made a well planned decision- Giant scoops of land from China, Japan, South Korea and even Russia were bought, costing trillions and their fleet was mobilised into the new territory. North Korea still considered it a minor threat- from the outside it seemed just a few regular submarines and a dozen ships (Not very threatening), and even if it was a threat wouldn't their allies (Russia and China) protect them?

Everything was over in a matter of minutes. A shock wave shattered through their military bases instantly disabling any arms they had and the Atlantian military vastly outnumbered and outgunned the rusty guns still being used by the enemy- It was a fast victory and built an image of Atlantis coming in for conquest.
But one thing they didn't know, was that the largest danger lay in their smallest ally- Luxembourg.

Note: This is partially based on what usually happens in a game of Civ5 and may not be the best. I was planning on using my current novel concept of multiple animal species fighting over land, but decided it would take a while and make my writing worse.
