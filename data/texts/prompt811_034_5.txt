It's the last few minutes of my shift and some damned human has the audacity to summon me. I have no choice in the matter so I take another bite from my centipede and enter the dimensional gateway to "Terra".
But what's this? The summoner is way too young to summon anything. I mean he's so young he wouldn't even be allowed to summon a measly haunted soul. But to summon ME. The devils substitute responder himself? What a stupid joke.
Whatever. That means I can go back to hell, go home and take a nice, long lava-bath. 
"Thomas you bastard who're you talking to? There's no one here despite you and me!" says a deeper voice slowly getting closer. The man is slurring his words, not only that but the last part he said had a sound of malicious intend in it. 
For the first time I look my summoner in the eye and see tears on his face. But he's not crying anymore. His face is best described as one of pure hatred. Hatred directed towards the man who inspired it in the first place. 
As his father comes down the stairs I decide to conduct a little experiment. 
I'm usually not allowed to do that on the job, but technically my shift is already over so I'm on my own time which means I will do however I please. 
I transfer the kid some of my powers. As his eyes start glowing red the face of his father, who's now standing directly in front of us, but can't see me, turns from a wicked smile to that of man scared for his life. In a weak attempt to survive what he knows is coming he tries to kick his son, but the kid just grasps the leg and throws him to the floor in one move, shattering his fathers head on the cold stone floor. As he dies I grab his soul.
I look at the boy and he says two words. "Thank you". Wait. Does he think this is it? He thinks this is free? Oh what a poor little thing you are.
I freeze every muscle in his body so he can't move and slowly stick my claws right through his little body, absorbing his soul. While we're at it, I might as well leave a mark remembering him that he killed his own father every time he looks at it. After all we demons live off of the humans bad emotions. So I also take out an eye and eat it right in front of him. Yummy. As I unfreeze him the boy screams in agony and runs outside to search for help. Whatever kid, my job here is done.
As I return back to hell I'm quite satisfied with the situation. I had to work a little longer, but twice the souls means twice the bonus and I also just got a delicatesse for free.
Back home I relax, smiling and happy at the fact that the humans really can't get their shit together.
