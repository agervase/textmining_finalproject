Turns out a shaman denouncing me for heresy before a king will catch the attention of a god. Turns out I was wrong, but just because there is a god does mean he knows all. His punishment was immortality, apparently he didn't get the memo that, immortality is exactly what many of us dream of. It was actually pretty terrifying with that deep overpowering voice that seemed to echo off every wall and fill my entire head.

**You seem to think me a joke, I am no such thing. You want a joke, I can give you one. I give you the gift of immortality, the curse of suffering till you bow to me and declare me your God. Until then, I give you another gift, a single vision through my eyes. Do you see it mortal? The sun your kind so often mistake for myself, you will be getting a much more uncomfortable view of it soon. As soon as about 7.6 billion years. Then you die -your mortality will fail you. You will suffer.**

The curse truly was a gift, more of a gift than he knew at the time. While he sat back and waited for the sun to destroy my planet, I was finding a way to turn his gift around. I spent my first three hundred thousand years trying to find a way to kill a god. I found about as many useless riddles as I had expected. But one of them led me to a cave in the Himalayas, looking for a rib of a snow leopard. I found a small cave I heard a local had spotted one near. I found in the cave, not a leopard but a pond. A pond that contained the galaxies, there were hundreds of them. It was then that I found the leopard, or the leopard found me. It spoke -it scared me -I fell -I was scared. I landed on my ass here. on Velantra a planet of pacifists and scholars. It was fairly easy to rough up my empire where I spent most of these billions of years become a god to the Velans. I went from an alien who lived endlessly to a god in about a thousand years or so. They advanced quickly, faster than humans. It took a lot of searching through the galaxies for our probes to find it. Earth, at last! The Velans predicted Earth to perish in roughly two hundred years. God, I cut it close. The tables had turned, I was now sitting back and waiting for my home planet to blow and beat a gods curse.

I sat back waiting and waiting, sustainability of life on earth was reaching the end. I was sitting back on the most expensive chair on Velantra made of resources from a planet from the most recent planet we have reached. I was surprised how close the sun got to earth and people still live and the-

**You think you have outsmarted me mortal? All this time and you haven't studied my words to you? The words of a god? The god. YOUR GOD. You were told your immortality would fail you the day Earth expired. I did not mean it would be the day your immortality would turn into endless suffering. I told you it would FAIL. You are not as smart as you thought.**

My joints went first, my hair grayed, my voice ached. My fingers to weak to hold the glass of Vethal.

And now you are caught up with no explanation on how I built the majority of my empire here. I plan on living through this and I don't need you trying to replicate my empire. I'm as much a god as him at this point I can beat him.

The tears are rolling down my cheeks, I begged. "PLEASE GOD DON'T DO THIS! I SUBMIT YOU ARE MY GOD! I DECLARE IT! PLEASE LET ME LIVE!" 

**You are pathetic mortal. You have given me all I wanted why would I let you live now? I have won.**

"No. No, no..." Think, god dammit! THINK. "Why go through all this, destroy a world. Give me 7.8 billion years if it all ends and not one person knows?  Let me live as an example, an example of a pathetic fool who failed to outsmart a god!"

**No.**

I died.

But I saw it. The promise land. A land full of potential, potential for my next empire. Hell, full of all these nitwits who are frozen in time and learned nothing in their time alive. I will still beat a god. That fool of a god. I will have to outsmart the Devil first. Then he I get that piece of shit.
