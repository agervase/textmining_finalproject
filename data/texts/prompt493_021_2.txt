She was my world. You know how in every love story they say "you just know". Well id like to tell you that's true. But it aint... at least not entierly. 

She was loud and obnoxious in public. But get her alone and her more quiet thoughtful side came out. 

I wasn't a fan of either. At first. The extroverted Ivy was off the wall. And the introverted Ivy was way too quiet in comparison to the other. It felt like two different people. 

It started with her joining our house. Jeff left to take care of his dying dad and we needed the room filled. It was Me, Jake, Esperansa, Lilly, and her. We were a squad, a weird one, but at least we had eachother.   

One night I kinda felt like shit and didn't go out with the rest, turns out she didn't go out that night either. 

As I crawled out if my room head banging from a migraine she opened her door quietly and asked me softly if we could talk. I had just taken some pills and figured they would kick in soon enough so I said sure. 

She took a seat on the couch. "Do you hate me or something?" She asked. 

"Nah, hate is a strong word." 

"Then why do I feel like you do? Be honest I know something's up." 

In a mood where I had no tolerance for anything past short and to the point I said. "You're like two people. When we go out you're like every other electric glitterbomb, and when we're home you're beyond quiet. Sometimes it's like you aren't even listening or participating in anything were doing. It's the contrast j don't like. Feels like both are fake and I don't dig that." 

She sat. And looked down at her hand curled up in her lap for a moment. "I. I guess it's because here I feel like the tagalong. The addition. And you guys are all so close already." 

"Well I can't speak for the others, but I know you're always included in whatever I'm doing. I'm pretty blatant. Door open." I gestured to my door ajar. "Come on in. Door closed. I'm mostly busy but feel free to knock." 

A small smile managed to slip out. "Okay." She said. 

"Now well you excuse me I'm going to pass out" I said getting off the couch and grabbing my Gatorade. "Goodnight." 

"I hope your headache goes away." She said.

"Yea haha, me too." 

And both our doors shut.

After that talk Ivy and I began hanging out a lot more. And soon enough it was almost a guarantee that if my door was open she was with me. 

Gaming. Reading. Movies. Homework. 

Eventually it became obvious to everyone but myself. But we became a thing. It was only after Esper nonchalantly asked how the night before was that I realized. 

"What do you mean?" 

"The moaning and giggling." 

"We were watching a movie!" I said 

"Mhmm sure. That's what WE were doing every night that we were doing THAT too." She said a sly smile peaking around her coffee. 

Taken by surprise I kinda just stood there. Ivy didn't know about mine and Espers antics months ago and my eyes quickly darted to her still closed door. 

"Shut the fuck up!" I whispered, the urgency in my voice making it not so quiet. 

"I seem to remember that phrase a lot when Lilly and Jake got home too." Another chuckle coming out of her. "Obviously it'll happen soon if it hasn't yet though. I mean look at how you reacted. If you didn't care. You wouldn't be shushing me." 

Esperansa left for her room leaving me dumb and disoriented in the kitchen. A pan of scrambled eggs in one hand and a spatula in the other when Ivy came out of her room. 

"That true?" 

"I.. is what true?" I tried to feign nonchalance. 

"You caring about me." 

"I. Uh. Well. Um." All while I stuttered I was actually screaming *"say something you absolute dipshit, Jesus fuck"* 

And before I could get out of my stammering loop of idiocy I found her lips on mine. That was the end of that. It was locked in.

We were perfect. It was perfect. 

Until that night. 

Ivy came home sobbing, bleeding and scared. Clothes torn to shit and hair messed up beyond what wind could do.

"What happened!" I shouted.

"Jumped, they. They took my shit and two tried. Tried to." 

I didn't give her time to finish. I went in my room and grabbed my nailbat, a stupid thing Jake and I made, it was for shits and giggles when we did it but man I was happy to have it then.

"WHERE?" 

"A-ally two blocks down." 

"I'll be right back." 

"Austin. You aren't allowed to die. Not tonight." 

Hopped up on rage I obviously didn't realize what was rushing into. The blood were from knives. The bruses from bats. But I wasn't thinking.

"Promise me!" She pleaded. Tears running down her face 

Murder in my eyes and a snarl on my lips I looked at her, Lilly hovering over her already cleaning her arms. And said with every fiber of my being. "I promise. And I will be right back." 

And walked out the door. 
__________________________________________

The bastards were still in the ally 6 of them. Drunk. Howling at passers by who were avoiding the ally. A few of them miming lewd acts. One of them talking about "That green eyed bitch." 

The rain was coming down pretty hard outside their little overhang keeping them dry so they didn't hear my boots hitting the pavement before my bat was already cracked against ones head, sending it into  the wall. 

I wish I could say I said something cool. But I was filled with only fire and hate. 

I managed to swing at one more, missing, but catching his face with the nails. Before a third and a fourth rushed from the side. 

I managed to hit the smaller one square in the temple, knocking him into the other and tripping him.

The big guy came down on me mid trip as a halfway failed tackle. Bat clattered off to the left right into the rain. 

I squirmed and kicked the big guy in the face and got the bat to hit one more when the big guy came out of his daze and stabbed me in the leg. 

I remember going down and the big guy getting up. 

I remember the guy I grazed and the one I didn't holding me by my arms. And the big guy now with a broken nose tossing blows in my face.

Where I was once seeing red i was now bleeding it all over the ally. Blood running all the way down and into the storm drain. 

I remember looking up as the big guy took my bat and drove it down at me....

________________________________________

And then I remember waking up. It was still raining. The three of them were gone but the gore of my action remained. 3 bodies slumped on the ground and me. The bat off to my side and my face hurting like a mother fucker.

I got up. And walked home.

What the fuck happened were Lilly's first words. As I looked down and saw how covered in blood I was. 

"I. I don't know." I said. "How's Ivy?" 

"Shell be okay till morning but we need to take her to the hospital. But answer this. Is that your blood or theirs, because you look like they didn't touch you." 

"What?" 

I glanced in the mirror. It looked like I had just stepped out of the shower and put on mad max prop clothes.

"I. I don't know. I need to sleep." 

I walked over to Ivy fast asleep, bandaged up. "Is she okay to be moved?" 

"Yea should be. But be careful. I'm coming in to check in the morning." 

"Fine." As I picked Ivy up and carried her into my room. 
________________________________________
That was over 200 years ago now. Ivy and I got married the year after that happened. 

The cops dragged off the bodies and chalked it up to gang so I never got screwed. 

We lived a happy life. For a few years. Till She was hit in a high speed chase. Said she died in impact. 

Don't know what she did. But I'm still around. Still 25. Still have the bat. Along with some other stuff of ours. 

Guys who killed her died years and years ago. Wish I could say I had a part in it but I didnt. 

Now I'm faced with the fact that something she did made me imortal. And now I'm stuck knowing that whatever magic she had died with her. Along with all the love I had for the world.

I feel like a less cool wolverine. Fuck man I know why he drank so much. 

Only issue is I still get the hangover.




Sorry for any formatting issues and the rushed story wrote this on my phone pretty late with some very real hunger going on. Hope you guys enjoyed it.
