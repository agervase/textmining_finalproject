I go by Zera, now. 

&nbsp;

A103 is my real name, technically. The serial identification was given to me when my embryo was first created and stored in The Ark.  It’s a system that is populated by humans but managed by machines. It is tattooed on my left forearm, as is everybodys. Except, of course, those working in the mech repair zone.  It is said they stem from a mutated batch of embryos whose left arms did not grow passed the elbow. Apparently it is not needed to repair mechs since they all are placed there.    

&nbsp;

Removing my mark is the second step to joining the resistance. 

&nbsp;

The first is to bring an essential component of a mech. It didn’t matter how you got it. Just that you possessed a piece crucial to its functionality.  How I came into possession of a mechs battery is a story for another time.  It was easier than expected, truth be told. All that mattered was carried it now, in my messenger bag. 

&nbsp;

I walked to the agreed upon location.  Dia was already waiting for me. Her arms were crossed and she paced in circles. 

&nbsp;

“Do you have it?  If you don’t they’ll be pissed, *I’ll be pissed*,” she corrected herself. 

&nbsp;

Dia was my handler, my mentor. She was a member of the resistance. She recruited me on the factory floors where I toiled smelting raw ores into more readily useable forms. Not everyone listened to the whispers from others like her.  I listened. And I learned. I learned of the history of our Earth. I learned how there, people programmed the mechs. The more I learned, the angrier I became.  I pitied the sheep around me. Their willful ignorance of reality is depressing. 

&nbsp;

They could not be totally to blame, however. We are  taught from birth that order is essential to the success of the mission: the preservation of humanity.   To ask questions or disobey an order was blasphemous.  So we are taught...

&nbsp;

“Yea, of course.” I lifted the flap of my bag and showed her its contents. 

&nbsp;

She smiled, “Good! Let’s get going.”

&nbsp;

We walked west for two kilometers before coming to a cavern shielded by a large stone. She waved her hand in front of a small crack and the stone disappeared. It was a hologram. 

&nbsp;

“If you wish to turn back, now is the time.”

&nbsp;

I shook my head. 

&nbsp;

I followed her in, careful not to hit my head on the low hanging stalactites that dripped liquid onto the slick floor below. I followed her as we walked through a maze of progressively tighter paths.  

&nbsp;

When it seemed as though we would be stuck, the path opened to a small cavern. I’m the middle was a lone chair with arm and leg shackles. 

&nbsp;

“Sit,” she commanded. 

&nbsp;

I did as she said. 

&nbsp;

“The shackles are to keep you from moving while we remove your mark.”

&nbsp;

“I understand.”

&nbsp;

She locked my hands and feet to the chair.

&nbsp; 

“*Zera*, is it?” She rolled her eyes, “Where do you think we are right now?”

&nbsp;

“Umm.. I.. I don’t know.  Headquarters for the resistance?”

&nbsp;

“Idiot,” she said, “there is not such thing as *’the resistance’*.”

&nbsp;

“What do you mean?”

&nbsp;

“We are under the mech repair zone.  There is a freight elevator not far off.”

&nbsp;

“I… I don’t understand.”

&nbsp;

“What do you think would happen if there was a resistance?  If people stopped working for the greater good?  We are all that is left of our species.  We cannot fail.”

&nbsp;

“But, the mech.  I have its battery!” 

&nbsp;

“Did it ever give you pause at how easy it was to disarm the mech?  It was disabled long before you happened upon it.”  

&nbsp;

It hadn’t.

&nbsp;

“I am sorry if you felt lied to.  It is what we do, The Shepherds.  We guard the flock against dissenters, such as yourself.  Those too weak to stay the course.  But, there was some truth.  We are going to have to remove your mark.”  

&nbsp;

She snapped her fingers.  Out from the shadows emerged two mechs.  One carried an ugly, serrated blade that is dragged along the ground behind it.  The other turned on a blowtorch and put the flame to a jagged piece of sheet metal.  In a few seconds, the metal was glowing red.

&nbsp;

“Under the mech repair zone,” her words traced back through my head.  

&nbsp;

I remembered of all the repair workers and their mangled left arms.  My stomach turned to stone. 

&nbsp;

“Please don’t do this!!!” I begged.  Tears streamed down my face and onto my lap.

&nbsp;

“Sorry, A103, but this is the only option.  You will be reprogrammed to forget all of this.  Tomorrow you will wake up and go to work repairing mechs with others similar to yourself.  You’ll be in good company.”

&nbsp;

I screamed in protest, but the mechs weren’t programmed to respond to emotion.  They closed in on me. 

&nbsp;

The lead mech raised its arm and brought it down.  It missed me, or so I thought until I looked on the ground and saw an arm with a mark.  

&nbsp;

My mark.  

&nbsp;

I looked at the stump where my arm should have been connected to the elbow.  Blood was oozing out.

&nbsp;

I followed the arm of the other mech as lifted the red-hot metal and gently pressed it to the end of my bleeding stump.  

&nbsp;

The pain that had been absent until this point ripped through me.  It blinded me.  I clenched my teeth and howled.

&nbsp;

I passed out.

&nbsp;

- - -

I woke up in a panic.  My sheets, which were drenched in sweat, clung to my body.  I looked down at my arm and sighed in relief.  It hadn’t been real.   

&nbsp;

Hurriedly, I got ready for the day, then threw on my overcoat before stepping out of my barracks.  It was time to go to work and I was running late. 

&nbsp;

I glanced down again and was satisfied.  My mark was right where it had always been.  *It was just a nightmare after all.*

&nbsp;

I ran to the entrance and let the admin mech scan my mark before heading to my workstation.  On my way, I saw Dia.

&nbsp;

“Time to repair some mechs, eh?” she asked.

&nbsp;

I nodded and smiled.  “*Time to repair some mechs*,” I thought.  I fitted my prosthetic limb and began to work on the project in front of me.  It would be a quick fix.  All it needed was a new battery.
