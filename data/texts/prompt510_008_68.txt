They fell away from her as if she were diseased.

Curious, I kept watching and saw as their faces would twist with horror and revulsion, before moving aside to let her pass or going to the other side of the street altogether. Witnessing this happening a few more times, I got up from the bench were I was seated and drew closer, offering her a slight smile.

"Hi, um, I don't mean to be rude, or nosy- But is there a reason why everyone avoids you?"

She looked startled as I spoke. Her eyebrows drew into a curiosity filled frown, before she replied "Yes, yes there is. I am Death. Those who look upon me see my appearance based on how they feel about death. You... See me differently, don't you?"

I did.

 I felt as though with her I would always be happy- That I would finally find peace. I nodded with some difficulty, and her expression grew sad.

"I am not what you look for, despite what you may think."

"What do you-"

"I have met many like you, over the years. Those who believe that they will find tranquility, and peace in me. They are wrong, you are wrong." She placed her hand gently on my cheek for a moment, eyes searching mine, and I shivered.

Even as we stood here people gave her a wide berth, their eyes barely glancing across her before dancing away quickly in fear. 

"Go." She said softly, taking her hand away. "You are still young. Life isn't as cruel as you might believe. You have much to live for."

Turning away, she offered me a sad smile and a small wave over her shoulder, walking through the crowd and leaving me more than a little stunned, gaping at the spot she stood until she was long gone.

And later I would meet her, years later, still as entrancingly beautiful as the first time we met, and she would smile and take my hand.

"You have lived a good life. You are ready."
