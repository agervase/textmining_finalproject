Boss puts his hand on my shoulder. Big ol spiky thing, wish I had that many spikes, I just got the horns, boss man's covered in the stuff. Guess that's why he's boss. 

>You're one of my best petty demons,

he says

>Four human-years ago I instructed you the very specific task of disrupting the careers of thousands of potential writers. Doesn't seem like an important job - Grkl'rock over there for example is fomenting terrorist cells in London - but it's important, because I fucking hate literature, and the last time we let the humans get good at this, they wrote "Paradise Lost." Yuck. 

I tell him, "thanks boss, that means a lot." 

>Hold on. I'm not complimenting you. You were doing great, the whole "distract them by making them write 'anthropomorphized embodiment of good/evil characters instead of real human characters' strategy, genius. Totally disrupted their ability to actually write a real character. But you went too far. Now I'm everywhere, I'm a joke, there's goddamn meta prompts being written about me and I *know* you're not in charge of that, Kerk'nefggu, so don't even try to take credit for it. 

I tell him, "I'm sorry boss, I don't know what to do, it's kind of gotten out of control."

>It's alright. There's a reason I am where I am. Here's what you gotta do - spin up a couple more meta prompts about this - maybe write up one with "God puts a heavy hand on your shoulder" or "Hitler stops his favorite activity - writing writing prompts," something like that. Gets a chuckle and makes light of the situation. That'll guarantee no significant changes happen. Then, give it two weeks, take some time off, get an acid bath or something, and come human-February you can launch right back into it. In the meantime, I have an inauguration to plan.
