**George, the Professor, and the Beginning of the End**

***Click***

Goddamnit, I can never tell if this blasted thing is working or not. Good old academia throwing money right at our feet to make this hulking piece of–

*I’m telling you, professor, just record all the tests on your phone and you can put it all on your personal pulpit there if we ever find anything.*

Hey once you get a building wing named after you, you’ll get to run the show however you like. But until then… Everything set-up to record?

*Yep, everything is good to go on this end.*

Alright here we go again, this is test number 52–

*I was also thinking if nothing ever comes of this you could sell all these recordings as alternatives to sleeping pills, probably make a fortune too. Maybe as lulla–*

Test number 524 of the Quarks Under Applied Nano-Tension Microscope, which will be further referred to as the QUANTuM. The test parameters have been altered from test 523 to include an increase of 0.00001 pico-Newtons to a new maximum of 0.00143. The aperture and charge of the surface have been kept constant.

Alright, George. Start her up whenever you’re ready, just let me know when we get down to quark level.

*Yes, ma’am.*

…

*We’re there ma’am. Anything to change before I charge the accelerator plates.*

Nope, just maybe cross your fingers and hope for something, anything other than black.

*Plates charging. Professor?*

Yes, George…

*At what point, ma’am, are we going to be forced to accept that quarks truly are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. I mean it would be almost as big a breakthrough as discovering a further division of particles. No offense, of course, I just wonder if your brilliance and my staggering good looks might be better used on some other universe shattering, excuse the hyperbole, project.*

None taken. You know the impossibility of proving a negative and the near impossibility at even hinting at one and getting anyone to listen. If every crazy theory and every even crazier solution proposed in science was proven true you and I would be immortal, riding our own golden spaceships through the cosmos. But the universe would also a boring shit of a place with no questions left to answer.

Anyway, you get back to staring into the unending blackness that seems to be the building block of our universe and I’ll get back to my book. Each to our own fun.

*I can’t think of **anything** more fun.*

…

*OH SHIT, MA’AM. I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE THIS.*

What is it George, a slightly darker shade of black? And I was getting to a good bit too.

*No actually if you just look there, it almost seems to be the oppos–*

HOLY FUCKING SHIT IS THAT A WHITE DOT?

*And its growing in size too. I checked the screen no dead pixels, the dot moves as we move the lens. We’re at 9 pixels now up from 1 six minutes–*

YOU WAITED SIX MINUTES TO TELL ME. I COULD HAVE HAD AN UNEXPECTED ANEURYSM AND DIED IN THAT TIME.

*I had to check and double check to ensure I wasn’t imagining it and more importantly didn’t want to get murdered after getting your hopes up.*

Touché.

Oh, fucking shit did I ever remember to turn this fucker back on.

*It’s been running for 1 hour 37 minutes and 12 seconds now so my money is on you forgetting to ever pause it.*

Hey, laugh all you want now because after I attach this tape to the paper when it's published, all you will be remembered for is making fun of the professor who redefined our understanding of the universe.

Alright, it has been… 47 minutes and.. 23 seconds since the accelerating plates were turned on. At the… George when was it first detected? 

*The 40 minutes and 44 seconds mark.*

Yes at that time point the computer detected an alteration of 1 pixel from black to white and this change was confirmed by eye. The white speck has grown and now a pure white light has filled half of the screen and is seeming to grow at an increasingly rapid rate.

Can you pull up the feed on the other monitor and review the footage for any inconsistencies?

The white light has come to completely fill the screen, the rate of growth seems to be approximately exponential. While these images may not provide data complete enough to articulate the properties of this new particle we now know exactly where it occurs within the quark and have concrete evidence for its existence.

*Professor, I believe a pixel just switched to black at the previous point of origin.*

There appears to be a black circle increasing in size at the center of this newly discovered particle.

30 seconds later and we are left with a black screen. Although… sorry, George did a pixel just flash again at the origin point?

*Yep, no mistaking it.*

Alright “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.” Any alterations from the initial particle found within the quark, George?

*Only that the edges seem almost soft, give me 30 seconds and I’ll have enough resolution to zoom in on the edge in the footage and maybe give you a more definite answer.*

*Right, we have two changes. One, there is a very slight but very definite difference between the origin and the center of the white circle on the screen. Two, there seem to be millions of bright specks surrounding the white circle.*

Do you think this could be some strange equivalent to a nucleus and electrons? Shit, this could break the science would apart farther than we thought possible.

*Professor another white circle has already come to form, and I can even now tell that there are far more specks than in the previous. Also, they seem to be filling in the circle more not extending from it with each pass if the exponential rates are correct.*

Can you zoom in on the specks at the top? I want to see if we might be able to get a better look at them… 

I, holy shit… I think… 

*What, I don’t see it?*

How? What would even… I mean that’s just not possible…

*Please for all that is holy in this world just tell me.*

They’re stars and galaxies. You can practically see the organization at work. You can almost see the spiral arms of this one here.

*That’s not possible though, what are you saying that each quark contains a universe within itself?*

I mean… yes, that is what I’m saying.

*Fuck…*	

*I just…*

*Fuck…*

*Oh, fuck no.*

What did I miss? You can see the galaxies clearly in the footage. 

*I’m not looking at the footage anymore professor turn around, look at the real-time images.*

…It’s like a flipbook of a galaxy with a giant white circle retreating within. God its beautiful George isn’t it… Right George?... George what are you doing, take your eyes off the data for a damned second and look at what may be an entire universe caught in one image.

*Ma’am, I’m sorry but that’s why I’m looking. I cross-referenced stills of some of the galaxy clusters that we can see at the edge of the white circle and if I’m not mistaken they correlate with clusters within our own galaxy.*

There’s no fucking way. This would mean that what we have found is not just a discovery of a more fundamental piece of the universe but also a discovery of the universe itself.

*That’s not all not even by a long shot. If the estimations of current astronomers are correct, this is not only our galaxy but also our galaxy at the present moment.*

You’re saying that the calculations suggest this is our galaxy at the present moment, there’s no… fucking… way…

*I’m comparing with the new images we’re getting from the areas being uncovered and everything seems to suggest so. They actually suggest that this is an image of the galaxy slightly in the future, but either they or I must have gotten something slightly off cause that is impossible unless spacetime has been broken.*

Okay, okay, okay, what do we know… Okay, give me both the center of the shrinking circle and cross-reference all the past images to see if the galaxy chart is changing.

*Do you have a hunch about what’s going on with all of this?*

Just get me the information as soon as you can.

*Yeah, yeah no problem just give me a second.*

*The circle seems to be centered somewhere in the milky way galaxy and the—*

Any more specific than that?

*Our general section of sky maybe, I could try to be more specific but I’d be guessing…*

And…

*And what?*

The galaxy chart for god sakes.

*Oh right, right… The best I can tell there does seem to be a slight shift. The more the circle shrinks, the closer the galaxies seem to get to the prediction of their current positions.*

Let’s assume that this white light that expands to encompass the entire universe is emanating from the earth and is set to begin at some unspecified point in the near future, any theories as to the cause?

*Nothing that could be assumed to be true with what we know of time and physics.*

I can’t believe I’m saying this, but throw that out the window.

*I mean potentially we’re seeing all futures within a single image.*

And the white circle.

*Maybe free-will causes a shroud of chaos of sorts which through the butterfly effect emanates outwards through the universe. I mean the only other thing I can possibly think of is if there were to be some way to break the fundamental fabric of the universe.*

Which before today we thought was a quark, correct?

*oh shit*

SHUT IT DOWN. SHUT IT ALL–
