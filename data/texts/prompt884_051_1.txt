There was something about her tone. I should have seen this coming, but I was proud, and like they say, pride comes before the fall.

"Wow, these cable ties are really thick, you really went all out. Oh but they're so tight, my wrists hurt, oh please."

I didn't speak, I led her silently into the basement.

"Oh, not the basement! Oh that's a lot of locks, big heavy door. Is that steel? Oh no!"

As we entered the room, she took in the sights. This is when they begin to understand. This is when they start to break. Not her. 

"Oh my gosh, is that chair custom? Stainless, articulated, and those are the biggest shackles I've ever seen! Oh wow this is nice soundproofing. Now no one will be able to hear me scream! Oh please, let me go!"

But there were no tears, no sobs, it was sarcasm. The bitch!

I placed her in the chair. My chair, my design, my work. I was so proud of that chair. So many women have known this chair. I'd have lost count ages ago were it not for my souvenirs. Two eyes from each victim, enough that I had to buy a second deep freeze.

 I shackled her legs first, then used my pocket knife to slice the zip tie around her wrists, making a show of dragging it across her neck along the way. Then I shackled her hands, her waist, and her neck.

"Oh boy, I'm done for now! I can't move at all. No way out of this pickle!"

Pickle! She actually said pickle! Who the hell says that in a situation like this?!

"Hey I just noticed you put a lot of tarp down. That's good thinking, makes cleanup a lot quicker. But how do you, oh, you have an incinerator. Just toss the tarp in with what's left of me, right? Smart."

Unfazed, I walked over to the surgical table and unwrapped my tools. 

"Hey that's a nice tool wrap. Oh wow, look at those. The medical supply place on third, right? They carry great stuff, but pricey! Good for you, you must do very well for yourself. You really went all out."

Slowly, deliberately, I reached for the scalpel. Familiar, common, I found it inspired fear more than my less conventional tools. 

I began my work. 

"Oh god! Not my fingernails! Oh Jesus that hurts! Ah you absolute sadist! Ahh Christ it's like being sliced up by an apprentice butcher! Fuck!"

Slowly, carefully, I finished her right hand, where her nails had been there was only blood and bone. I turned around to walk to the other side to do her left. That's when it happened. 

In a flash of pain, I fell to the ground. My bone chisel protruding from the back of my right knee. As I tried to stand, her left hand flashed across my tools and drove a cannula into my throat.

As I scrambled to get away, to breathe, she used her free hand to pick the remaining shackles. She was so fast.

She walked, *sauntered* over to me, I slashed at her with the scalpel, but she plucked it from my hand, kicked me over, and slashed my achilles tendon. I scrambled away, she slashed the other one.

Then she just waited. I tried for the tools, she kicked me away. I tried the door, but couldn't reach the locks. I couldn't breathe, I was bleeding out. And then it all went black. 

I woke up in the chair. *My chair*. MY FUCKING CHAIR!

My wounds had been dressed, I was shackled, and bound with rope. It was so tight I could barely breathe, let alone move. I tried to speak, but nothing came out. 

"Sorry about that. There was a lot of trauma to your throat, not from me, mind you, but from all your wriggling around afterwards. Honestly, you silly goose. I had to perform a tracheostomy. But hey, you're alive! Lucky you!"

"Now, let me show you how it's done."

She took my scalpel, and began to dissect my fingernails.

"Lucky thing I'm a south paw, huh? Otherwise your little act might have made this harder for me to do."

She moved quickly, but with precision. Such precision. I have to admit, it was art. The pain was unbearable, but there was hardly any blood. When she was done, five perfectly excised fingernails lay on the floor at her feet.

"There! Did you learn anything? Were you watching? Oh silly me, of course you were, it's not like there's a television in here, right?"

She laughed. That laugh, so hearty and innocent, like we were two friends chatting over coffee.

That was the first day. I don't know how much time has passed since. Sometimes it feels like days, weeks go but between her visits. Sometimes she just comes by to refill my IV, clean up my colostomy and catheter bags. Sometimes, she works. But it's been so long. She looks older. She's greying, getting wrinkles. Her face is the only way I can tell time in this place.

It's always the same. First she skins me, then dresses the wound. She removed the muscle and fat, then dresses the wound. She amputates, then dresses the wound. Never whole limbs, oh no, always a few inches at a time. In between bouts of maddening darkness and silence, I've watched my body disappear by inches. 

This can't go on much longer, there's so little of me left. My right arm is gone to the shoulder. My legs, gone. One of my kidneys. One of my lungs. My tongue, my teeth. My left eye. She said she wants me to keep the right eye so I can watch. My face, ears, my scalp, my teeth, my jaw. My... My manhood... Oh god, she took her time there.

 Sometimes she cracks my chest open like a walnut, toys with my heart, and just when I feel the sweet release of death, she brings me back. She always brings me back. 

The only thing she hasn't touched is my left hand. I think it's supposed to be a jab at me, at the work I left unfinished on her, the work I'll *never* finish.

Oh god. I can her her footsteps coming down the stairs.
