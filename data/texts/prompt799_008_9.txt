**PART 1:**

The world ended 40 years ago and on that same day a new one was born. An asteroid, some 80 miles in diameter, had been spied hurtling towards Earth at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The astronomers of that bygone era had spotted it on a direct collision course with our planet, they had told the people and governments of that time that there was less than a year until the extinction of the human race. We could not destroy the asteroid, nor steer it away, there was nothing that could be done. Death approached.

Chaos engulfed the globe, widespread riots, a proliferation of doomsday cults calling from everything from mass suicides to terrorist attacks (to “atone for our sins"), there was a dozen coup attempts a month, insurgent governments formed and snuffed out by the handful. People quit their jobs to spend time with their family. Logistic networks, supply lines, and production networks collapsed. In this chaos famine and disease raged across the planet. Hundreds of millions died.

Over the course of that year, most of the peoples of this world did anything they could to come to terms with the end. Others committed atrocities in some deluded hope that they could appease whatever god(s) or cosmic force that had set this doom upon us, and in doing so prevent the apocalypse.

It was all for naught.

For, on that fateful day, when The Machine arrived, there was no mass extinction event. We had fabricated our own Armageddon as a way to cope with what we thought would be the death of our planet, but death did not come. As the peoples of the world said their final prayers, as they clutched their loved one close, as a thousand ritual suicides took place with each passing minute, the asteroid moved through the moon's orbit.

And then… it *stopped.*

Humanity took a collective gasp. For no apparent reason, and in violation of all known laws of physics, our extinction was forestalled. Cries of joy and relief shook the world as a gargantuan mountain of some strange ivory white material hung in the sky above Eastern Asia. Folk looked up and stared in shock and awe, not knowing what to think, what to do. A moment passed that seemed like an eternity.

As the peoples of the world gazed through sky and screen at the asteroid… it *split*.

Dozens of shards, Monoliths of alien metal, drifted across the sky. Coming to a rest in a grid of 84 points spread equidistant around the globe. What was left of the world’s governments and scientific organizations sent queries to the artifacts from across the stars, they beamed sequences of prime numbers through different methods, they dusted off old manuals on first contact protocols, they trained every scientific instrument imaginable on the Monoliths. Hoping for some sign, communication, reading, any data that could be gathered. They got nothing. No strange emissions on any spectrum. It was as if the Monotone were just masses of inert metal hanging in the sky.

In a few places, some particularly misguided folk tried to attack the alien artifacts that had lead to so much suffering. Eight different monoliths were assaulted with cannon fire and missiles. The projectiles made it nearly to the surface of the Monoliths until they, like The Machine itself, stopped dead in their tracks before drifting harmlessly to the ground.

The Monoliths stayed there for exactly 182,432 seconds, just over 2 days or 50 hours. Then a voice spoke in the mind of every person on earth. Text appeared on every screen, the same message repeated on every speaker in the most common language of each locality.

“WE ARE THE ELDER.

THIS IS BOTH GIFT AND TRIAL.

THE CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE IS THE DEATH OF **ALL** THINGS. NOT THROUGH OUR ACTIONS, BUT IN SPITE OF THEM.

‘THE MACHINE’ CAN GRANT THE PEOPLES OF THIS PLANET POWER BEYOND IMAGINING. ACT WISELY.

WE WISH YOU LUCK.”
