"Liz is being a bit rude," exclaimed Kitties, "I was just trying to get to the catnip!"

"Liz had always been a bit on the bitter bit of the balance of benevolenceness!" laughed Juan.
Juan stretched out his claws in front of him, latching onto white linen, leaning back and putting his cute cat butt in the air, tail straight up. 

"Don't scratch my holmz's new couch, you're not even supposed to be here, Juan!"

"Well am I allowed in or not?" Juan sneered. 

Kitties blushed. 

Later that night Kitties was walking along a brick wall in her back yard when Liz slid his big wod of bod in front of her. Kitties's eyes dialated until there wasn't something she couldn't see. "Damn you scared me Liz. What are you doing?"

Liz stared at Kitties. Kitties breathed. Liz's lizard lenses longingly looked deep into the cat's dome. Liz's eyes bled the period of a 300 pound woman! Liz sprinted toward Kitties!

Earlier that day, Kitties ate breakfast. 

Flashforward back to when Liz sprinted towards Kitties: Kitties dove left off the brick wall plunging toward her holm's back yard grass. After graceful freefall, Kitties glided her paws across the lawn. Liz was nipping at her tail as she was falling whilst lizard walking against the wall and traversed through tall grass almost under the cat. Once Kitties slowed for a second upon opening the cat door, the lizard pounced on the cat and a tussel is assumed to be happening due to tusseling sounds and shadows across the cat door because the camera is still outside facing the cat door. The camera zooms out.

Juan from before jumps through the cat door holding a gun. Punching noises. Liz's lizard voice rang, "Please, no-"  *BANG*

The camera snaps to the two cats and the lizard. The gun had shot a flag saying ice cream surprise,and everyone had ice cream and called it a night. 

The end.
