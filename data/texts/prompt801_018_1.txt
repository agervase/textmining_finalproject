"We know you can hear us John." The female spirit said floating inches from my face. She might have been beautiful in life but in death. Well,  lets just say she was no angel. Especially since half of her face was missing.

I ignore her with every ounce of will power and direct my attention to my wife's photo. Oh Dana. Why?  I haven't had enough. Not nearly enough of you. 

"Cheer up chum. No use cryin over spilled milk or so they say anyway. Im lactose intollerant so." Mr. Funny chimes in with one of his failed zingers. God why now?  Ive never punched anyone but man I wanna punch this guy. But no. Don't encourage them. They will leave when the sun comes up. They always do. 

"Leave him alone you assholes. The guys grieving. Give him some space. Sorry Mr. Lake I'll move them along." Jerremy. Thank christ. Good kid lived next door,  died next door shall I say,  always helped me out. But I cant thank him. Then theyll know for sure.

"Hold your horses boyscout. I'm going. But first." Promqueen floats by me again, blood dripping from the hole on her forehead. "Ever wonder why your wife ain't here big boy?" She cackles. It takes all of my will power not to react but I coudn't help but flinch. 

"He flinched!" Half face screams. He hears us! "Johnny!  Look at me Johnny!  You have to help me!"  They all start shouting in unison. Even Jerremy seems to want my attention now. I desperately cover my ears.

Suddenly a lamp from accross  the room lights up. Dana's side of the bed. And there she is. Sitting on her chair like a few nights ago. But she looks serious, more serious than I've ever seen her. 

"Finally. I've waited so long for you to reveal your talents. Who knew all I had to do was die." She sounded cold. Distant. Not like herself at all. "Get up. Get dressed and follow me."
