(Poem) (First Reddit post also, I think)


The gang all agreed

Joe was odd to this bunch

He came around day after day

And he always brought lunch


Today was the first though

He showed up too soon

He passed out pastrami on wheat

When he entered the room


The money was on the table

He never gave it a second glance

He passed the mayo

Just like an old friend


We were all worried

When He left that day

He left in a hurry

Even after being asked to stay


So I sent out 'ol Charlie

A true thief in the night

He was my right hand man

And always ready to fight


‘Ol Charlie followed Joe

All across town

Joe was moving like a man on a mission

And he wasn’t slowing down


Joe finally stopped 

He passed through a door

Charlie peaked through a window

Not knowing what was in store


When he saw what he saw

His jaw dropped on down

He just couldn’t believe it

But he knew what he found


Charlie high-tailed back to the hideout

With news no one would believe

Innocent old Joe

Was full of mystery


When Charlie crashed in

He had everyone intrigued

He started to talk

But his mouth wouldn’t speak


He felt A warm trickle

Running down his chest

He turned just in time

To see a shadow moveing fast


It couldn’t have been

No way he got here before me

But Charlie wasn’t mistaken

That was Joe he watched flee


In his last seconds

He managed to say

“Joe is a phoney”

And then his eyes went gray


I wasn’t sure

I’d heard what he said 

All I knew now 

Was my friend lay dead


“Joe is a phoney”

I’ve repeated those word

At least a million times

And they still sound absurd


Joe is the odd man out

The guy who buys lunch

He would never accept the fact

That we were a criminal bunch


Today he’s running late

Said he found a new place

Told us the sandwiches were amazing

And we’d never had an so great


When he got to the hideout

He let himself in 

Like he done many times before

He handed us our food with a grin


As the last morsel was finished

He looked me dead in the eye

He asked about ‘Ol Charlie

Said his roast beef was on rye


I nonchalantly told him

That Charlie had a long night

He’d be back here soon

To have himself a bite


Then I saw it in his eyes

A short look of doubt

I wondered what he did

I had to figure it out


Joe was a savant

Ignorant to our way of life

But his demeanor changed

Now tensions could be cut with a knife


I couldn’t stand it

No, not anymore

I had to know what Charlie knew

Why he died on the floor


I asked Joe in front of everyone

With my hand on my Ruger

What did Charlie find out about you

And we’re you last night's shooter


Joe looked at me

In a way that should kill

But we had the upper hand

And the iron will


Joe’s moves were deliberate

And he started to speak

His words were to the point

As he folded his hands on his knees


He told us Charlie had seen

More than he would tell

I couldn’t let him blab back here

Then we'd all have cells


I know you all think I'm clueless

And naïve to your gang

But where do you think the tips come from

That guarantee a solid payday


I am Mr. Munnee

The silent partner who you cut in

But we can never speak of this

Not to anyone ever again


Death is now

Your only escape

I will continue my end

And we'll never speak of this day


I'll be back tomorrow

And our arrangement won't change

I'm your odd friend

Ignorant of your gang


Tomorrow is Italian

I'll find something good

Maybe Artisan pizza

I guess it depends on the mood


So I'll see you then

Now I must leave

Get Charlie's size

And take the expenses from me


I'll cover his funeral

As I'd cover for y'all

I don't want to go that route

But that's not really my call


If the mouth stays shut

Then I see no problem

But if loose lips open

Then I nust close them


If we understand each other

Then this matter is finished

I'll see y'all tomorrow

I hope y'all like Guinness
