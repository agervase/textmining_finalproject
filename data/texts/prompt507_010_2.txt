The blood running down H-143’s knee was unmistakable.

We’d been in our back garden, playing football together. We’d been tackling each other, taking turns to shoot at an empty goal, that sort of thing. I’d got him with a sliding tackle and tripped him by mistake. 

And now, he was bleeding. H-143 - my artificial little brother, my 5th Birthday present - was bleeding.

‘Are - are you alright?’ I said.

‘Yeah. Fine,’ he said. He was sitting up, trying to cover up the blood with his hands. ‘This is nothing. Don’t worry about it.’

‘Um, bro?’ I said. ‘Is that blood?’ 

’N-no, of course not. It’s…I dunno. It’s not blood.’

It was blood. Any idiot could see that it was blood.

Androids didn’t have blood. Androids didn’t bleed when cut.

‘Hey, uh, I’m going to go in, okay?’ my brother said. ‘To get this fixed. You know?’

‘Want me to come with-‘

‘Oh, no, I’ll be fine. I’m fine.’ He got up, and hurriedly hobbled off towards our house. 

Which me all alone with my thoughts, and my questions.

He’d been bleeding; there was no doubt about that. And if he’d been bleeding, that meant he was human. And if was human, then he wasn’t…I wasn’t…

I raised my right arm, and let my eyes take in the unblemished skin. It all looked so perfect, so smooth, so…human. 

Because I was human too. Wasn’t I?

I took my left index finger and pressed it firmly into my arm. I swallowed, hesitating for just a single instant, and then drew it hard down my skin. I drew it slowly, pressing down harder and harder, ignoring the pain until, finally, my skin split open.

And there was no blood. Of course there was no blood.

Because I wasn’t human, was I?

I heard my family then: H-143 - my little brother - and Mom and Dad too. They were all running up to me, calling my name. 

And as they ran, I stood still and wondered faintly: was that even my real name name, or was that a lie as well?
