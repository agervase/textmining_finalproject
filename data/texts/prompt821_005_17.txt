“Exercist,” it read on Gabe’s license. Certified by the Brope himself. A small piece of ash darkened his otherwise angelically pristine certificate. He spit on his finger and rubbed it up, down, left, right.

“Ahem.” An unearthly voice came from behind him.

“I thought I told you not to do that,” Gabe turned around and glared at the hellspawn, “All this transdimensional warping is why you’re all so fat.”

“But, I was going to be late.” The demon’s chins frowned. He was one of those typical red ones, if it had eaten all the other red ones and then asked for seconds. Then thirds. Then fourths. Currently, the folds of his body were eating Gabe’s couch.

“You could’ve at least teleported outside and took the stairs. Besides I thought demons liked being late.”

“We do. Unless we’re being charged by the hour for it.” He pointed his tail at the clock. It was frozen at 6:66. The demon
laughed.

“Thank you! It’s actually pefect that you stopped the clock, because that gives us an eternity for you to run off all that fat on the treadmill.” Gabe, looked back at the clock. Suddenly it was back to normal. That line always worked.

The demon pulled a crumpled pile of whirling white mass from the abyss under his middle tit. It screamed and howled as he dropped it on the desk. “Payment for today’s session.”

Gabe pointed to a sign on his desk, “NO SOULS.” 

“But, these aren’t typical souls. They were very hard to come by. Very dark.”

“Yeah, I’m sure my landlord will be thrilled when I try to hand him this for rent. C’mon cough up the cash, I’m sure you ate some on the way here.”

The demon snarled, “I will not be treated like this by a mere mortal.” The demon tried to stand, but collapsed under his own weight.

“Listen Beelzeboobs, how about instead of getting revenge on me you get vegeance on that waistline?”

The demon nodded.

“Don’t worry, I’ve got a very special program set up for you. PPL. Push, Pull, Lucifer.”
