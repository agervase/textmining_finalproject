My name is Lucas, I’m son of Arbora who saved the world countless times. I don’t like living in big cities like most humans do. My father gave me a spell book that is capable of finding magic items all over the universe. That was 20 years ago.

I have decided to give away these useless things to a strangers. I was doing okay before I collected these items now I'm carrying a hidden curse wherever I go.

Stranger asked me,

''What is that thing on your back?''

''It just a sword’' I answered.

''Why would you need a sword...''

''Do you want to hold it?''

He was really surprised when I offered the sword. 

''I don’t know. Is it heavy?''

I gave the sword to him. As soon as he got a grip of the sword he started screaming.

 ''It’s sucking my blood.''

''Oh no, you need to calm down so it can finish it quicker.''

''WHAT?!''

''Just breath. It is trying to understand whether or not you are worthy.''

Second stanger noticed my bracer and I gave it to him.

He was surrounded by a big shell afterwards. He was trying to tell me something but I couldn’t hear him clear enough to understand him.

Then, my boots activated itself and I started run really fast. To be honest, I had enough with this boots. One day, I had to ditch the girl I like because of this cursed boots.

Third stranger was dazzled by these boots. One second he was standing right in front of me other second he was already hundreds of meters away from me.

Suddenly I had the tingly feeling on my chest. I checked my jacket's pocket and my spell book was gone. Probably, it knew what was going to happen...
