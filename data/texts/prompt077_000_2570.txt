A lightning storm manifested from seemingly nowhere as Jack got out of his car and loomed over the crushed and broken man he'd just slammed into. 

A bolt of lightning struck nearby. Then another, and another. The overwhelming smell of ozone filled the air. Finally, the largest lightning bolt yet slammed down from the heaven's and struck Jack. Power surged through him, as the lights of his car exploded, his phone flew from his hand and blew up, and the nearby electrical wires began to rain down sparks before snapping in two and swinging down to the forest below. 

Overcome by sheer power, a voice as if God himself, spoke in Jack's head.

> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES

The lightning died down, Jack fell to the ground covered in sweat, hands on the warm asphalt, the dead man laying beside him and, suddenly, Jack knew how to install a gray water system in a late 19th century Victorian house. Or change the drainage catch on a split level. For months there had been a leak in the toilet on the second floor of Jack's mother in law's house, and now, sitting there on the highway, Jack knew that the problem was a simple gasket that had worn down and that he could fix it for under a dollar. 

"Holy shit," Jack said to the empty street and the dead man and himself, "I'm a plumber!" 

Jack needed to be sure. He scrambled over to the contorted dead man and began rummaging through his blood-stained pockets until he found a wallet, which he flung open and searched for an ID. There was a driver's license and on it a name. Jack Wallace. 

"See you Jack," Jack said, and then took out his list and crossed off another name. There was only one Jack left in this zipcode.

Jack got back in his car and drove over to the last address. 

He arrived as the sun was coming up, his small pistol hidden away in the inside pocket of his jacket. It was a small, one-story house. As he circled the home, casing it, Jack noted that the drainage pipe in the backyard was three meters short of regulation. He also saw that one of the back windows was wide open. It had been a hot night and there was not a lot of crime in these parts. 

So Jack walked right up to the house and climbed inside. 

Once in the home Jack pulled his pistol and wiped beading sweat off his forehead. He realized he was very tired - how many hours ago had he killed Jack Wallace on the highway and taken his knowledge? When had he last slept? 

But nevermind all that, it was only the hunt that mattered. If he was right, this Jack, Jack Warner, was an auto mechanic, which would be a much-needed skill given the amount of time Jack spent on the road, hunting and killing other Jacks. 

Jack stalked through the hallway of Jack Warner's small home, opening doors slowly, pistol up and ready. He walked through the thin house, opening each door until at last, he came to a final room. It had to be the bedroom. Eager, tired, Jack turned the doorknob and gave the door a push. 

Jack heard the click before he saw the shotgun suspended from the ceiling. Then came the deafening blast of the shotgun's discharge and the buckshot took Jack hard in the chest. 

Eyes wide, back flat on the carpeted floor, Jack could feel his lungs filling up with blood. He struggled to get up, but could not get his feet under him. Someone walked out of the bedroom and kicked the small pistol out of Jacks limp hand, and stood over Jack, looking down at him appraisingly.

"Bagged me another one, I guess." Without any regard for Jack's desperate writhing and gurgling, Jack Warner bent down and began rummaging through Jack's pockets. He found Jack's wallet, opened it up, looked at the driver's license, and clicked his tongue against his front teeth. "Yep." Then he gave Jack a disappointed look and shook his head at him. "Thought you could sneak up on me unawares, huh? Big mistake, and not the first time neither." 

Jack's mouth was opening and closing like a dying fish as he tried to say something with his last breath. He could taste hot iron on his tongue.

Jack Warner saw Jack was trying to say something, and so he bent down low and placed his ear to Jack's mouth.

Wetly, Jack managed the words, his bloody hand reaching up and holding on to Jack Warner's shoulder for dear life.

"There. . . can. . .be . . . only. . .one... "

Jack's hand went limp, the light left his eyes, and he passed right there on Jack Warner's carpet. 

Jack Warner for his part, nodded solemnly. "Don't I know it, brother." 

Then he ran out into the back yard as quick as he could so that the lightning wouldn't start a fire in his house. He made it just in time, as a lightning storm coalesced above him. Bolts of blue electricity struck the ground in several places first, and then hit Jack right on the head, coursing pure energy through his veins. A voice, as of God, said to him:

>THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE JACK OF ALL TRADES.

And then the storm was gone, and Jack fell to the ground. In the aftermath, he took a deep breath of the hot summer air and reveled in his new found knowledge. Slowly, he got up to his feet and started back inside to take care of the body.

As he walked in through the back door, Jack's gaze fell on the drainage pipe leading from the back of his house. He realized, for the first time ever, that it was three meters under regulation. 

"I'll be damned," he said, smiling to himself, "I'm a goddamned plumber."
