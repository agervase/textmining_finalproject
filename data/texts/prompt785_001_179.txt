A boy, no older than seven summers, sat under the massive shadow of his house. A contemplative look crossing his face with his hand rubbing his chin like his father was wont to do when thinking. Tilting his head, critical thinking of legendary proportions was taking place.

*Hmm* 

*Hmm*

He continuously repeated those sounds. His brain working to fast to notice what he was doing or how his parents looked awkwardly towards him.
Though sweet smiles adorned their face at seeing their cute child act so adorable, it was still quite worrying that he would spend time thinking like an old man instead of going out to play.

But of course, little Johnny did not notice any of that.

"Dragons love to eat fishies," said Johnny in a whistful murmer. Having once seen a dragon dive into the lake near his home, he had to assume they loved fishes; or fishies as he often called them.

"Dragons love to lazy in the sun," said Johnny, a cute frown on his face. His father had warned him about being lazy, but Biggest Bluey was always being lazy.

"Dragons have fun tails," said Johnny, giggling adorably. He remembered when he kept poking Baby Bluey. Her tail was always *swooshing* and *swishing* and even sometimes *woshing!* 

Thinking even harder, eyes furrowed and lips narrowed, little Johnny could only come to one conclusion. This would shake the world in its entirety, or so he believed. And like the great adventurer he was, he was the first to discover it!

Laughing out loud, startling his mom to dropping a plate and his father to slam the hammer onto his finger, little Johnny ran around the yard with his usual endless energy. For a few minutes, he kept on running having discovered something amazing.

Finding his parents on the stairs staring at him, he rushed to them to explain.

In deep breathes, Johnny pulled at his mother's dress, laughing maddly.

"Ma! Ma! Dragons are cats!!!"
