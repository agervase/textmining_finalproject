Thrilled with my newfound strength, I hopped across parked cars, climbed on top of my house, and shouted for joy as I tested my limits. It was exhilarating. At least until cops tazed and beat me in the street after I pretended to be a karate master and accidentally caved in a car charger on the street.  


But that's not why I'm in jail right now. My lawyer's finally here, after what seemed like days. I can't tell in here anyway. The police have had little contact with me since I was booked. At least I'm about to get out of here.  


"Ms. Stevens, I'm going to be frank with you," the lawyer said while hunching down into a chair. "You're in some deep trouble."  


"Look, I already tried to tell the cops that I'll pay the fine. I know vandalism's not taken lightly in the city but I-"  
"It's not about the charger. In fact, you're not even being charged with vandalism or destruction of property or anything."  
"Then why am I in here?"  
"Because they have evidence that you've committed consumption."  


I took a minute to jolt myself back to awareness. What he just said dumbfounded me.   


"If they think I'm on drugs, then these cops are dead wrong."  
The lawyer quickly replied, "I wish I could spin it otherwise, kid, but yeah you are." He took out a worn tablet from his bag and set it on the table, scrolling through to my case files. "Says here you tested positive for huge levels of carbohydrates. Now of course, it's normal to have that in your body, but for the spike like that to happen, their lab's tellin' them you had to have gotten them externally." He put the tablet aside. "But it doesn't matter because you're gonna walk outta here with my help."  


The jar. Consumption. I know what he means now. Those weird dusty fruits in Alyce's grandma's basement were what made me all energized, and the law has something against it. But what?
