The machine had been my life.

I worked on it for as long as I can remember. Even when I was a child, I wondered what things were made of. Once I knew, I wondered what /those/ things were made of, and so on. It was  my life's work.

I was not prepared to see a face.

A young girl, squinting into a light, bright purple grass beneath her. She had thick, spiraling antlers, and bright freckles spotted her body. She was frowning, looking into the light, and then turned to follow some unseen object.

Looking back, I should have fallen out of my chair. I should have panicked, and wondered if it was a prank. But I didn't. I just...I just understood. 

This girl I'd found was nothing. She was a speck on a planet that was a speck in a galaxy that was a speck on a tomato I'd grown in my wife's garden.  But she was alive, very clearly, vibrantly alive, and so was I. What speck was my galaxy on? Who built the machine that peered down on me?

I knew, breathing slowly, that I could tell no one. Imagine the outcry, learning that every bite of everything you ever ate contained trillions, quintillions, an infinity of intelligent life? The world would come to a standstill. There would be riots.

No one alive would comprehend the machine, but it was easy to operate. I had to destroy it. I took a wrench and slowly, remembering the face of that alien girl with every step and movement, disassembled it. I wiped all the schematics. I burned notes. I melted intricate gears. 

I wondered how many worlds I was crushing as I pressed the cold steel against the top of my mouth. I wondered what would happen to the girl with the antlers on my tomato. I wondered what would happen to me.

I pulled the trigger.
