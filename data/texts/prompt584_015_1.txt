“Ya see this little guy? Dude helps me get what I want when making deals.” Said the man in the bandana, sitting behind the table of items of various illegality. Bandana holds out a small black dragon, about the size of his palm, sitting down on the cloth of his fingerless gloves. The Director stands with his arms crossed with a bit of a smirk.

“I know what ya thinkin’: ‘how can this small thing really make things happen?” Bandana says, moving his head to eye the entire film crew. “It comes down to Lil’ Ferno, that’s his name, being a really good hider.”

Bandana turns his attention to Lil’ Ferno and delicately pets the back of his neck with a finger.

“See, them playas out there always searchin’ ya when the product is being negotiated. They check all the usual spots for them OG blasters fools still usin’. I got in on the game early, and it has been worth my while.” Bandana says, turning to gesture around the whole room, a basement room with reinforced walls and windows for bullet resistance, filled with more items of different illegality. “An’ways, Lil’ Ferno can hide in a lot of places they don’t check or even think to check.”

Bandana starts to reach his other hand towards his feet but stops and returns back to his relaxed recline.

“I probably shouldn’t show ya’ll all my methods.” The man says tilting head to one side with a smug look in his hazel eyes. “What that sayin’ ‘bout magicians?”

The Director shakes his head with a grin.

Bandana holds Lil’ Ferno closer to him with the side of his hand up against his chest.

“For a small dragon, he got a big voice, ya feel me?”

“What about that guy back there? What’s he good for?” asks The Director, pointing towards the dark corner of the room where another larger dragon sleeps in a large dog bed, covered entirely in a blanket with cartoon dragons printed all over.

“Oh yeah, that’s Delfuego. I’m surprised the dude can sleep with all the noise we doin’ now. We don’t even have a washing machine in this building because he hates the sound.” Bandana says while turning to look at the cloth covered lump in the corner. “That probably why he got the blanket over his head cause of these lights.”

Bandana leans in a bit more towards the bed from his chair and asks: “You up, Del?”

The dragon slowly wriggles to move the blanket off his head, revealing his green sheen. 

“’Ey, c’mon over here. These guys wanna see ya.” Bandana says softly, gesturing towards his side.

Delfuego stands up and steps out of the bed, dragging the blanket along with him. He looks back at the blanket and whips his wings around until it falls off his body.

Bandana and the film crew quietly chuckle at this sight. The man turns back and displays a happy look at the camera.

“That’s my boy!” Bandana says, before turning back to see that Delfuego has sat next to his chair, staring up at him.

The green dragon’s gold adornments glimmer, now being in the direction of the film crew’s tungsten lights.

The Director stands with a slightly impressed expression.

“I didn’t even notice that.” He says, shaking his head with a soft chuckle.

Bandana turns towards The Director and asks, “What’s good?”

The Director looks towards Bandana and says “Oh, the…uh…bling you got on your dragon there.”

Bandana turns toward Delfuego and lightly taps the gold rings that sit at the base of his horns.

“Yeah, I knew he was missing something when I first got him. He’s a lot happier with the bling. Must be some kinda primal urge type thing going on.”

Bandana turns toward Lil’ Ferno, who looks at him upset with only a little bit of his golden-yellow eyes showing.

“This one is due to get some bling too, I just gotta get it custom made. I got Delfuego a gold chain to wear when we roll out in my ‘vert ‘Maro, but he isn’t real tight wit’ it.”

The Director sits down in a folding movie chair with his name on the back and looks at Bandana.

“So, what do you use…uh…Delfuego for?” He asks, bouncing his eyes between the green dragon and the pale criminal.

“Oh, sorry ‘bout that. Like I said, when I go out to the usual spots or just when I want to let my ‘Maro loose, Delfuego sits in the passenger seat in case anything goes down. He got some range for his size. I won’t even see the target when he fires, it’s just all flame.”

The Director tilts his head a bit, showing some concern.

“How often do you have to…you know…?”

Bandana shakes his head sternly.

“Not often, fam. I keep him and Lil’ Ferno around for the security, but also they make for good company. I’ll have to show you the rest of the squad soon. You definitely have to meet Sol.”

“How big is Sol?” asked The Director.

Bandana chuckles.

“He ain’t fitting in this room or any of the other rooms in this house.”

The film crew looks at each other in muted amazement.

The Director crossed his arms with a focused look.

“So, what got you into all this, to having all these dragons?”

Bandana stares at the floor.

“I like to think that I made an ‘interesting’ mix of mistakes and successes throughout my life. That’s what got me here. Like…I don’t wear this bandana just to protect my identity.” He says, looking back up at The Director. “I’m sorry if that isn’t a lot of detail, the beginning is a blur for me. I’d have to get my story straight to let you know more.”

The Director sits up in his chair.

“No, that’s fine. We have plenty of time to get the stuff we need for this doc. We’ll schedule when it’s convenient for you.”

“Sounds good, fam. You guys have been great to have here. Any of you want to meet this part of the dragon squad?” Bandana says, pointing his hand individually to the film crew.

The Director leans his chin against his fist with an amused look.

“Yeah, that would definitely make for some good B-roll.”

**Not sure how well this fit the prompt or the general theme, but this scenario came to mind and I just thought to roll with it. It was fun to write.**
