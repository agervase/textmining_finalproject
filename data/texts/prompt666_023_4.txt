This is new. This is weird. It's so out of the ordinary, that I don't know what to make of it. C'then and I don't know how to enterpit this, is it really from the other side? The dig of Faltwa Canyon has us all stumped. This could either be ground-breaking to our current research and change everything we know, or it could be something entirely new itself. I'm afraid what this could imply.


**Entry 2** 

C'then told me he has heard rumors that he didn't at first believe from down south. He said that someone had found similar relics AND that they'd been acting strangely. The relics, that is. Yes, some sort of mechanical device that they'd never encountered before. C' didn't give it much credit back when he heard of it, but now that we've found similar devices, he and I don't know what to do with it. Or how to deal.


**Entry 3** 

I'm so confused. Where does this come from? Did the Othera suddenly advance by several rotations, or have we just completely missed this on the last pass? Yes the landscape changes drastically, but our methods have changed in a ccordance and so have theirs - but this? This doesn't belong anywhere.

Further investigation into the relics revealed that some of them can be activated, even without being connected to a power source. Some of them glow and eerie purple light and have dials with strange symbols, unknown to our translators. It's completely foreign to them as well and they're frightned.

Hanz, that religious idiot, thinks that the Othera have invented magic. That these items are weapons, left behind for us to use to destroy ourselves. I don't know what they are, but now I'm hesitant to study them as well.


**Entry 4** 

Astounding, and quite troubling developments, on the study of the relics. I'm afraid to admit that they could potentially be weapons. C' got wounded, trying to open up a loose plate on one of the active devices. Turns out it's a trigger of sorts, and that the plate belongs to what could be a handle or grip, to what I think is a very large projectile handweapon. A gun, of unfathomable power.

C' is missing a large chunk of himself. Whatever the projectile was, it disintegrated a hole through him and cauterized the lining. It only affects organic compounds and his clothes is untouched. The doctor isn't sure he'll be able to regrow the hole, as it's too large and already cauterized. Had it hit him more to the right, his internal organs would have been struck and he could be dead.

These are all troubling discoveries. I'm afraid of what we'll find next. We're coming up on the Hez'la shores soon..


**Entry 5** 

More of these weapons are showing up as we turn the earth. The diggers are calling for their immediate destruction, as we have more casualties of their destructive capabilities. We've found other types too; massive contraptions, capabilities to fire a continuous stream of projectiles.. or particles, as others would call it. Others work as explosives, and we've learned that the hard way.

Regardless, they've split the waters and controversey are starting to arise. Some think we should use these to defend ourselves, for obviously the other side have turned hostile. Others, think we should study, larn and utilize this technology for our own advancement.

We know the Othera are builders, and like to erect housing constantly. We see their structural remains all the time, this is what we study. But why do they leave so much behind in the desert for us to find all of a sudden? We've always only found scraps and now, we find entire arsenals of weaponry. It doesn't sit right with me.


**Entry 6** 

The outermost Walkers are coming up to the the shores of Hez'la and the northern throng is splitting up from the south again. We'll see them again when both shores converge again. The northern throng is condensing to follow the shore and we'll be seeing the abandoned settlements of Arejada and what the Othera's have left for us this rotation any time soon.

The departure ceremony is about to start. I'll be back in next year.


**Entry 7** 

We've encountered what used to be Arejada.. used to, being the key phrase. It's completely demolished and there's clear signs of fighting this time. There's been used more conventional weapons as well, as we've found fragments of weaponry that is much like our own. For the first time we're sure that all the leveled buildings are destroyed by hand, not by weather. 

Have they been infighting? Have they split into smaller clans and fought? Over what? Why is there still this divide in technology?

We keep finding highly technological weaponry, and now also other relics that we've yet found the function of. None of it fits in with what we know of the Othera's technological provess. 

We'll continue scouring the region around Arejada for clues as we always do, but will there be anything new from the Othera's as we pass through the next time?


**Entry 8** 

We've found craters, massive craters. We've found more ordinance and we have found, for the first time, vessels made of metals we've never seen before. Huge vessels, seemingly once flying machines. How anything could fly above the Ebeophere with those troubled winds is astounding, but perhaps that's why they're wrecks now. Many have battle scars, bullet holes made from familiar weaponry. We're looking at a battlefield, and there are missing pieces everywhere.

Where's all the bodies? For the past 38 excavations we've not found a single body, bone or grave. 

We had to get rid of Hanz. His religious fanaticism regarding the apocalypse was getting to us, and it's spreading. Most of the Wanderment is gossiping about it and many fears for the future. We've started seeing tendencies of people harboring their own relics and I'm afraid it's not out of amazement that they keep them. Trouble arises.


**Entry 9** 

I'm working on a theory. I've not yet told anyone about it.
From the pieces I've been able to put together, I'm afraid that the Othera have been wiped out or taken by aliens. Yes, aliens. I know how crazy that sounds. But there's no other explanation for the jump in technologically advanced items that we've uncovered in the sand. The vessels that we found shot to pieces are not of Otheran design. And from the examinations that I've done, very components thereof are from any origin on this planet. They could only come from off planet.

I don't know really. It's all been so troubling. The more we wander, the more we see the destruction ahead of us. Their cities, brought to crumbling ruin, where on other passes we've been seeing greetings and the occational caches of ritches left for us from the Othera. Now, all we meet is death. 


**Entry 10**

We've found bones. They're not Otheran. This changes everything.

I suspect, that they've been caught in the sun for too long and it killed .. whatever they are. Huge, grotesque bones, corpses twice the size of us. The bones are super resillient, but burnt black by the sun. We found them in the midsts of more of their armory. It's definitive proof.

I'm thrilled and I'm terrified. What's next?

I theorize, (wildly) ... alien raiders?
