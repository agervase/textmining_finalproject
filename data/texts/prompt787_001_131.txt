"O father in water, boiled be thy noodle, thy kingdom come, thy sauce be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us this day our garlic bread and forgive us our indulgences, as we forgive those who indulge on our food. And deliver us not into vegetables, but lead us into carbohydrates. For the meatball, the strainer and the sauce are yours, forever and ever, r'amen." As I finished my prayer, a thunderous crackle echoed down the street, sending a shockwave nearly knocking the strainer off my head. I walked outside to see all my neighbors standing on their lawns, jaws open as they stared down the street towards the heavenly figure above. "Foolish mortals!" The being laughed, "for years you have disregarded my teachings, mocked my followers, but no more. Now you shall feel the wrath of the flying spaghetti monster." I couldn't believe what I heard. I was right! This entire time I was right! As our saviour appeared in his true, glorious form, I fell to my knees. His eyes scanned up and down the street of confused onlookers, finally stopping at me. "You," his mighty voice shook the houses, "you are one of the holy few." I was speechless as his noodley appendage reached out and grabbed me, pulling me towards him. He held me close so I could see his glorious form. "You will come with me to the holy land," his voice boomed, "the rest of these fools will boil for their sins." I took one last look at the world I was leaving behind as our saviour pulled me up into the heavens. I saw the infidels boil, and felt my purpose in life was finally fulfilled. I woke up from my bed laying in a pool of sweat. "Are you okay honey, you seemed to be having a nightmare." My mother yelled from downstairs. Impossible. I was deceived. No matter, I would keep waiting until his glorious arrival for the rest of my life if I had to. Then they'll see.
