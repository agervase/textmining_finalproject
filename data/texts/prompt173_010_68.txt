Humanity.

A weird species.

Instead of opting for an optimal utopian government made of people who have passed standard intelligent tests, they decided to let the people vote despite how bad the choice is.

Now, about war. Humans are supposed to be a subspecies of a warring race that we planted on this planet years ago, but yet, they’ve become... weird.
 
War happens a lot. Humanity’s incredible capacity of inhuman cruelty far exceeds almost every species on the list. They engineered and devised weapons that is efficient for one specific job, taking life, especially of their own. Swords, guns, grenades, tanks, poison gas, and atomic bombs. These devices were engineered just to slaughter their own species. 

Yet it seems we overlooked one thing.

It’s the one thing keeping the humans from going mindless. Something that rivals the incredible capacity they have for cruelty.

And it’s their incredible capacity they have for kindness.

Despite the corporates trying to take over. Despite the allure of taking over and dominating, these humans are also capable of diplomatic relationships, of altruistic behaviors towards their own species. Among the numerous villains throughout history, there were countless heroes who shows an endless capacity of kindness towards their own species despite the morbid situations.

There was ghandi, Who despite getting abused, fought a peaceful war and wish to end things without bloodshed.

There was Martin Luther King, who died a hero for the war he fought for peace despite getting jailed and abused.

In fact, even the warring type holds this capacity for kindness.

Nazi soldiers who secretly let people go free. Killers who care more about their sons then their well beings. And bullies who turned themselves and decide to be kind.

Humanity shall and always will be one of the cruelest species in the galaxy, but will also be the kindest species who fought for peace.
