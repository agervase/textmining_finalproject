*I see you are still terrified of me, Brian.*

The words did feel warm in my mind, I admit, but I still felt no place for them. 

*Yes,* I thought, as Bul'grum lowered herself down in front of me. With a body the size of a catcher's mitt, it was hard to imagine the thin thread shot from her spinneret was keeping her up, but there she was, all 8 eyes transfixed on me. 

*But soon you will understand how special you are to me.* 

*Mm-hmm.* I thought politely. 

*You resist, but I know you feel my warmth. I love you, Brian. Please do not leave.* 

I placed the neatly wrapped food parcel at my feet, never taking my eyes off her. I nodded slightly and walked out, still not fully turning around. 

*See you tomorrow Brian.* 

I half-shuddered. I mean she wouldn't be so bad if she weren't an unholy arachnid. Her voice is sexy as hell.

The witch was 5th-dimensional today and I was having none of it. When she did appear, it was only in a distant part of my memory, and only then for a second- no sooner had I retrieved the thought than she would be gone again. I sprayed neutrino nutrition liberally and threw the can on the ground, and I took great satisfaction in the harsh, echoing clatter. Fuck this. 

It was much warmer and calmer in the hallway than in the witch's room, and I relaxed. Hopefully Shogg-Lu'um was in a good mood. 

Opening the door to his room felt like opening the door to an airplane at 10,000 feet. It was an insultingly large room, made possible by taking spacetime and bending it over a barrel, and inhabited by what I imagined was a pretty cool dude, actually. 

Just a distant rumble, somewhere beyond the great stacks of clouds produced by this room's weather system. The wall behind me stretched up and in both directions in a way I found pretty nauseating, so I mostly just kept my eyes on the delicate cherry wood kitchen table and chair set about 40 yards away. It had appeared one day, much to my delight, along with a game set up on it. It was usually Sorry! Today it was Parcheesi. 

The rumble now again, much closer. The air changed and I felt a charge in it, the way you feel before lightning strikes except it never stops. It always makes my heart beat a little funny and sometimes i think I can feel myself being taken apart and put back together but not always right. Important part here is not to look up not in his general direction. That's what the nice little table and chairs and game are for, something to focus on.

When Shogg finally arrived, I instantly urinated myself as usual and he was gracious enough to remove the mess, and then took the liberty of removing all of the stuff getting ready for load-out, straight out of my guts, because he thinks humans hate feces but doesn't get that the act itself can be very relieving. I sincerely hate it when he does that. 

I put his newspaper in the empty chair across from me. I put a red piece (don't choose blue, that's his favorite) in the starting location and rolled no fives in any combination. It was his turn to roll the dice, and he did this time-dilation thing that he knows fucks with me. The two dice lifted into the air, briefly stretched to infinity, then landed, each one showing '2.5'. Gingerly, a blue piece lifted and made its move, and it landed at such an angle that it spun round and round, faster and faster until it achieved an almost piercing tone. It stopped. 

I pulled out a chair and sat down, sighing. It was going to be one of *those* days.
