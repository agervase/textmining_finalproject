Every town, every land... it brims with its own language. Its only little quirks its own little cultural norms. This was true of magic. The Ether that coursed through each land responded to different sounds. It was only natural that music became the center point of all magic. You could learn a lot about a mage from the cants they recited. You could learn even more about a land from hearing their mages' cant. There was once a tradition in this country, one that I was once intimately familiar with. Spells were crafted not around the speed of casting, but quality of the cast. Mages with reedy voices were torn asunder. All it took was a burning coal to the throat to destroy a mage's career.


Those must have been interesting times.


Such tradition was now reserved only for those who could afford the most valuable of all currency- time. Now, spells needed to be weaved quicker than the ear could perceive. That was why, if you wanted to see the way of the land, you needed to find a proper mage's arena.


In this land, Floria, the best arenas lay underground. What were once the catacombs of a long-lost dynasty now lay profaned by the smell of hedonism and despair. If I were a better poet, perhaps I could weave a tragedy from these rotten bones. The massive cave dipped at the center- where once lay an oppulent casket was now an open field. I pushed through the crowd that surrounded it, hundred cramped in the darkest pit of the land about a duel. To my left stood a man, his body large and laden with belts. Glints of false gold managed to pierce through the dim lighting. To his right stood his familiar. I once heard it claimed that familiars were used to channel the ether. But now, they served a decidedly more... direct purpose. The wolf-like familiar howled, before tapping its claws against the ground. It swayed its tail, and began to blow into the trumpet that hovered before it. Its keys contracted and popped as it began to set a beat, the room quieting to hear the spellster spin his weave.


*"Straight from the underground, I come here a-rappin'*
*"Shut the fuck up before I give you a slappin'*
*"Yo' ass lookin' fine why don't you sweep over here,*
*"And you can leave the ring with a whoopin' of yo' rear!"*


With a flick of his wrist, I could see the tendrils of ether warp the air. A telekinetic spell to start, not bad, it he were playing the amateur part. He was aiming to drag his opponent forward, but his words were more for the sake of entertainment than the casting. His opponent, however seemed more refined. Her familiar was a fairy- poor luck that, considering its tiny lungs- but her stance befit a proper stage more than this pit. In fact, she seemed even more out of place, as she began to spin her own rhyme.


*"Heart of ice,*
*"Beneath the vice*
*"Pierce the skin*
*"Spread so thin*
*"Cross specious words*
*"Coil 'bout the spinerettes*
*"Burst forth towards*
*"The vile victim of tourettes!"*


Her opponent's face twitched in a wayward spasm as from the air about her spun circular pockets. The temperature dropped as ice rocketed forward, hurtling through the air they soared at the belt-covered man. He began to dodge, but he seemed to miss the part where she informed the bullets of ice to track him. He realized this a moment in, signalling his instrumentation to resume.


"*Groundrock rise up*
"*We best skip the warm up*
"*Come on bitch do you worst,*
"*Cuz I got a wall of earthern crust!"*


From the ground sprang forth a wall of rock. The crowd began to cheer as they expected the duel to continue... clearly the audience was inexperienced. The girl's words were far more practical than hurtful. First, she had commanded the ice to be hard as the heart of an iceberg- it was a reference to an ancient spell ice sculpters used to form the basis of their art. Then, skipping past her lines intended to insult the opponent, she had commanded the ice to coil about a spinerette that rocketed towards her target.


In other words, the man had attempted form a wall of rock to defend himself from drills of ice.


He shouted his surrender after the first two drills shot through this shield.
