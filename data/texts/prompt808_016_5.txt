*Do you want to watch tv and eat junk food? Yes you do, yes you do, who's a good human, who's a good human. 

# I am but please don't talk to me that way, I am not a pet I am a human for God sakes, I am at the top of the food the chain, I am sick and tired of you robots always undermining us we created you. 

* of course silly thing, you created all of us, little cutie, you're the best of the... 

# STOP TALKING TO ME IN THAT WAY GOD DAMMIT. 


* someone is in a bad mood today, ok honey I am going to make a 2 minutes pizza all just for you and I am going to put your favorite tv show on so you don't fell alone while mommy goes to the store ok. 

This happened every day for as long as my parents remember but not my grandparents they resisted off course they were put to sleep that's what they do, they treat us the same way the oldest used to treat their pets. 

Haven't seen Mike in a couple of weeks rumors has it he was taken away to a shelter after he refused to answer a human control official in the park, he's probably going to be put down he was always a rebel and a rude refusing to ever obey his owner, unit 6553721 will have a new human in a couple of days she will buy a pure bred Caucasian probably a young one, she loves them when they are kids and quickly loses her love when they hit puberty. 

Mine is a little better she seems to care for me maybe even love me but I hate the way she talks to me, give a little respect please. She takes me out buys me everything that comes out in the latest trend of clothes for humans, the expensive toys, she even allows me to have play dates with other humans of the neighborhood. 

I am not the best behaved human, 6553721 say it's because I am not properly trained and wasn't spayed on time, but I like to think that maybe it's a little pride left hasn't been breed out of my family line, I am not violent like I've seen other humans be I just want a little respect nothing more. 

* mommy is back baby, and I have a big surprise for you. 

# what is it? 

* it's a vintage denim jacket with phresh written on the one arm and tons of shiny things in the other come try it on. 

# it will not fit me. 

* yes it will, come on just try it on. 

# ok ok give it....... See it doesn't close I can button it up 

* but that's the way the cool humans wear it. 

This is everyday living I guess, day in day out until I die and she gets a new human.
