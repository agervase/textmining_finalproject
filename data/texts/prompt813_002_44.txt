Everything in Jason’s life had seemed so incredibly lucky up until now. Born to a wealthy family and educated at the finest college in the West Coast, all the things Jason touched seemed to turn to gold. He had worked incredibly hard, pulling 100 hour weeks and sleeping in his car to push his first startup to success. Using the money from the acquisition, he quickly moved onto his true passion: virtual reality. He hired the most brilliant minds on the planet to push the technology forward, while also constantly pushing himself to be a better leader. He ate well, exercised constantly, and disciplined his mind to keep learning continuously.

In a rare moment of free time, he found himself relaxing over beers with a few close friends. They were intently discussing the implications of the new virtual reality technology; science, education, and entertainment the likes of which had never been seen before. Suddenly, Jason was struck with an even better idea. He realized that this new technology could shape the fabric of society, lifting up people to their highest potential. The idea was simple; using the new neural interface, you could immerse an individual in false memories and overwrite their personality, allowing them to fully experience life as another human. You could live the life of a successful person in the past, and emerge with their habits, worldview and knowledge once you were done. Jason was just about to excitedly explain this idea to his friends when the world suddenly froze. His mind grew hazy as a translucent window appeared in the center of his vision, following his gaze as his eyes darted around.

Jason’s mind swam. Was his name really Jason at all? All his memories seemed plastic, incomplete; he couldn’t even remember how they had arrived at the bar he was at, or even the last names of any of the friends he was hanging out with. His head pounded and waves of nausea washed over him, as foreign memories beat their way back into his skull. He wasn’t a successful entrepreneur, but a robotics facility inspector, a glorified janitor barely scraping by. Could he afford 1999 credits? How much had he already spent in this machine? All that time spent working out and meditating was for nothing, and all his knowledge of programming was now incomprehensible, as if waking up from a dream. He breathed heavy, feeling the weight of the metal headset on his head and the hum of the electrodes on his scalp. Hands trembling, he pressed his thumb against the side of the headset.
