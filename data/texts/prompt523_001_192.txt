"Shakira; how could you have known?" Malcolm, my roommate, said seemingly out of nowhere, and completely unprompted.

"What are you talking about?" I disinterestedly gazed up from my laptop, to find Malcolm walking over with several sheets of paper in his hands.

"You know that Shakira song, 'Hips Don't Lie', right?" He said, setting the papers down on the coffee table.

"Everybody and their brother knows that song."

"They don't- you don't...not really." He shows me some sheet music, "Here I have the complete sheet music for the song. I realized that Shakira's music video has the wrong dance tempo."

"Uh huh, sure. Just how long have you been watching the music video on repeat and watching Shakira shake her hips? Because I think you might have a problem Mal."

"I'm serious! There is a distinct pattern of long and short sways and swings that she does that aren't synced to the music!"

"Are you saying Shakira is a bad dancer, or that the music video is edited poorly?"

"I'm saying she's dancing in Morse Code."

"Okaaaaaaaay. What exactly are...and I cannot believe I am even entertaining this, what are her hips saying then?"

"She predicted, the KFC Double Down, and that Hurricane Harvey would be a disasterâ€”among other things."

"Really, no shit?"

"Yeah, and when I sync up the code with the music I get more details, because the music notes letters modify the message. This thing has got layers upon layers of information packed into it."

"Are you sure you're not reading into this at all? Like pulling data from the static?"

Malcolm shook his head gravely and passed me one of the papers. 

On it was the part of the song that went "When you talk like that you make a woman go mad" along side notations for the hip sways written beneath the lyrics.

 I look at the translations of Morse Code and turn hurriedly to my laptop and double check Malcolm's work.

"Holy. Shit."
"I know."
"She predicted President Trump."

Edit: punctuation issues, corrected a disaster.
