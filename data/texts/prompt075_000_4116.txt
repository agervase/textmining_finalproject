George got a call from Martha at Bloomsbury only two days after he turned in the final manuscript of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, which Martin advised calling *Harry Potter and the Dawn of Night*, mostly due to how he had written it.

"Hullo, Martha," he said.

"Hi, George." Her tone was Splenda-sweet, and George knew instantly something was off.

"Oh, you don't like the book."

"It's not that--"

"Fantastic. I take all this valuable time off working on book six, only for you people to turn around and tell me it's garbage." He had been making some scrambled eggs. He slammed the bowl down on the counter. "I can't wrangle with you wardens of art at the moment. I understand I wrote something perhaps more complicated ethically than Jo would have, but I think she'd find the tone really matches how her characters have matured into adulthood."

"I agree with you in spirit," the editor said, carefully. "However, do you believe it was necessary to have a Slytherin student effectively addicted to killing?"

"No battle is fun without a blood-monger."

"Well, I don't think our book's fan base will be invigorated to learn that Hermione is gutted by a brand new character when she goes to find Ron and is left to die. Or that when Ron found her the new student--" she paused, apparently to find the right line "'spilled open Ron's jugular in a thick spray of arterial scarlet', nor that Ron then 'collapsed, reaching for Hermione's still fingers, but not quite able to reach. They lay that way until the staff began the grim job of rounding up bodies, in the morning.' I mean, these are two of the primary characters. They just... died."

"As people do," George said, sagely.

"Listen. Today I would really like you to review your draft and reconsider what points you could revise." George scoffed, offended, but the editor continued relentlessly, "These people aren't wanting to read a George R.R. Martin book, you know? They're hoping for a sweet and wholesome conclusion where Harry Potter's friends aren't murdered by a power-hungry sociopath. Additionally, since this is technically a children's book, I think we'll need to remove both sex scenes." 

"Both?"

"Both, George."

"Can I at least get a fade to black?" he asked, even though those were super lame and the domain of cop-out writers. No. George did not flinch when it came to life's many and varied fluids.

"Probably not." There was still a smile in her voice. "Okay, George? Does that all make sense?"

"I suppose." He stirred his scrambled eggs viciously. "I don't see why you would ask me to write it if you didn't want it to *sound* like me."

"Surely you can try a voice switch. Pretend you're an actor putting on a new accent."

George R.R. Martin hung up the phone and growled to his empty kitchen, "I don't *use* accents."

George skimmed a few pages of the draft edits he had received from Martha. He had cut out perhaps too much of the boring magic bits, except to give that Longbottom boy a flaming sword, but he needed a good redemption moment, George felt.

>Neville stood on the edge of the wall, staring grimly at the roving army of the dead ten thousand strong ***(really?? there's no legion of the undead in HP, George! (well, technically there is the Inferi army, but I know you had NO idea they existed, so you can't pretend that's what you meant.))*** below him, like a boiling sea of ants, just as relentless and hungry for war. He unsheathed his sword called Death Eaters' Bane, its pommel a snarling lion with red-jeweled eyes. It had been his father's sword. Perhaps if Frank Longbottom had been carrying Bane when the Lestrange fell upon him that bleak night, he would be alive to pass his sword onto his son himself.
>
>***I appreciate the tension but we said you can't write your own backstory. You get a little carried away.***

The next passage was the only critique George agreed with.

>Dumbledore turned his wand on one of the Slytherin students, who had just sent a first-year Hufflepuff, running for her life, into an early grave. The raw heat of his anger locked the child in place and he raised his wand, eyes red and mad with fury, like a bear who's just seen its cub murdered.
>
>"That," Dumbledore murmured, "was a very poor choice indeed."
>
>He performed a rending curse and the boy split open and scattered across in the dining hall, his bones clinking dully against the stone.
>
>The headmaster hurried away to the rest of the battle.

This time Martha's note read simply: ***DUMBLEDORE DIED ALREADY. You can't bring him back just to kill him again. And he wouldn't murder a student like that...***

"Wait," George said to himself. "Really?" He double checked his notes. That seemed to be from the part Jo wrote. He always told himself he'd get around to reading that, but why bother when his publisher gave him such a good summary already.

When he finished reading, most of the manuscript seemed solid. Martha, it seemed, was grossly overreacting. For example, Martha did not care for Harry removing Voldemort's head at the end. She explained that it would make more sense for his old age and the wrongness of his being to make him simply disappear.

George rolled his eyes. "What kids don't like a good bit of beheading?" And besides, it would be reckless to use a rule that so readily eschews physics. George was a man of realism, after all. He did not put things in books that weren't *feasible*.

And then, of course, he ended with the respective love interests finally bedding. Any story about bodies and fervor must acknowledge the softer side of if. Martha had struck out the whole scene of Ginny crying over her dead brothers and then leaping into Harry's bed shortly afterward.

Below it she wrote only the words, ***no no NO George. Not appropriate!***

George called Martha up when he finished reading. When she answered, wearily, he said, "What if just Ron dies? Would that be okay?"

"And the sex scenes."

George was quiet for a long moment.

"*George*," she said, sternly. "You promised Jo you'd write *her* book, not *your* book."

He whined like a child, "Gods, you make everything so much worse," and hung up on her. When he calmed down, he would take all the good bits out of it. 

For now, it was time to go to his file on *The Winds of Winter* and rewrite the same sentence over and over again for a few hours. Surely that would count as progress.

ETA: The conversation that finally makes George quit the project

G: (angrily) Look, I'm never going to win a Hugo off this thing with Jo's underdeveloped ideas and predictable plots.

M: Well, Jo's ideas had no problem [beating yours out for a Hugo before](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/28vc30/til_that_george_rr_martins_a_storm_of_swords_lost/).

G: \*rage quits*
