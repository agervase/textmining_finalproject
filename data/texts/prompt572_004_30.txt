Trying to remember something... Just out of reach. It is always hovering right there, but before you can reach out and grab it there is something there to int-

"Dad, are clouds made of candy?"

"What? Of course not, lad. They should have taught you about the water cycle by now... What are they even teaching you in school..."

I look down at the boy to my side, the spitting image of me and...

"Where is your mother?"

He looks up at me, a dark look just beneath the surface. The thought still out of reach... A number perhaps?

"Don't worry about mom. What are Earth's defenses like, daddy?"

"Earth's defenses?" A number. *Don't worry about mom* A number. Just out of reach.

Oh damn a number. The number!

The boy's eyes turned a solid black, staring at me, staring into my mind and soul.

"Tell me about Earth's defenses. Tell me about the WarSats, the defense grid. I want to know."

The number was back. I'd found it, and I clung to it like it was the only thing keeping me alive. The only thing keeping me sane.

"Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551. Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551."

My mantra. The words and numbers to repeat. Protect Earth. Protect my ship. Protect myself. The order of precedence. The order of importance.

The voice was harsher, less boyish this time.

"Tell me about Earth's D-"

"Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551. Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551." Louder this time. Drown out the questions.

Over my chanting I could hear things, the felt like they were outside the world, and coldness rushed in, blanking out the field we had been sitting in. I was now in a cold dark room, surrounded by machinery and bright lights.

"Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551."

I heard an inhuman sound coming from behind me. Sounds that was processed quickly by my implants, but I was only dimly aware of the translations being fed to me.

"... No good..."

"Can't get anything else out of him." Anything else?

"No use to us like this. He's regained enough of himself to resist."

"End it."

"Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551." I repeat the chant. It is all that is keeping me together.

I feel more cold closing in, rushing into my mind. It is a deeper cold this time.

"Marcus K. Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551."

It's closing in on my brain. Making it harder to think. To feel.

"Salvador. Lieutenant Commander. 227-166287-776551."

Everything is black now. I can't hear the implants talking to me.

"Salvador. 227-166287-776551."

I'm losing time. I don't and can't. There simply isn't. Thoughts fragmenting.

"227-166287-776551."

At least I found the numbers again.
