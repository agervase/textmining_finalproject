6 am in the morning, I got to wake up. "Another day in hell," I said to myself while crawling out of the mess I call a bed. At days like, I keep remembering what my grand-grandfather used to say.

&#x200B;

"Teemo, you should always strive to be the lizard your heart tells you to be. You are who you are and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It will get hard, you will face many problems, there will be times where you will feel powerless and lost, but as long as you keep moving forward, you will have no regrets and know that you're at least "moving".

&#x200B;

My grand-grandfather was my idol, he was the kindest and the smartest lizard I've ever known, liked by both lizards and humans. He accepted humans as equals, even though their average IQ is twice as lower as ours. He told us that we all deserve to live equally, being kind to another and supporting each other, despite the appearances, color or intellect.

&#x200B;

When we came to Earth two thousand years ago with a goal to learn from developing species and make them our allies in the future, my grand-grandfather was the key figure in developing our strategy on Earth. After the examination of human behavior, he reached the conclusion that humans have a highly developed EQ in compensation of their lower IQ. He noted that their emotions are their strength and weakness at the same time. 

&#x200B;

He understood that by giving humans more reasons to reach inner peace on the emotional level, will allow them to develop faster and reach happiness. That's why he, with his comrades, introduced a list of rules described in a story he made up. That story was accepted by humans and the name of my grand-grandfather is remembered and worshiped even now. 

&#x200B;

"You will encounter difficulties in life", the words of grand-grandfather were echoing in my head. Living with humans have helped us develop our EQ to the point where we become just like them. Feeling so overwhelmed by the emotions of what I want to be and how I am currently doing makes me so depressed and powerless. It feels like I'm just existing and drifting, with no meaning in life. It's like Iâ€™m no good I should run away and all the failures are one step ahead of me.

&#x200B;

I just want to chase my dreams and become a writer, just like my grand-grandfather, but I just can't force myself to dedicate the actions needed. Each day it's all the same - I woke up, go to work and spend the rest of the day browsing the internet like a zombie. At least stories about "Lizard people ruling the world" keeps me entertained, but at the same, it keeps me pushing the idea that I must be the one to unite these two civilizations and create a future of possibilities and happiness.

&#x200B;

This dream makes me blame myself that I'm not good enough, but at the same time, I have no willpower to change how I live and how I act. I've entered the samsara; the loop of meaningless existence and I need to get out of it as fast as I can. 

&#x200B;

"Time to wake up, enough with the daydreaming", I've said to myself. I slowly crawled from the mess I call bed and went straight to take a shower. It's the best part of the day - getting refreshed. Luckily, our advanced technology helped us genetically change our bodies to match the ones humans own. This made us look identical to humans and even made the process of mating possible. 

&#x200B;

After my least favorite meal - oatmeal, I got dressed up and went straight to the bus. I like riding the bus because I've got to experience being really close to the humans and observe them. This makes me feel like I'm part of them and makes me really happy.  "The next stop is the Freedom Avenue", said the voice in the bus, time to get off.

&#x200B;

"Alright, new day, let's try to take the actions and decisions I really want to make today", I said to myself, while knowing that I won't, like I usually do. In the end, it never happens, I'm never satisfied with myself - at least I'm being honest with myself about it.

&#x200B;

"What are you daydreaming about?", said the sweet voice beside me.

&#x200B;

I got flustered seeing a rather cute girl asking me a question, "Uh... Well, I was just thinking about how I should unite humankind and lizard civilization so we could all strive for a better tomorrow". Shit, I said without thinking. Now she'll think I'm a weirdo or an Otaku. 

&#x200B;

"Lizard civilization? My god... Please don't tell me you also believe that the Earth is flat?!", she said with a cute smirk on her face and gazed into my eyes for an answer.

&#x200B;

I looked straight to her face to state the obvious fact "The nonsense that the Earth is flat is as stupid as the rumor that the world is ruled by the lizards". It took me a few seconds to digest what I've just said and to notice how her eyebrows raised with surprise. I've just made a fool out of me and she'll think I'm someone weird.

&#x200B;

All I want is to find someone to be comfortable with, to love and be loved and most importantly to support each other through pain and happiness. I guess that will never be a reality. After all, even though this girl is the cutest person I've ever met, she's still out of my league, even if I succeed in impressing her.

&#x200B;

 She started to laugh "Well it's still better to believe in lizard society than that the Earth is flat". 

&#x200B;

"I need to turn right, are you going to the same direction?", I asked her with hopes to get the positive answer.

&#x200B;

"Uh, no, I'm not. Well, it was fun talking to you, see you next time!", she said with a beautiful smile that got me feeling like I was struck by a love thunder. 

&#x200B;

For a moment I stopped thinking about all my fears, insecurity and all the consequences. I've finally made an action, the one that my heart truly wanted, "Hey it really was, can we connect on Instagram?".

&#x200B;

My heart started beating, it was like I gambled my life on the game I'm destined to lose to. 

&#x200B;

"Yeah sure, It's Kim010Kim ", she said with the face full of joy and happiness as she moved to the opposite direction.

&#x200B;

I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing. If felt like I exploded with happiness and excitement. My whole body seemed like it was floating in the air like a balloon and my head was spinning like crazy. It felt like a total blackout for a few seconds, until I noticed that I've forgotten the username she told me! Crap!

&#x200B;

I've started to look around with the goal to find a person in a distance with whitish curly hair. She was gone. For a moment, I felt devasted and stupid, but then I realized that my life has gotten a meaning, I need to find her again.

&#x200B;

For the first time in my life, I knew exactly what I need to do and why.
