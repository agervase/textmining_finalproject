> As we trek to my home world, I find myself waxing nostalgic. Memories of times long past plant themselves within my mind, having slipped through the cracks of my subconscious. I record these thoughts here not in warmth towards my origins. This entry exists to purge the memories from my mind, as I have forsaken my home world, just as it had done to me.

> Today, I thought of my name. Before I began my life as Karg, Conqueror of the Pit, I went by the name of Roger Henderson.

> Roger served his country valiantly, fighting for what he thought was freedom. His experience on the battlefield were harsh, yet his resolve remained. Soon after returning home, he was greeted with the cold indifference many of his brothers and sisters in arms had before him. Still, this omen of what was to come did not faze Roger and he stuck to his beliefs.

> Years had passed, and on 13,746,291,985 Roger faced his final betrayal. He had received a letter one week prior from his government, requesting his aid in a special mission that his abilities as a warrior qualified him for. He was to meet a liason in a covert location for his briefing. Shortly after arriving, Roger lost consciousness. He came to in unfamiliar surroundings. He lay still, unable to move as an alien creature informed him of his new fate.

> His name was now Klarg, or blade slave in English, and he was to be a pet. His government had sold him off in exchange for information and solitude. The rest of his life would be devoted to the Pit, an intergalactic fighting ring built for the amusement of the many alien species inhabiting the universe.

> Today, my Nostalgia brought me to the Pits. Just as well, as my destination is just hours away. My men and I have been training since we set out, and distractions, even within the mind, are not something I have time for.

> Every fight was a bloodbath, to the death, as was the only rule. The sound of the roaring crowd purging their bloodlust vicariously through myself and the Klarg I was set to kill mixing with the rushing of blood in my inner ear would set my mind racing. The drugs they pumped into me before a match, forcing my body to produce adrenaline and bringing a rage-induced foam to my mouth. The strange disconnect I felt with the melee weapons I was given after a lifetime with an assault rifle. The warmth as I was splattered with my opponent's lifeblood, and the sick pleasure the drugs made me derive from it.

> As I fought my way through the ranks, the exact purpose of the Pits and Klargs became apparent to me. The spectators went into a rage that was comparable to the one induced in the Klargs via drugs. However, the brief glimpses of life outside I was able to catch were idyllic and peaceful. Then, I began to observe them more during fights. They entered with the same energy they had outside, and as soon as the fight was over, they would cool down until they left with the same energy they entered.  They were purging violence from themselves by watching us fight.

> This realization should have stung, but by that point, my body had adapted to the drugs and I didn't really care much anymore. It worked, and my body had adapted to the drugs. I enjoyed the fight. The only problem I had was that I was fighting on someone else's terms, not my own. I then began to devise a plan. I only felt one thing aside from a desire for the fight: revenge. The world I left did nothing but forsake me at every turn.

> Many of the champions felt similarly, and we resolved to break free of the control of Coalition once we had a large enough force. We stole a ship, and outfitted it for war. The champions all decided that I should lead them, since I both had strength and started our exodus.

> We make landfall tomorrow.

> I briefed the warparty on Earth's combat capabilities. Our cybernetic enhancements and superior weaponry would allow us to match them. This time however, there are more rules: we won't kill innocents or noncombatants. Only military and government officials. Well plunder the planet for resources and move on to the next.

> Now, I rest. My vengeance will soon be at hand, and so too will the rest of the crew's. We aren't sure what we'll do after this is all done however. Maybe we'll keep fighting in the Pit. None of us care though. A fight is a fight after all.
