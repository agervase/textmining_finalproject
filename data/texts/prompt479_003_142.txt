"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!"

Everyone paused. "What? Thomas? What's wrong?"

"THERE'S NO MOON! THERE'S NO FUCKING MOON!" Thomas stood staring at the sky.

Everyone shook their heads. Brian took the lead. "So what, Thomas? Come on, we're gonna be late for the party."

"NO, FOR GOD'S SAKES MAN, CAN YOU NOT SEE? THERE IS NO MOON! OH, DEAR LORD, THE HUMANITY!"

The other ones exchanged looks. *Thomas being Thomas again…*

"Thomas, who cares if there's no moon? Come on, the open bar ends at one, we're late already."

"OH DEAR GOD WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE WHERE'S THE MOON!?" Thomas took Angela by the collar of her shirt. 
"WHERE IS THE MOON, WOMAN, WHERE IS IT!?" He started shaking.

"Bro, get your shit together."

Finally, they drove off. Thomas shivered and mumbled to himself the whole way, eyes out the car window at the sky, searching.

They arrived at the party. It was a luau. Thomas managed to calm down when Jerry pointed him the moon behind 
some clouds.

"Oh, there she is, cool," he said. He took a red cup and sipped. "Man, this party is awesome. I wish I –" he paused.

"Thomas? What's wrong?"

His eyes were locked behind Jerry's shoulders. Jerry turned, then turned back. "Thomas?"

"The ocean, Jerry," Thomas said. "There's a storm."

"Yeah. Probably gonna be good for surfing tomorrow, right? I think –"

"JERRY FOR GOD'S SAKES THERE'S A STORM IN THE OCEAN OH DEAR JESUS WE'RE DOOMED!"

Everyone turned. Thomas was on his knees, sand dripping from between his fingers onto the ground, pleading eyes to the sky. "OH MERCIFUL GODS, PLEASE SPARE US!"

"The fuck is wrong with that dude?" someone asked.

"shrooms, probably," another replied.

"THE SEA IS IN STORM, YOU FOOLS!" Thomas bellowed. "THE SEA IS IN STORM! RUN!"

Brian shook his head. "Why do we keep bringing Thomas to these things?"

"OH THE PAIN AND THE MISERY AND THE HORROR! THE ABSOLUTE HORROR!"

"And now the girls are leaving. Nice going, Thomas."

"DEATH AND DESPAIR AND BEYOND!"

"And the police is coming."

"Let's get out of here."

They left. Thomas stayed behind, kneeling on the sand. A police officer approached.

"Hey, buddy, you all right?"

Thomas looked up, eyes red with tears. "Officer… I'm sorry… I'm just… so afraid."

"It's okay, buddy. Come on, let's get you to the station and you can sober up."

The officer helped Thomas off of his feat. Thomas was shaking and very agitated.

"I just need you to stop screaming, okay? Can you do that? Can we go quietly?"

"Yeah, no, I'm okay," Thomas said, still avoiding looking at the sea and the sky. "I'm fine. I'll be gentle. I'm a bit angry but I'll be gentle."

The officer stopped on his feet. "What?"

"I said I'll be gentle."

A second went by in silence. The abandoned bonfire hissed. The wind flapped the flames. The sky shifted and shuffled its clouds.

"OH DEAR LORD AN ANGRY GENTLE MAN!" The police officer bellowed, because he too was wise like Thomas and also because I didn't know how else to end this story.
