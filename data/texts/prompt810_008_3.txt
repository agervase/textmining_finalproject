Here's the thing about plate armour. It is great at deflecting slashes. It might even be able to stop an arrow at long distance. But it sucks ass when it's up against a high velocity projectile that will distribute its' energy on a tiny area on the armour. Naturally, my savage opponent does not know this. After all, he's a medieval knight, trained in the art of war with hack and slash weapons. I'm a 21st century dude with a man-bun, and a degree in engineering, so the odds are somewhat in my favour, I'd say. Oh, and did I mention I had mandatory military training, and was able to time travel with a small arsenal of 21st century weapons? Yeah, I'd bet on me, too, if I could.

I size up my opponent, brandishing his lavishly decorated armour. It sure does look impressive. The golden details on it shine when the sunlight hits it just right. His red cape flowing in the wind. His ironclad warhorse would strike fear into the heart of any of these medieval people. Me? I drive an SUV in real life, which would turn this horse into fraudulently-labelled Lasagna meat without breaking a sweat.

From the corner of my eye, I see the princess blow my opponent a kiss. She obviously is hoping for him to win. I wonder why. The guy is truly a mountain of a man, but judging by the way he keeps throwing glances at the alchemist, I wouldn't be surprised if his gains were perhaps not all natural. His body somehow looks disproportionate. His biceps are huge, but his forearms are like twigs. Sir Synthol, indeed.

Fuck the medieval times, though. I travelled here for the tournament, in order to win the hand of one of the most magnificent creatures in history. I did not think about the fact I would not be able to amp myself up with my usual start of the day; a Machiato with Chia seeds using a triple shot of Soy milk. Nor do they have any vegan option food available. It's all pork this, lamb that, or other non-defined meats I wouldn't dare to wager a guess at the origins of. I can't wait to leave here and make a decent Kale shake when I come home.

The king indicates we are to proceed, and my opponent rides to the far end of the field, his horse steaming with sweat from under its plate and the tough woollen blanket underneath. He lowers his visor, while I calmly await on my side of the field on top of the pony I picked up earlier. She's an old work horse, and is currently acting up on my allergies. I attempted to lodge a complaint with the tournament organisation about discrimination of people with severe allergies, but they stared at me and questioned "mine sanity". One even offered to hook me up with the local maester for leech treatment. Yeah, no thanks. 

&#x200B;

The king gives the signal, the flag drops, and my opponents' horse starts charging. His shield comes up, his lance comes down. My horse proceeds with alight tread, much to the amusement of the crowd. "Ser Bronie" they dubbed me. Let's see who has the last laugh once I unleash the fury of my arsenal on them. As the knight comes closer and closer, his lance now inching towards where he expects my heart to be in a few seconds, I pull my Glock, and calmly take aim at his head, and squeeze the trigger. 

&#x200B;

"BAM", it goes, with the echoes bouncing around the valley. As I watch the knight's helmet explode, brains and skull pieces blowing out the back like a meaty mist, I jump of my pony, that got startled by the gunshot. The pony wasn't the only one, though. The entire crowd, king and princess included cower. The only one who seems more intrigued than startled is the alchemist, who can be heard mumbling: "So it's true!". He has a massive grin on his face, and almost seems to be gleefully jolly. 

&#x200B;

The king just stares at his best knight's body, lying headless in the dirt, thick squirts of blood still oozing out of the neck. The look of disbelief on his face quickly turns to rage though, as he points a chubby finger my way. "KILL THAT MAN", he shouts, his guards quickly jumping back on their feet. Suddenly, I have to dodge arrows, spears and crossbow bolts. I make quick work of a few of the closest guards, and then point my weapon at the kind, telling him he's next unless he calls off his soldiers. Before the whiff of smoke from the last bullet disappears from the barrel of my Glock, the king does as ordered. His face is twisted into a murderous expression. 

&#x200B;

"Doest thou really expect me to marry off my daughter to the likes of you?", he proclaims. "Sire, those were the conditions of the tournament", I reply. "I won fair and square". "Fair?" yells the king. "FAIR? Sir, thou uses black magic to defeat my best knight. Thou costest me a fortune". The princess also has a terrified look on her face. "I want to marry a real knight, not some scrawny bookwurm such as thouself. Daddy, kill him!". The king gives a signal to his guards, and an arrow hits my knee from behind, dropping me to the floor. I take aim at the king, but when I press the trigger, my gun jams. At the same time, I feel a sword slash my side. Frantically, I try to kick the knight towering over me, using my best Yoga move. It's to no avail. 

&#x200B;

"But princess, I know that I love you", I exclaim. Her reply comes as yet another blow of a sword delivers the coup de grace. "You know nothing, Jon Snowflake".
