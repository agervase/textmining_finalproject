Cax looked out on the bridge at the emptiness of space, staying out of sensor range meant it was to far to see the planet, but he still imagined he could do so. He smirked. It was almost unbelievable that these "earthlings" naturally produced adrenaline. It was common for those who knew about the planet to zoom down and nab a few humans. Beam them up give them a light probing and you got your fix but Cax wasn't here for a small time score. No, the Fe'kek had given him the chance to prove himself here. He would set up a major operation, and he wasn't going with the uncouth option of kidnap and torture, no the humans would give him what he wanted and be thankful for it too.

Jeremy heaved a contented sigh as he awoke to a new day things had grown so amazing in the year since first contact, the amazing technology that the aliens had shared made life so much better, the advances in prosthetics, local space travel, and most importantly to him virtual reality. He stretched and wondered what new adventure he would go on today, maybe he'd try a secret agent, or a knight, hell his friend had been wanting to try the zombie apocalypse sim as a group for weeks. he went out the door and made his way down town to the hub, he checked in want went to a pod.

Cax was very pleased, the humans really believed in a free lunch. They really believed that they were operating the sim pods out of the goodness of their hearts to improve global happiness, morons. They hop in the pods get pumped and then they get drained. Not many of then even questioned how they could come out of what seems like a fight for their very lives and be calm afterwords. And them hoping around their local system and colonizing every half habitable rock they could find masked the shipments out quite nicely. If no one else stumbled on the system they would make a fortune and he would have cemented his place in the Fe'kek family.
