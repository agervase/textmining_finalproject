"Hey, remember me? Britain, 1800's?" A young. ragged looking man pulls up a chair and orders a draught.

&#x200B;

"Excuse me?" I turn to him, my face goes numb.

&#x200B;

"C'mon, you've gotta recognize me! I thought after the accident, you were donso, but no one could find even a piece of hair from the scene." He takes a couple sips, unzips his coat and makes himself comfortable.

&#x200B;

I look around and lean in closer. "Listen here, I don't know what you're talking about. Does it look like I've been around since the 1800s, and if so, why of all people should I remember you?"

&#x200B;

He pulls down on his scruffy v-neck to reveal a very faint scar. "Well, maybe its because I'm the one you shot in the god-damned chest! Listen, Bellingham, you don't have to worry. Times change and I forgive you."

&#x200B;

As I take a sip, a chill runs down my spine. He made me very nervous, but he seemed calm. I don't know what was bugging me.

&#x200B;

"Look, mister, I really have to go. It's already ten o'clock and my wife must be worried. Maybe I'll catch ya on the flip side."

&#x200B;

I tip the bartender and fasten my pace just a tad, just to get out of the place. But just as I was leaving, I felt a cold needle pierce my body, and I fall to my knees. The man whispers into my ears "C'mon Bellingham. You've got to put up more of a fight than that. Meet me at Kaunos, and we'll battle like real celestials." And like that, he was gone.

&#x200B;

"Damned bastard, I guess I wasn't the only one left."

&#x200B;

"You okay sir?" The bartender helps me up, "Oh god, you alright?? You were just shot?!?"

&#x200B;

"Listen here man, there ain't no such thing as a god. But, there are others with hidden gifts." And just like that, I'm gone. I'm off to fight my assassinee. Mr. Spencer Perceval.
