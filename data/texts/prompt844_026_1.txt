Y'know, the hours are murder on my internal clock. But work with what you love and you never work a day in your life, they say.

The weekend was over, it was Monday. Back to routine as usual. Slide the card through the white reader, wait for the beep. Wait for the white door to open, walk into the white office onto the polished white floor. It was pretty dull, but for an office it was... say, larger than your average living room. I can live with that. Starting off the week like a zombie, I head inside.

"Good morning, Nine" I leaned into the wall closest to me, resting my head on my own arm. Dug through the wall was corridor, a wide square arch separating the passage and the office the most it could with no form of object within it's faces. My tone was nearly dead, i'd hardly been able to sleep. "Get some good rest?"

"I slept just fine." Nine's voice sounded inside my head, skipping directly past the drums in my ears and straight into my brain. Her eight giant eyes gently, yet quickly blinked open one by one, like a delicate red wave washing over a black shore. Her two giant arachnid front legs gently reached out from the back of her room, settling comfortably on the ground right nearby my slumped position. She rested her monstrous head in her limbs. "But you don't seem quite as such, you fell asleep talking online with your friend again didn't you? Right in the middle of leveling your character, too."

"Hey, hey! you know I don't like it when you read my mind like that." I playfully protest, smiling despite it and reaching out to give one of the giant legs a ticklish wiggle of my fingers. A giggle rumbled from between her mandibles, giant arachnid body jittering as she pulls the ticklish appendage away.

"And YOU know, I can't handle it when you do THAT." She continues, still giggling. Her tone was rather dull on top of all this, maybe wasn't as well rested as she let on. But then again, I can't quite read minds like she does. Maybe I could offer her a cup of coffee... assuming the higher ups finally got that damned thing working.

"Eh, but yeah, I haven't been parting my time very well lately... it's really nipping me, but I can't help it." I slump back against the wall, standing inside the arch to look at her, hands in my pockets.

"You can always sleep here, if you'd like. You know we won't bite." The spiders tenderly offers. She wasn't exactly wrong.

"Yeah, but... I dunno, it feels sorta weird to sleep at work knowing you're gonna be here FOR work in a number of hours. I dunno, it doesn't do it for me." I idly shake my head. I've thought about it, heck I wouldn't really mind it some time.

"Well at least, I know you're THOUGHT about it." She chirps in, legs settling back into position and resting her large head again. All her eyes seemed to be smiling.

"Do I have to tickle you again?" I laugh, leaning myself in closer, lowering my head at her.

"**She's brittle, you can't go around doing that Thomas~.**" A deeper resonant voice chimes into the conversation from across the room, just about diagonal from where Nine and I already were. A large green, purple speckled, pink underbellied tentacle flops out from the near pitch black cell, weaved between the thick metal bars. Just the local Eldritch God, "Zor" as we called him and he requested he be called. He was a bit of a nerd. I push against the wall and like a ragdoll coming to life, stand myself up and saunter over towards the large appendage, eyelids tingling with the desire to close themselves. This early on I couldn't expect my brain to be stimulated enough to keep me much awake beyond walking. I wave back to Nine as I step away and make my way across the room.

"Oh yeah, then why don't you let me put you through a round, see how 'brittle' she is compared to you?" I cock an eyebrow still with a smile, slumping my army green pack onto to counter nearby and pulling the zippers apart. It was easy to be playful around this lot.

"**Huhuhuh... maybe... But first thing's first.**" The voice resonates towards me. He wanted to be patient with me, but it's been a whole *two days* since Zor's gotten his daily news and his funnies. A few thuds were heard against the wall in Nine's residence from her shifting position.

"Oh don't worry, I have your goods. Just... give me a quick moment." I rummage through my pack, mostly just organizing everything for the day. A few bottles and vials of questionable contents Esther requested of me, papers, today's lunch. The papers weren't difficult to find, they didn't fit in my bag so they were sticking out from the zipper the entire time, rolled into two nice tidy tubes. I could feel a titanic yellow eye peering at me idly, and his tentacle slips further through the bars, showing off it's pink underside. "Alright man, here ya' go. I got little treat for you too. Got two papers this time! Read em' at your leisure." I hold both rolls in both hands, placing them onto the tentacle.

"**Oh my, marvelous!**" He sounded ecstatic, wasn't all that hard to please him. I wanna get him a big collection book of "Calvin and Hobbes" some day for something special, I just hope he doesn't actually burst from excitement. I step over to my desk and throw myself into the plush gray chair provided. I kick at the ground and swivel around to face another white table just off to my left, rolling myself towards the coffee machine. I heard Zor giggling in his chamber. His love for those little comic strips never failed to make me smile, ever as early as it was and as tired as I am. I click a button at the base of the machine and tap the screen. And I roll my eyes and grimace as a tiny red caution sign flashes at the top corner of the screen, it's still out of commission. I give the device a tiny thwap on the dome, even if that wouldn't fix anything. Weeks, this thing has been busted for weeks now.

"Say... Zor, I don't ask much." I cup my hands around my mouth, trying not to let the pillowy chair push my temptations to nap any further... for the time being at least. "You're... a god, can you fix up this damn machine for me, it's been weeks..." I called to him, my tone irritated by the lack of attention my requests have seemed to receive. I didn't want to complain at him and and dump my problems, but it couldn't be helped. And it seemed that my concerns fell flat, as I wasn't met with a response. I know he could hear me, but he seemed wrapped up in his reading. I could tell the difference between being heard and being listened to, and I certainly wasn't receiving the latter. Not quite dejected, just... lacking caffeine, I kick lightly off the ground and wheel over to my mini-fridge, pull out one of the ice coffees I had stored. I roll myself back to my desk and set the cold plastic cup onto the table, taking a much needed sip from it. I could see the reflection of Zor's glowing yellow eye in the monitor before I clicked it on, and I heard Nine idly bumping her legs against the wall. I slump my head into my hand as the screen flicks on, displaying the system's boot up screen. I yawn and take another sip, listening to the soft thumping on the wall.

I can live with this.

I absolutely eat stuff like this up, this was a really fun write. Was nice and chill because I was and still currently am listening to "My Homie" from Persona 5 the entire time I was writing it. Thanks for the prompt!
