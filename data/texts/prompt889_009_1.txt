 

All I could hear was a ringing in my ears. I open my eyes and it was so bright. For a second I thought I was going to be talking to God. I got up out of my daze and realize what happened. I looked to my right and saw that the fuselage had a giant crack in the floor, and that there was tons of sand and dirt all over the floor. I hear the ocean waves, At this point I realize that my flight has crashed, and my first instinct was to get out and check for any survivors, and for anyone that could help. After searching the fuselage, and the fragments of the cockpit and tail, it looked like I was the only one left alive. I had to get away from the crash site to get my mind off of all those innocent people who died.

At first I thought we crashed on Bermuda, Because my flight was originally going from JFK to LCY, and this would be the only Island in between the two airports. But I looked for any sign of civilization, any hotels, roads, boats, anything that would indicate that someone else was here besides me. After a half hour of walking around this island, no sign of Civilization, AT ALL. No body, cars, boats, or roads to be found. The only things I found was more debris from what I could only assume to be more planes. I was completely alone, as well as confused, "Why're so many planes falling out of the sky on this Island?" I muttered to myself. I turned into a cove and found a group of other survivors.

All of them looked pretty badly beat up, and wearing tattered clothes. I didn't want them to think I was hostal, instead of approaching them, I first screamed over "Hey! Are you guys from flight 320?" waving my arms and everything from roughly 50 feet away. A couple of the survivors looked up, and waved me over. I walked over to their camp and asked them what happened and what flight they were from. The first person I talked to was a shorter blond teen, she looked around 19, and only spoke what sounded like Russian, I could already tell that this was going to be a dead end since I lost my pen and papers, I couldn't even physically draw out what I was trying to convey to them. I walked away from her and went to the next person at the makeshift camp, This guy was easily the most red of anyone in the group. he 6'5 and looked like he could probably stomp me out if he wanted to, the bulging muscles didn’t make me think he was any friendlier. I asked him "Hey what flight were you on, and what's happening here?", and he with some merical, spoke English, super strong southern accent though. He Started a ramble that started off semi coherent, I at least could understand the flight number he gave me " yup' parter i wuz on flight 393. Teh names peter, I'll tell you hwhat..." and then quickly devolved to grunts and facial expressions. Peter wasn't on my plane, and he also didn't look very worried about the situation. I assume he was probably one of the first guys for this to happen to. I asked him how long he's been here and he told me " ye' i been heer bout 2ish weeks damn near starvin right bout now" He didn't sound very happy about being here for so long. I continued onto the next person, who was about a 5'8 Guy who had a full beard, and genuinely looked like a knock off Bear Grylls, but shorter, and looked less adventurous. He starts in a panic "Hey new guy?! Do you have any food? I'm desperate, I've been here for 84 hours and I'm out of water, and food! I'm dying man! My stomach feels so empty right now I'd do anything for some food or a bottle of water." I backed up a bit, and rushed to say "Whoa Hey, Cool it, I'm not the coast guard, red cross, or anyone that would have supplies for you. Just back up, barely giving me room to breath. Could you tell me What flight number were you on?" He was too panicked about food and water he pretty much ignored me, I didn’t want to get badgered about food and water again so I let him be to go annoy some other survivor. I went to the rest of the group and asked each of them, all of them came back with a different flight number 331, 392, 342, 304, and 382. At this point we’ve concluded that we’re all the lone survivors of our flights and that we’re all from different flights, but the same airliner, Since all Delta flight numbers start with a 3. We all decide it’s getting too dark for us to continue trying to piece together what’s happened, and all go bed.

The next morning, I heard a loud crash right above me, the only thing I was thinking was “I guess I’m not the last guy to come to the island…” I along with the rest of the survivors go out and look for who we thought was the next person, turned out to be a giant Red Cross Create. I along with Peter go up to the crate and open it up, as we’re cracking it open, we find a armory worth of weaponry, and as I pulled one of the Rifles out to see if there was any clues to wear it came from, an ear piercingly loud alarm sounded from the box, “Now. It. Starts.”. The alarm startled me so much that I dropped the rifle, and with my luck it goes off.

&#x200B;

This threw everyone into a panic and by the time I picked my rifle back up everyone else had already fought over one, and I wasn’t looking to be caught in the crossfire on panicked strangers, I did the one thing I knew I could in that moment, and I ran, all the way back to my planes wreak. It sounded like a damn warzone just barely in the background. I tried to stay hidden for as long as I could, after a half hour, it sounded like it was over, and I walked over cautiously to see what happened, and at least half the survivors are dead on the ground in what looks like a makeshift mass grave. I was devastated that one of us could’ve done anything like that. It smelled so thickly of metal in the air because of all the pooled up blood. I almost threw up just smelling it. I was slowly making my way back to my crash site, when I heard it, someone chambering a round in their rifle. It put the fear of god into me, I thought that was going to be it right then and there. Luckily I was able to kick up some sand behind myself and get it in their eyes. That luck was very short lived considering I slipped and Peter, got back up and made me bury the rest of the bodies in the mass grave, I didn’t get the chance to finish burying them As I was about to finish all I heard was a metal \*clang\* and it all went black.
