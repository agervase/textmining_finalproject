I’ve always been a loner.

Growing up, my overly protective single mother rarely let me out of the house. I was homeschooled, so I didn’t have many friends.

It was only at age 17, after my mother’s death that things got weird. I didn’t understand it at the time, but my whole world would change.

When my mother died, I had to start taking care of myself, starting with finances. It all started with a trip to the bank to figure out what to do with my mother’s bank account. I was speaking in a private room with one of the bank managers, when a man ran in waving a gun.

The robber was yelling at the tellers to fill bags with cash and yelling for everyone to come out to the foyer and lay down. I stood and left the room to follow his demands, but the second we locked eyes, he let out a big breath and simply walked right up to me and handed me his gun. He just kept saying “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.”

At that exact moment, the cops burst through the door. They looked between me and the robber, confused as to who to apprehend, when finally the manager jumped in front of me and said “it’s him you want!”

Everyone hailed me as a hero, but I had no clue what had happened. I was so confused.

Later that night, I was cooking dinner with the television on when I heard a news cast about the robbery. Curious, I walked over to get a better look.

A reporter was asking the handcuffed robber what made him hand his gun over to a stranger.

His said “It was that man. He filled me with a sense of peace and calm. In that moment, I realized what I was doing was beneath me and I didn’t want to have any part of it anymore. I was instantly filled with regret.”

Since then, all I have to do is be in the presence of someone considering evil, and it changes their minds. Big or small, young or old, it affects everyone the same.
