Ever since I was born I could see a number above everyone's head, for a while this number just seemed random, one person would have a 5, another would have a 27, and so on. The highest number that I had ever seen anyone have was around 73, but that was from a guy on TV who regularly went out into the wild. I've never actually checked but I'm pretty sure I also had this number on my own head.

*"What does this number mean?"* I've asked myself that question many times through out life, and never knew, that was before I was 21, when I finally had the question answered.

It was my birthday, I had just turned 21, me and my friends went out for some drinks, after eventually being refused any more drinks we went outside of the bar and drunkenly stumbled to a dark alley, trying to get protection from the rain.

That's when we heard footsteps, at first they were quiet, but no delay between them, at least not the one you would expect if you thought someone was walking, and yet they got closer, getting louder, with still no delay. But as we were sitting down and couldn't really think straight we just thought it was normal street noises, but eventually they stopped, and we looked up... at a guy wielding an axe.

We quickly dashed out of the alley, running a couple of blocks away, and, while thinking we had gotten away, I looked up, straight into a window, and I saw it, the number on my head, which I had never seen before, went from 278 to 279, while my two friends had went from 5 to 6 and 14 to 15. And I figured it out, what the number meant, what all the numbers meant, was the amount of times someone has escaped death.
