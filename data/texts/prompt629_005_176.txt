Do you know how many active gods are there? Three thousand five hundred and twenty seven. I counted.

Afterlife is hell for a non believer. Human, and to lesser extent animal souls are but a power source for the supernatural. And atheist souls especially so. No, we don't have any special powers, we just didn't spent any of our spiritual energy on prayer and worship while alive. So every God and Goddess is at my door, offering eternity in their paradise, for a small price of my soul in nine easy installments.

So here I am, in a mock up of my old flat, that my subconsciousness created when, upon my arrival, I collapsed unable to cope with the shock of the transition. 

I just woke up, and there is already knocking at my door. Bloody witnesses. I get up to give them a piece of my mind, but the corridor is blocked by a pile of junk mail. Somehow I know that there are precisely 3527 letters. Unless Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs wrote to me again, yes THEY can get you even here.

Now the landline phone starts to ring. A few seconds later my mobile joins in. Gods knocking at my door start arguing. It is too noisy, so I put my noise isolating headphones on and sit by my computer. Good thing my subconscious mind was able to recreate my whole steam library, or I would be bored into accepting one of the offers.

But only thing I get is an error message, apparently my mailbox is full. Indeed there are literally billions messages with headlines like: 72 local V1rg1ns are waiting for you.

That was the drop that spilled the camel's back, or something like that. I bellowed "Fuck you all! If I want a paradise I will make one myself."

There was a deep rumble from outside I could hear despite the headphones, then everything went quiet. The phones were silent, heap of mail was gone. And behind the door, an infinite white plane, waiting to be moulded into shape.
