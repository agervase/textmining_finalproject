Oh man, we talking about Bruce? Aw shit, I used to watch that motherfucker on the news when I was *your* age. *Yeah*, you bet your ass he was the best. Kinda stupid sounding, *The Bat Man*, but he scared the shit out people back in the day. You want to get a giant crazy asshole lookin like a bat waking you up in the middle of the night? Gotta remember, we didn't know shit at first, just watching this guy jump off rooftops and finding rapists on 4th street missing all their teeth. We thought he had magic powers like the rest of the freaks, no joke.

This fuckin' guy, he made people afraid like he was Santa Claus or some shit like that, like, *like he knew when you're sleeping and awake*, that kind of thing. Ha ha, but it was scary as shit back in the day. I'm telling you kid, *it was just one guy*. Living a double life so everyone think's he's some dipshit playboy? That's wild, ain't it? He ain't like those people we deal with now, they don't got no balls. They could never pull off the kind of personal dedication, hard work, risk to themselves needed, to pull something like that. Sure, the man stifled our operations worse than RICO - I mean c'mon, *he beat the shit out of my great uncle*, but I'm telling you, that is a man to *respect* and ***em-u-fuck-in-late***, you hearing me, kid? You're gonna be Made soon someday, and you gotta get back the mystique, the fear. We can't keep on just being *mere* Made Men, we gotta be... like... mythological. 

(Wow. Those days, huh? Oh, right.)

My point is, perception... it's part of respect. It's not like these fucking robots the GPD got patrolling every street. The cameras. That RDIF shit they got in everything. Which reminds me, we gotta get you to Vics, he'll dummy that shit right outta you. 

Come on kid, we gotta roll. I get the legs, you get the head. On three?
