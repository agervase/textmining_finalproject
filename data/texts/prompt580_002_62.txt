Issac sat down on his bed still wearing the perfectly fitted suit he wore to his uncle's funeral.  Uncle Rummy always said a good suit could get you far in life.  The laddies loved it too, according to him.  Issac examined the simple black notebook in his hands.  It was rather unassuming: dusty faux leather over aged paper, only about 7 inches tall and rather thin.  Issac flipped open to the first page.

*To Issac, my most prized possession.*

*If you're reading this I have surely passed from this world.  But, as a parting gift I give you this simple book and all the information it contains.  Now, don't worry, this isn't a normal book (ok, it is a normal book to everyone EXCEPT you, but that's besides the point).  In the following pages I promise more than the words of a dead man.*

*I'm sure you've noticed all the odds and ends I bring home and take to my workshop.  You'll come to find what they are soon enough.  You see Issac, I am a collector of extraordinary things.*

*...*

*Bah, you're already bored.  I'll skip to the point.  The things I collect are magical and fantastic in nature.  Yes.  You read that right.  Magic.  Powerful magic too.  And you son are the most powerful of all.  I can hear you now, "But how have I not noticed?"  You need to learn your powers to use them.  Think of it like stretching a muscle you didn't know you had.  Now, let's begin!*

Issac scratched his chin and he read through the passage.  Magic?  Powerful magic?  Issac had just assumed his Uncle wanted to appear on those antique shows at one point so he could show off a vintage license plat or obscure toy.  Issac then crackled a smile as he realized what was going on.  This was just one big prank.  What better way to mess with your nephew than to give him a book and tell him he's magical.  Typical.  Issac thought back to when they were in church one Sunday and Rummy had replaced the screws on the pastors chairs with wooden ones, painted to look like metal.  When the pastor sat down after his sermon his chair collapsed from under him.  The church hall erupted into laughter, even the pastor got over his initial shock and let out a chuckle.  

Issac returned to the book, flipping through the rest of the pages to find they were all filled in with his uncle's neat scrawl.  Surprising dedicated to the bit, thought Issac.  

*First, I want to teach you something simple, just to prove I'm not pulling your leg from beyond the grave.  Stretch out your hand and feel the air around your fingers.  Feel their temperature.  Now feel the air getting hotter.  Don't just image the air getting hotter, actually feel it on your finger tips.  Oh, I should've mentioned this, you might want some water handy.  Also do this outside, those drapes aren't cheap.  Practice this enough and you should start to notice the air around your fingers will start to warp and waver.  You know how you can see the fumes of an unlit-lighter if you look closely enough.  That's about what it should look like.  Now, if you haven't guess yet, fire will erupt from your fingers.  The hotter you think the fire is, the bigger it grows.  I'll get more into how to control it later, but for right now just focus on the flames and try to not burn anything.*

Pulling his attention away from the book, Issac looked at his fingers and made it a show to focus in on them, imaging them bursting into flames.  And, to his surprise he felt the air around his hand quiver.  It didn't quite heat up or change but he felt *something*.  As if to prove his uncle, and his own senses wrong, he stretched out his hand and felt the air.  Felt the gentle currents and bearably detectable eddies.  He felt the temperature.  The slightly cool sensation of drying sweat and the warming feeling of his heart beat.  Focusing on the temperature he felt it rise.  The air now felt hot like his hand was over a stove, not a burning sensation or one of discomfort, but hot all the same.  He lost his focus and the heat disappeared.  He rubbed his hands together, neither felt any different.  Not hotter or colder.  Even when he refocused and felt the air heat up.  Only the hand he focused on felt the heat.

Issac let out a long, "huh."  Completely taken aback by the recent events and entirely unsure as to how to process it.  He turned back to his hand, eager to see if he could indeed cause flames to erupt from them.  With a new found desire he found himself laser focused on getting his hand to burst into flames.  The air around his hand heated up, never unbearable and not quite uncomfortable but somehow very clearly hot.  The air quivered around his hand before red rivulets of flame sprung from his finger tips like ribbons of vibrant light.  "Woah!" Issac yelped as he witnessed his hand on fire.  With his concentration broken, the flames died out once again.  And just like before, his hand was no different.  Not any hotter or worse for wear.  Issac grabbed to book and opened to where he left off, nearly tearing a page in the process.  He kept reading, ravenous for the power bestowed upon him.
