Okay first off there was an explosion,  
A Big Bang like Penny and Sheldon,  
Fuckin’ with hats off while Leonard is cookin’,  
Some shit in the lab up a greenish puddin’,    
Same goop that floated in oceans,  
Stank as fuck but a powerful  potion,  
A gene pool so bizarre it led to me,  
Who likes takin' a shit while shaking Willy,  
It was bubble, bubble toil and trouble,  
Then single-cell amoebas started to double,  
Became that green stuff that sits in my pool,  
“Algae” the caretaker said when I bashed him,  
In the head for calling my trash in,  
To the radio station sayin’ I’m dirty,  
Cos dead skanks floating face down, see,  
Is not a good way to end your party.  


After algae there was a commotion, a Cambrian explosion,   
Bugs and ticks got a promotion, to suck on your ballsack causin' corrosion,  
Drinking blood caused populations to soar,   
Reptiles like lizards crawled over the floor,  
Getting their dicks stuck in Crack like a whore,  
Next came a big motherfucking dinosaur,  
Steppin' around up-high on all four,  
Stomping around killing mammals and other an’mals,  
It was David vs Goliath and if you think I’m joking,  
A stone came flying from space and went poking,  
A hole in the earth and killed em’ all dead,  
Like the one what cracked open Goliath's big head.  


Now that mammals were crawling around,  
Fuckin’ like rabbits made the phylo abound,  
Soon monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees,  
Hung off threes pulling their pee-pees, flinging feces,     
Till one day that kid fell in with Harambe,  
Everyone got all bummed out except for me,  
Made it to the voting booth gave him my cross,  
Called mommy and told her to floss,  
With hair from his ass because she did toss,  
Me out that time when I fucked the horse,  
She bawling and saying the primate can't rule,  
Told her to shut up and started to school,  
"Bitch, fuck off, don’thcha know I’m the boss?      
Rather a Gorilla in the White House than me."  
Oh wait, too late, President Trump-to be,  
Just made it legal to grab her pussy.  


Where was I, wait, my story’s not done,  
Before I forget o tell you the one,  
Where Homo Habilis  and Homo Erectus,   
Made a plan, drew up a prospectus,  
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools,    
To build up a triangle with four sides, those fools,  
Called it civilization supplanted a nation,  
Them poor Jews got the short end of the stick,  
Working for Pharaoh without compensation,   
Not to mention that time when a prick,  
Called Adolf went crazy and said they were lazy,    
Let’s kill ‘em all won’t that be a gas.  
Killed a bunch of other people too,  
But Russia turned into his own Waterloo.  

Adam and Eve covered up with them figs,   
Then Allah told Islam "Yo, don't eat pigs",  
You got your Greeks who weighed gold shit in the bath,  
Then running out naked to make bitches laugh,  
And Romans like Julius who would throw a fit,   
Whenever goddamn epilepsy hit,  
Ghengis a Khan like in Star Trek but worse,  
Loved stichin' your vag closed like it was a purse,  
Later the Spanish and English Armada,  
But no one invited Eric Estrada,  
Chips motherfucker the game's about done,  
The U.S of A 'bout to drop that bomb.  
No matter tho' 'cos we'll buy their Toyotas,  
To drive to the movies and speak like we Yodas.  

Well what can I say for the human race,  
To make you not kill us with deadly rays?  
Gimme a second I know I can find,  
Just one bastard who was always kind,  
Like Gandhi who told us to lead by example,  
Walked a few miles, got salty, and flew off the handle,  
Beat his wife and kids up using a sandal,  
No wait, to this guy no one holds a candle,  
King had a dream that worked for us all,  
But shit he went and stuck his dick in crazy,  
That one time at the orgy where white bitches came,  
All over his dick like moths to a flame,  
Teresa, Mandela, Tutu them all,  
Had some kind of fuckup that made them fall,  
See,the best of our best is not good at,  
All, so go ahead dog, go shoot your gat,  
‘Cos being human ain't worth a shitsplat.
