"What the hell?" I said to myself while clutching my face.  To think such a small paw could do so much damage.  White with black trimming and razor sharp nails.  "I said MOVE!" the cat said with a hiss.  "Fine, I'm getting up.  Jesus.  Let me at least put some pants on."  The cat rolled it's eyes.  "If you must, but be quick."  I grabbed my jeans and questioned my sanity as it was sinking in I was speaking to a cat.  A cat I didn't even know.

I left the house following this ferocious feline down the walk way.  She kept running faster and faster yelling for me to keep up.  I was just about to give up, but then I saw it.  A 5 car wreck with the lead car obliterated between the 2nd car and a lamp post.  Then I noticed the third car.  My brother's 1999 Toyota.  It was unmistakable.  I rushed towards the car.

There he was, bruised but alive.  "Hey little brother" he wheezed as he saw me.   "I think I may have gotten into a little fender bender".  I sighed in great relief that he was alive. "You never can do anything small can you" I replied.  "You know me, of course not."  I could hear the sounds of ambulance sirens announcing their impending arrival.

He coughed up a little blood and asked me how I found out so quickly.  I was about to reply but then I noticed a cat paw dangling from his rear view mirror.  White with black trimming.  I felt it and sure enough, it had razor sharp claws.  I've always been a man of science and believed in rational explanations for things, but this time... I couldn't think of one.  "A little cat told me" I said as he was being moved onto the gurney.
