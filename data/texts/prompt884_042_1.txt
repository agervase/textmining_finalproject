Sleeping. I am awake. The Human has returned. I am still caged. I am hungry.


The Human has another with him. He will kill this one. Any he brings he kills. 


He wants me to see. He wants me to see he is a killer like me. Like a son.


I don't know how long I have been caged. I am forgetting before the cage. I need to leave this cage before I forget how to hunt.


I would hunt. I would hunt anything at first. Then I would only hunt humans. I would let them think they were following me. Hunting me.


When I killed them they were quiet. They never saw me. Sleeping or awake. Or they were afraid. Their fear made them taste bad. The others I ate.


I would leave when the humans came looking for me. When humans began coming to the places where I killed. Looking for who killed them. I knew it was time to leave.


I did this for so long. Leave when the humans came to the places I kill humans. I was young and then I was old.


And then they caught me. I should have left. Getting old makes you tired of leaving. So I came back to a place I killed. Where humans were.



I waited for the humans to sleep. But one didn't. She was waiting for me. She was a Hunter. 



She made me sleep, and put me in a cage. She took the cage to the Human. The killer that wants to be a hunter. But he is not.


The Human has another with him. He will kill this one. Any he brings he kills.


I am still caged. I still eat the others the Human brings. I am old. I will hunt. 


Not sleeping. I am awake. The Human thinks I am sleeping. He brings another to feed me, dead, their fear will make them taste bad.


I wait. My eyes are closed. My back is to the human. I am too far away from the door of the cage he thinks. I am asleep he thinks.


I can hear him. I can smell him. He is in the cage. Â 


He doesn't know how quickly I will move.


He doesn't know how quietly I will strike.


He doesn't know I am hunting him.


When I kill him he is quiet. Open mouth. Open eyes. Fear.


I am hungry. The Human and the other will taste of fear. I leave.


There are humans to hunt. Humans who will never see me.
