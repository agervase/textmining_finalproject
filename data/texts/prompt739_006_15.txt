I consider myself the truly last human, not like these machines, after all humanity isn’t about perfection.

At my early age I felt like I wasn’t enough for this world. I always felt like I was in a disadvantage and many times I wished to be back to my frozen pre-existence. I grew and so my fears and the sensation of loneliness, for many years I was a stranger, an outsider, despite my age I was still an infant, I froze in fear at every confrontation, “How can you be so stupid?” my classmates repeated each day and many times I overheard my parents discuss how of disappointment I was. Each word a stab in my heart.

One day something broke inside of me.

I tried to change, to become like them, to “Evolve” I called it, I tried to be flawless, I worked out to be as strong as them, I studied hard to be as smart as them, I worked my ass off to challenge them, but every broken bone, broke my spirit, every misspell, a tear, and every laugh echoing thought my head, taunting me, making me suffer.
It is not my fault.
I grow tired of everything, of everyone, of life itself.
I wanted it to end.
They wanted me to end.
And then. Salvation

After reading the history of "the old word" the works of philosophers, poets, mathematicians and everything in between, I realized that the “new world” has forgotten about feelings, writing them as nonsensical and not important. The flaws that made each person unique are gone, individualism is gone, identity is gone.

It is not my fault.
It’s this world fault.
They are all part of a machine. Merely cogs, at this age a name is meaningless as what society value the most is the series of number attached to a name.
Now I remember what I suffered with a smile. My struggles were mine. In this world where I didn’t have anything I have myself.
What’s more human than that
