I was minding my own business in a small highway town. Just putting some gas in my truck, when I felt that tingle on the back of my neck. The tingle that meant someone was targeting me with a spell. Or that I was in the area of a large-scale (and usually explosive) spell. Either way, bad news.
Damnit.
I wasnt planning on surfacing for a while yet, especially not here. How did someone find me? Yeah, I had The Microphone of Steve Harvey in the back of the truck, but there were enough illusions and wards in place to keep Merlin from being able to find it.
DAMNIT!
Okay, where was this guy? He had to have been rapping for a minute or two now, to get a lock-on on me. So where was he skulking?
I muttered a few lines of my own, and my infra-red vision kicked on.
There he was, crouching behind those two dumpsters over there. He had gotten to the chorus, and wasn't slowing down.
Shit!
This guy wasn't playing around. There weren't many spells that required a whole song, and all the ones I knew of ended up with a very dead target.
He was already 2/3 of the way through.
Heh.
This is gonna be interesting.


There was a flash of magical expression; song and sound made manifest, and a heavens-shaking explosion. The fabric of reality and the mist of imagination collided, twisted, rolled together and smoothed out again.
Silence fell.


I stood up and dusted myself off.
The crater that used to be a pair of dumpsters still glowed around the edges.
I finished filling my truck and pulled out onto the highway. My cover was momentarily blown, but I could disappear again. I laughed smugly to myself. You would need more than one puny rapper to take down a former auctioneer.
Dumbasses.
