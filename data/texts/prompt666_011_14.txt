“Wander not, child of night. Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes,” Ren sang quietly. He dug his fingers into a boulder and slithered down it to the spongy ground cover below. “Fear the ghosts burning bright, who come to steal your sight tonight.” Winding his way through the fallen rocks, he ducked inside the youngwood ahead, slipping between the skinny trunks. As the trees shuddered and shook, Ren reached up with the corner of his shirt to wipe away the water that fell to his face from the skinny leaves. 

Ren loved the forest. He loved the pale, dusky light that filtered through the leaves and vines, he loved the rustle of animals and the squish of mud under his toes. 

He looked up at the sun to check his direction. *Water is west*, Nana’s voice echoed in his mind. *Water is west, and water is best.* 

Ren could never remember the next verse of the song. He knew it started *Cry not, child of night,* but was the next line the *beasts that quake* or the *blood that burns?*

(“Ren, please don’t sing that song,” Mam told him. “Don’t scare your sister.”)
Ren scowled. And then the ground fell away.

The dirt and rocks crumbled under his heel and with a shriek, Ren grabbed frantically for a handhold, a vine, anything—

*Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes…*

A searing pain in his arm, a twist of his ankle, and Ren tumbled down hill with the rush of dirt and brush and who knows what else. Each impact drove air from his lungs. He scrambled for purchase as dust and grit coated his eyes and mouth and if he could just *slow down*…!

Before he had time to process anything, the slide stopped.

Ren lay gasping for breath. His chest hurt, his leg hurt, his arm hurt. How could he have been so *stupid*? He *knew* how dangerous a youngwood could be; didn’t he explore them often enough?

Slowly, he eased himself up to a sitting position. He had to take stock of himself; could he even walk on his leg? Could he even make it back to Nana and Mam and Tip before sleep?

He blinked rapidly to clear some of the grit from his eyes. And then he saw it.

A lake. A huge lake with a monolith stone tower, rising from the lakebed, covered in glow-moss and carvings and *what was it*?

Ren grabbed a nearby branch that had been a fellow casualty of the mudslide and clambered to his feet. Before he knew it, he stood at water’s edge. There wasn’t just a tower. It was a stone *village*, bright green and effervescent blue in the murky dark of the water. 

*Fear ground that shakes, and sinking lakes, fear the ghosts burning bright, who come to steal your sight tonight…*

Ren rubbed more vigorously at his eyes to try and clean them of the dirt and sand. His hand dropped; a flash of silver and white, gold and light, in the water, filtering between the stones.

There was something *in the water.*

*Ghosts burning bright, come to steal your sight tonight…*
