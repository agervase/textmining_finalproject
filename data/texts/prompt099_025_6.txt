#The Man Who Never Was

&nbsp;

After the Title war of 2027 communities collapsed and societies fell into groups, clans of sorts. At the beginning, people named their children for the professions they wanted their kids to have. From Plumbers to Doctors, you could choose the fate of your bloodline. But what happens when there are too many Doctors? What happens when there are not enough electricians or not enough soldiers? Collapse? War? Chaos? It's hard to say what happened really. It was all a blur according to my parents.

&nbsp;

"The Event" as it is simply ^^1 referred to as, was the recorded moment that people started gaining skills about things they had never learned. Languages never spoken and complex theories never thought. Within the month, nations had made the correlation between mind and title. That's where it all started to go down hill. Ten years is what it took, and by the sound of it, I'm surprised the world lasted that long. The world fell through, titles began grouping together and then resources began shortening. It wasn't long until governments abandoned their posts and nations flags began upturning. The world as humanity had known it, had gone. Everything had changed.

*Year 2053 (Present Day), USA, Jordan Territory, Road shack Diner*

&nbsp;

Then there was me, the one nobody had thought about even considering. In a world filled with polluted thoughts and great abilities I stood, an outsider.

*Ding!*

The Diner door opens and I am met with a room full of grumbling patrons, the Jordan's where known to be quiet neutral to the territory wars, and were only hostile when threatened. Most titles where allowed here. I sat down on a stool by the counter.

&nbsp;

"What can I get ya?" The man behind the counter said with a grunt whilst leaning against the coffee machine, reading his old world news paper.

"Reading of the the old days?" I ask.

A chuckle comes from the mans mouth as he puts the paper down.

"A coffee please... Jordan?" I'm met with a nod.

"And some of that pie please, too." I said, looking forward to my meal.

&nbsp;

"Sure, son. What's ya name, by the way?" Counter top Jordan asks.

The Diner all sits up from their slumber as their interest peaks.

&nbsp;

I let off a minor laugh.

"Don't worry, Jordan, I'm not hostile if that's what you're asking. I'm a nomad of sorts." He seems reassured enough with my answer and begins walking towards the kitchen.

"So it's like that is it?" One of the patrons asks.

I nod and look forward waiting for my pie.

&nbsp;

The Diner is pretty much like your classic roadside Diner, except darker, due to only using natural light and candles to preserve generator electricity. A counter sits at the end of the room with stools, colour schemed a dark worn out red. The floor is tiled white and black and the shutters are worn and broken. There is a slight amount of dust in the air and the mid day sun shines bright into the room.

"Twenty four UC" Counter top Jordan says, catching me off guard as I begin to day dream and think about my journey so far. I thank him, reach into my pack and pull out the credits.

&nbsp;

I hand over the money and start digging into my pie and taking the occasional sip on my coffee whilst thinking about where I'm heading next. Or whether or not I should head anywhere at all.

&nbsp;

*Three minutes later*

*Ding!*

&nbsp;

"So I heard her squirm and beg and I'm not letting up!"

"Ha ha, dumb bitch. Wait, who's in your seat, Paul?"

Ahh, the Paul's. They're known as the more violent ones around here. Bandits if you where. Their skills consist of hunting, driving and accountancy, from the old world.

&nbsp;

"Sorry fellas, I didn't know this was your spot, let me jus..."

One of the Paul's pushes my shoulder back down into the seat. They weren't about to just let this go.

"No, no, it's ok brother. You clearly think you're important enough to take *my* seat." He has a grin on his face now.

I let out a sigh and begin eating my pie once more.

"What? You're just gonna ignore me, boy? What's you're name anyway?"

&nbsp;

I take a sip from my coffee.

"I said don't ignore me!" I felt the air pass by my head, he raised his hand to strike me. Everything was moving in slow motion. Everything was and was not. Between the sip of my coffee, the dust in the air and the look on counter top Jordan's face, everything was just... At peace.

I slammed my coffee down, spun around and grabbed his arm.

&nbsp;

"Listen here. I just wanted to enjoy my pie and my coffee in peace. Walk away." I looked into his eyes and saw anger brewing up. You see, it's not his fault, it's his predisposition. He had no choice really, he was built this way. He had no unique personality or unique outlooks. He... Just... Is Paul. That's the way it is. The way it will always be.

&nbsp;

His friend raises his bat, I exhale and everything goes dark. A bat, a gun, his face and Jordan's counter top. Was it seconds? Or was it hours? I don't know, I can't say that 'It all went so fast' or 'I had no choice', because unlike everyone else here. I do have choice.

&nbsp;

"What did you do!" Was the first voice I was met with. I looked to my left to discover it being counter top Jordan's.

"One second, you were over there! Then the next minute you were over there! What... No... Who are you?"

&nbsp;

You see that's the thing about having rules based on a name...

"Me?..." I picked my pack up, stepping through the blood and mass that was once two Paul's.

&nbsp;

"I have no name."
