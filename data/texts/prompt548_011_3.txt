After years of searching, Kohzlu the Necromancer discovered the Tome of Xandor, God of the Underworld. It was hidden in the Inner Sanctum of the Blood Mages, the first servitors of Xandor.

The book contained the secrets of blood magic. Rituals long-forgotten and spells that supposedly died with their creators hid themselves deep within the Tome's pages.

With the Tome of Xandor, Kohzlu would become the most powerful necromancer in the history of Tornalum. For years he has prepared for this moment, and he was determined to get this *perfect*. Blood Magic was a fickle thing, and one mistake could lead to the complete destruction of Tornalum, or even the universe. 

Throwing caution to the wind, Kohzlu decided to summon a demon. Book in hand, Kohzlu began his preparations. As he was setting the scene, Kohzlu muttered the instructions to himself.

*"...a vial's worth of goat's blood arranged in a pentagram..."*

*"a candle at each of its tips..."*

*"...to be done in an open area..."*

*"...must be performed at dusk..."*

After finishing all the necessary procedures, dusk  had settled upon the land. Kohzlu nervously licked his lips as he prepared himself to say the words. He checked the Tome one last time, took a deep breath, and then bellowed out the words with complete conviction and force.

**"Qegrmb, ved ez hrl pjdlgegbd mjd ez dmgcjlii, fgnjv zeghr m blaej eghro ez oepg fbliinjv!"**

The ground shook, and the pentagram started to glow a scarlet red. The sky turned into an inky black and green bolts of lightning struck the pentagram with the force of a thousand suns. The explosion knocked Kohzlu back and almost deafened him. When he recovered from his shock, the smoke began to clear. In the place of the pentagram was a crater, and in the center of it was...

**_A LEMON?!?!_**

Kohzlu couldn't believe his eyes. He blinked and blinked, thinking that the lemon was just a hallucination. Yet no matter how many times he blinked, the lemon remained.

Kohzlu cursed himself and the Blood Mages. He was right from the start. 

*All this talk of Xandor and Blood Mages with their Blood Magic was NONSENSE! All these years of studying in isolation had been for nothing. I should have stopped the moment I-*

His thoughts were interrupted when the lemon started to... levitate? To Kohzlu's disbelief, there, in the center of the crater, the lemon was hovering a few feet above the ground. He would have dismissed it as an optical illusion if the lemon didn't start SPEAKING!

**_"Necromancer Kohzlu... why have you summoned me?"_**

The only sound Kohzlu could make was a pathetic squeak.

**_"Necromancer Kohzlu... do not be frightened. I am Xandor, God of the Underworld and of Darkness. I have deemed you worthy of my power. "_**

Kohzlu still couldn't believe it. *This* was Xandor? A lemon? Out of all the things Xandor could be... Xandor chose a lemon as his body?

**_"I see. Silence. Well, since you obviously don't want to talk, I'll just be on my way now. Farewell, Kohzlu."_**

The stunned necromancer looked on in shock as the lemon levitated away from him and towards the nearest town. Kohzlu went back to his home to process the day's events. 

Kohzlu arrived at his house, still in shock. He sat down on his bed and tried to calm down to no avail. Eventually, he fell asleep.

A few days later, Kohzlu heard news of a floating lemon causing destruction throughout the kingdom. Reports say that the lemon commanded an army of demons, and that the lemon could "fire beams of light from its very being, vaporizing anything that it touches".

The only thing Kohzlu could think to himself was

*Oops.*
