"Sweetie, listen to your father," she pleaded.

"Son, do you know how your mother and I got this far?" His father asked pointedly as he waved his spoon in the air.

"Ugh, not this again..."

"Your mother and I got where we are by settling. We had a government sanctioned union, had the government required number of offspring, took those splendid government jobs, and look at these tasty rations we have every single night to thank for it," his father continued, gesturing now to the food on his plate. 

Ron had heard this speech so often he could recite it himself. Every time his parents got a whiff of his aspirations, every time they heard him make a side remark about changing the world, or fighting for the underclass, they started up again. 

"Sweetie, we love you and we want you to have a future just like this one," his mother looked at him with eyes that spoke of worry.

"Forget this nonsense about resistance! The only thing you should be resisting is the urge to make an ass of yourself and devastate your mother," his dad raised his voice.

Ron knew it was no use. Having a disagreement with his father was like yelling in an echo chamber- everything he said his father would repeat in a cynical and interrogative tone. 

He calmly set down his napkin and left the dinner table, his food untouched. He knew what he needed to do and he knew his parents were too brainwashed by the regime to understand the need for change.

His mothers eyes welled up as he walked away. 

"Now, now dear. It will be alright," her husband tried to reassure her. "Maybe we talk to Cathy, get him a summer internship laminating government declarations. That should knock some sense into him."
