I open my eyes. The world is too bright, so I start crying loudly.

“Hush little baby,” someone sings, “don’t say a word. Mommy’s gonna buy you a mockingbird.”

I like her voice. What’s a mockingbird? Something flashes across my vision, but I don’t know what it means. *A large bird sits on my chest. It has a sharp beak and blood-red eyes. It’s trying to peck my eyes out. I scream, No, No, but it keeps going, keeps going.* The vision goes away.

“And if that mockingbird won't sing,” she continues, “Mommy’s gonna buy you a diamond ring.”

I giggle and clap my hands. I decide I like her very much.

I like Ms. Gardner’s classes. She lets us play with toys sometimes. My favorite toy is the trains, which go real fast on the wooden tracks! But today, Timmy got to the trains first. Timmy is a mean boy. A real bully. He’s not going to share the trains.

But I really wanna play with the trains. And Mommy says I shouldn’t be afraid of bullies.

I take a deep breath and walk to Timmy. “Timmy, could I play on the trains with you?” I ask politely. Timmy’s face turns red. He glares at me angrily. I’m scared – he looks like he’s going to hit me. All of a sudden, something flashes in front of me.

*“Here, take it,” I say.*

*“No, sir, I couldn’t possibly–”*

*I stuff the note into the homeless man’s hand. His leg was amputated below the knee. Beside him slept two young children. “Buy some toys for the kids,” I say, giving him a wink.*

The vision fades away. I stand there, dizzy. *What just happened?*

Just as Timmy was about to throw his fist at me, Ms. Gardner walks past. “Ah Timmy! It’s so nice to see you playing with other children!” Timmy quickly hides his fist. He glares at me and stomps away when Ms. Gardner’s back is turned. 

I have the trains all to myself! Yay!

The snow storm slams into my face, like waves crashing against the shore. Cold, biting waves.

“Jenny, are you okay?” I shout against the wind.

“Yes, yes, I’m fine,” she breaths, hanging from my back. She’s very ill, I can tell. We’ve been out in the cold for days, lost in the woods. A romantic camping trip gone very, very wrong.

I drag my feet across a heavy blanket of snow, more than five inches deep. We haven’t eaten in more than a day, since we ran out of food. We can’t survive much longer.

“Who’s out there!” someone shouts. I raise my head to see a blurry silhouette past the snow in the distance. A large man, carrying an axe.

“Help!” I scream, my voice hoarse. “Help us!”

Thank god, the man hears us. His silhouette sharpens as he rushes towards us. I see his big bearded face and large, warm eyes. There’s a deep scar between his lips and nose. I am instantly reminded of a dream I had last night during a fitful night’s sleep.

*“Come in,” I say. “Don’t be afraid.”*

*“Honey! We can’t just let any one come into our house!” My wife shouts.*

*“Dear, we have more than enough to spare. There’s a raging storm outside! And he has a child, for god’s sake.”*

*“Fine, but I want them out of the house by tomorrow,” She storms away.*

*I guide our guests to the radiator beside the sofa. I kneel so I’m eye level with the little child with the cleft lip. “I really like to play with trains,” I say softly. “Would you like to play with my old trains?”*

The bearded man waves at us. We’re saved.

The man levels his gun at me.

“We don’t have anything else. We’ve given you all we have,” I say, my hands in the air. “Please let us go.”

“No,” he glares at me, his eyes wild. “No! You’re lying! Stop hiding it!”

“At least let them go,” I turn to face my wife and daughter. They’re terrified. “Please,” I beg.

“I’m going to shoot… I swear, I’m going to shoot!” The man is crazy.

I close my eyes, begging for a vision. Visions that have saved me over the years, when the world just seemed to conspire in my favor. *Please, God, if you’re there. Please.*

Then, a vision:

*We’re in a jungle. It’s deathly quiet. We sneak up behind what appears to be a camp. The team leader raises his hand – the signal to move.*

*We swiftly move into the camp, taking the rebels inside by surprise. We take over the camp in minutes. Suddenly, there’s a movement in a tent beside me. I spin around and before I knew what I was doing, I fired three shots into a young man. He was hiding in the tent with his family.*

*His wife beside him screams in agony. She jumps towards me, her eyes wild. “Ma'am, sit down immediately!” I shout at her. She ignores me. “Ma'am, if you take one more step–”*

*She's a meter away from me. I fire two shots into her head.*

I killed an innocent woman.

I remember - in the corner of the tent was a large bird with a sharp beak and blood-red eyes.

I hear two loud bangs. Then, darkness.
