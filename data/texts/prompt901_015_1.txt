*I wake up, groggy, and wipe the sleep from my eyes. I take a look at my surroundings - miserable light blue walls, harsh ceiling lights, a solid pink door, and a window with pink curtains to match. I can see it's daytime through the blinds in the window.  I'm laying down, an IV drip in my arm, a lamp to the left of me.  There's a tall plant beside the window and some balloons attached to it. There's an Etch-a-Sketch nearby, do I even own one of those? The TV is on, it looks like the news. I'm in a hospital room. How did I get here?*

*I have to pee.*

*There's a bathroom in my room, so I get up and go to it. Whilst relieving myself, I hear someone come in. Two someone's. Women.*

Woman 1: Alright, whadyou do with him? 

*At this point I was done, so I flushed and stepped out precariously into the unknown scene before me.*

*I see two women in the room.*

Woman 2: Oh! You're awake! 

Woman 1: Look at you! how do you feel? 

*Who *are* these people?*

Me: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay. 

Woman 2: You look good! 

Me: I feel good. ...Who are you?

Woman 2: Oh, sorry. 

Woman 1: I'm Phoebe Buffet.

Woman 2: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.

Phoebe (Woman 1): Well, we both have.

*Do I know these two? My memory is foggy, but I feel like I've seen them before...*

Me: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?

Phoebe: Well, actually it's just from me.

Monica (Woman 2): I got you the foot massager.

Phoebe: You know who shaved you? That was me.

*I remember now, I won the lottery! I think I was headed to cash in my ticket when something happened...*

Monica: I read to you.

Phoebe: I sang. [To Monica] Hah!

*What the hell?! These women are crazy...*

Me: Well,... thanks.

Monica: Oh, my pleasure.

Phoebe: You're welcome.

*I need to get rid of these people.*

Me: So. I guess I'll see you around.

Phoebe: What, that's it? 

Monica: 'See you around'?

*Yes, that's it. Who even are you???*

Me: Well, what do you want me to say?

Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? Admit something to me? 'I'll call you'? 

*I'll say whatever will get rid of you the fastest!*

Me: Alright, I'll call you.

Phoebe: I don't think you mean that.

*No shit!*

Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe.

Phoebe: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.

*As they walked out, it all clicked! I was crossing the street, and those two women whistled at me! I turned around and then boom! - lights out. I must've been hit by a car or something... wow. Where's my lottery ticket? I never got the chance to cash it in.*

*A nurse walks in.* 

Nurse: Hey! You're awake! This is great news! How do you feel?

Me: Good, actually. I think I remember how I got here now. Can I have my clothes?

*I must've left the ticket in my pocket.*

Nurse: Sure, I'll be right back. Don't move around too much, you've been out of it for a while.

*A few minutes later, she comes back with my clothes.*

Nurse: I'll give you a minute to change, then the doctor will be in to run some tests.

*I thanked her as she left, and changed into my clothes. I checked my left jacket pocket.*

*Nothing.*

*My right pocket?*

*A few dollar bills, but no lottery ticket.*

*My pants pocket then, must be in one of those! *

*I checked them all, but nothing was in them besides my wallet and some gum. *

*It was at that moment that I started to pick up what was being said on the TV. I turned up the volume.*

News Reporter: We're here now with Jacob Alanis, the man who found a lottery ticket lying on the street and picked it up to discover it was worth $20 million! Jacob, what do you plan to do with your newfound fortune?
