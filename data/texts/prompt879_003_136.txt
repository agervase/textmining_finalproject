"You have one wish. Consider it carefully. Speak when you've chosen."  
  
I frowned. Wealth? Immortality? Youth? Love? Susie? I haven't seen her since New Year's. We left things in such a bad way, it's no wonder she tried so hard to avoid me. Okay, *I* left things in a bad way. Shouldn't have spent so much time around her sister, fully-clothed or otherwise.  
  
Focus.  
  
I looked up to the genie, who had a look of angry boredom on his face. I wish he wouldn't look at me like that. Genies can read minds, right? He's probably annoyed that I don't have any creative wishes. But Susie... I could make her love me, maybe. Or Anne. I still miss Anne. Beth, too. I think about her a lot when I can't sleep.  
  
So much of my life was spent around these women, and I screwed it up every time. Could the genie fix it? Fix me? I only have one wish to fix everything, what can I ask? Who would make me happiest? Susie? Anne? Beth?  
The greedy part of his brain suddenly decided to contribute: your biggest screw-up would be the one that caused the best relationship to end. Simple. Elegant - even the genie would be able to appreciate this.  
  
"I wish to change my biggest mistake." The genie grinned. I suddenly regretted picking up the lamp.  
  
"As you wish!" the genie shouted, His voice grew distant, and I felt my consciousness pushed back through my life, and I could see my past fly before me. There went the genie. There went... no, the genie's still there. Oh. Oh no.  
  
Before I could protest, I felt the words being pulled out of my throat: "I wish you wouldn't look at me like that."  
  
*Fix*. I wish I could *fix* my biggest mistake. What good was changing it?
