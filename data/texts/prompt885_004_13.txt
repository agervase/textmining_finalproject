I'm doing mine as a Martian mission instead, cause I blanked on the colony part.     

The year is 2035 CE, just a few days after the joint [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) - [ESA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) - [JAXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA) crew of the [Kermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermes_\(dye\)) DM (descent module) touched down near the [Utopia Planitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Planitia), a large plain on the Martian surface and where the [NASA Viking 2 lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_2) touched down in 1975. Our motley crew of international explorers of the Kermes IV are undertaking a task of the utmost importance.         



Lieutenant Janet Kim: Over 200 million kilometers from home and I've been digging holes for the past 3 days. I'm starting to feel like [Stanley Yelnats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holes_\(novel\)#Stanley_Yelnats_IV).    

Commander Steven G. Johnston: Just keep digging Janet, we need a solid base before we begin driving these piles in. Plus it's going to be nice to have something larger than a bedroom to move around in.     

Dr. Kei Sugihara: When we're done it'll be bigger than my apartment...      

Dr. Michael von Berg: Except there'll be 5 of us in it... So Janet, after you're done digging that hole want to help me drill for some core samples, ja?        

Lieutenant Janet Kim: Funny...      

Dr. Robert Chowdhury: <radio> Steven it's Bob, do you have a moment?     

Commander Steven G. Johnston: Yeah sure, what's up Bob?        

Dr. Robert Chowdhury: <radio> I think I found a parachute or something.       

Commander Steven G. Johnston: One of ours?        

Dr. Robert Chowdhury: <radio> I don't think so, I'm about a quarter meter deep surveying ground temperatures.     

Commander Steven G. Johnston: Hmm... Sugihara, Kim with me. Bob, I'm making my way over there now.       

Not wanting to interrupt the conversation their mission commander was having Suighara, Kim and von Berg stare at one another to see if one of them had any idea what Chowdhury found but the confused look on their faces made the answer clear. Their commander summoned two of them to go with him over to where Chowdhury had been surveying, the two nod to confirm and wave to their friend who was left behind to continue digging.      

Von Berg had a distraught look on his face and put his hands on his helmet in despair, to which Kim managed a chuckle and Sugihara a wry smile followed by a shrug.        

The trio make their way some 30 meters over to Chowdhury walking as best as they can in their N6C space suits, passing their partially built HLS (Habitation Lab and Shelter) known to the crew as the shed, and pass the DM which they've started to mutually loathe due to it's cramp conditions. They see a small hole that Chowdhury is working at as well as a core drill with it's annular cutter detached and various core samples packed for transport for analysis.     

Johnston: <radio> [JSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center), this is Kermes IV. Chowdhury may have found debris in the vicinity of our landing site, item is fabric-like, possibly a parachute. Wait, over.           

Sugihara: Could it be something from the HLS?      

Kim: Doubt it, we haven't unpacked yet, and Bob said it was buried.      

Johnston: Ready for some more digging Janet?     

Kim: Spare me, sir.       

Johnston: Bob, what do we have?       

Chowdhury: Not sure, it's not a parachute, too small and it's red.      

Johnston: Hmm... none of our fabrics are red, might be from an old rover or probe. I radioed JSC, it could be some long forgotten Soviet probe for all we know, you check the radiation yet Bob?     

Chowdhury: Yeah, same as ambient. If there is a probe under here it must have been battery powered.     

The four dig away to unearth the unexpected object they found as they wait for JSC to receive their message and to reply back, a process which takes nearly half an hour. They dig carefully like archaeologist to keep whatever they're undigging intact. The entire crew being highly trained astronauts knew better than to damage something potentially dangerous with metal shovels and pickaxes, a [radioisotope thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) if punctured would irradiate the entire area, a battery could burn a hole through their suits.       

The digging went on for little over ten minutes until they've freed their mystery object from the Martian soil.        

Johnston: Is this a joke?       

Johnston holds out a red piece of cloth the size of a bath towel.      

Chowdhury: Wasn't me, it's a pretty elaborate hoax if I've ever seen one.       

Sugihara: Ｎａｎｉ？ ... Ｈａｔａ？     

Johnston: Kei, English. Any ideas.      

Sugihara: My mistake... I think it's a flag.      

Kim: A Roman banner, like from one of those reenactments, maybe we'll find one of those funny hats as well and hopefully [Marvin the Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Martian).       

Johnston: What the hell is this? We dug a one and a quarter meter hole, this damn thing was buried nearly vertically, how'd it even get here?        

Chowdhury: I'm going to send a picture of this to JSC maybe they can make sense of it.       

Sugihara: Very interesting...        

Johnston: What is it?       

Sugihara: It's red.        

Kim: You're right.            

Sugihara: UV light would have bleached any dye from fabric, that's why all ours are white to begin with. The same thing happened to the American flags on the moon, the UV light bleached them white.       

von Berg: Are you guys doing some [Warhammer 40k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000) thing?       

Chowdhury: No, we found it... buried.      

von Berg: And I'm the Martian Cesar.        

Johnson Space Center: <radio> This is JSC to Kermes IV, we have cross referenced your location to all known probes, rovers and satellite crash sites of American, European, Russian/Soviet and Chinese origins there is no known object in your immediate vicinity to our knowledge. Repeat there is nothing out there that we know of. JPL suggests it might be parts of the solar sail from the supply ship that sent the HLS. Over.      

von Berg: Wait... you guys weren't joking?         

Chowdhury: No... we weren't...      

von Berg: What the fuck?        

Kim: What now?      

Johnston: I'm not sure, we wait for JSC I suppose. I wasn't briefed on this situation.       

Kim: Yeah, I could imagine...      

Kim: Space Romans?     

Johnston: Marvin the Martian?      

\*minutes later*      

Johnson Space Center: <radio> This is JSC to Kermes IV, funny picture, please refrain from joking around in official communications. Did the Payload Commander green light you guys bringing that flag with you? We don't have it on our cargo manifest. Over.      

Johnston looks over at Kim who did triple duty as second-in-command, navigator and payload commander, she puts her hands in the air and shakes her head.    

Kim: Of course not, and you've been with me the entire time. I've been digging holes over there by the HLS, not over here.      

Johnston: Yeah, I figured as much. But I sort of hoped that it was you going overboard with a prank. Space Romans...    

Johnston: <radio> JSC, this is Kermes IV. We are not joking. Repeat. We are not joking. Unknown object found buried. Red. Fabric. Approximately 120 centimeters by 240 centimeters. Embossed Latin letters reading Sierra Papa Quebec Romeo. Please advise, over.

And so began the re-purposed Kermes IV mission, a mission originally meant to examine and collect core samples and ice from the Utopia Planitia is now one of many questions with little answers.
