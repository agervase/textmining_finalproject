The beach was quieter than usual. Probably because of the sickness going around during the bleak summer. But not for Jake, Jake was always healthy. He hadn't been sick since got the flu as a child. He was the only person on the beach, but that didn't matter he enjoyed the serenity. He stared at the ocean as its rhythmic pounding against the shore brought him to a sense of peace he had never been to. The wind blew in his shoulder length brown hair. The smell of salt filled his nostrils.
He let out a long sigh as he sat down"what a day." He said to himself still watching the waves. He had just quit his desk job in search of something better. He put his hands to his head and began to worry for his future. "What am I gonna do?" He took his eyes off of the water to check for other people on the beach. He saw nobody, but as soon as he took his eyes off of the water he stood up. 
"What?" He said confused as his body began staggering towards the water against his will.
"No! Stop!" He grunted as he tried with everything he had to stay away from the water. He just kept marching into the waves; sinking lower and lower. His head was almost under the water. He braced himself as his head submerged. His eyes shot open as he kept sinking; walking into his own oblivion. A large luminescent creature swam towards him. It's eyes were coal black, which strongly contrasted to its pale white skin. It had a wide toothy grin of a mouth surrounded by blood. Jake tried again to break the trance that the unobserved ocean gave him. It was to no avail, Jake was drowning and the last thing he saw was the creature opening its mouth. A bright light burst from the back of its throats boiling the water around Jake, and melting the flesh from his bones.  Jakes skeleton floated to the ocean floor as the creature swam away. Neither the creature or Jake was ever seen again as pestilence reaped its silent judgement over the coast.
