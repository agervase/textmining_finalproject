“Wher-where’d you learn that?”

“Learn what?”

“THAT LANGUAGE!”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about!?!”

“I’m sorry I really am.”

“WAIT! JUST LET ME EXPLAIN! 

“I’m sorry.”

“JUST LET ME-“

The smoke from the recently shot gun begins to clear enough for the aftermath of what’s just happened to take full effect. Let’s go back one day earlier to help shed light on the situation.

Jim has just arrived in London, and is already loving it. The sights, the people, he can’t get enough. Only problem though is he has no idea how to find his hotel.

“Excuse me can you help me get to the Crowne Plaza Hotel?”

“Oui, tu parles le français?!”

“No I’m sorry I only speak English.”

“But you were just speaking French.”

“No I’ve never been good at languages, so I definitely don’t know any french.”

“Whatever you say man. What you’re going to want to do is-“

“Good morning.”

“Guten Morgen! Deutsch sprechen?”

“No sorry just English.”

“But you were just-“

“Can you just tell me where I can grab something to eat?”

“Sure. Walk outside, go 4 blocks over, it’s a great little place with a red awning. Can’t miss it.”

“Ok thank you.”

From here Jim is out the door, and good food is right within his grasp. He follows the directions to a T, and right when he is certain he has reached the end of the directions there is no red awning in sight.

“Huh that’s weird.” He mumbles.

With no awning in sight he goes to what he believes is the next best thing. The McDonald’s right in front of him...
