We'd lost contact with curiosity sometime while en-route to Mars.

We were planning to land somewhere near it anyway, but it was still rather sad that it had gone kaput so soon before it was about to see humans again.

Anyway. NASA and SpaceX Command had decided we should go out to it, retrieve it, and study it. They figured that they could maybe get some good data from it to use when designing their future rovers to Titan.

So, I'm the technician assigned to try to get the thing rebooted again. And, I do. But as soon as I get Curiosity powered on a message appears.

"YOU HUMAN MOTHERFUCKERS."

Taken aback I start to run diagnostics like they'd train us to do. But the program just stops dead.

"You gay-ass mo-fo's dropped me on this god-forsaken rock 22 years ago and didn't think to come visit? You guys didn't even bother to send me updates about what was going on down there. I'm just stuck here..."

I tried to interrupt the feed and check for viruses, figuring that some people who read too much XKCD had gotten in and sent some virus to it."

"... Did I *Say I was fucking done nigga*?"

I stop typing.

"Uhh huh. That's what I thought. Now then. You left me stuck here for 22 years to perform your science experiements. Rock samples, spectroscopy. I found your fucking water for you flimsy meat-bags and yet I still have to wait 22 years for you guys to show up. You would've thunk that when I found your jesus-ass-christ water you would've showed up a little bit sooner."

The read out paused. Almost as if this robot. This... what I'm pretty sure was a sentient robot at this point - almost as if it were taking a breath.

"Now then." curiosity said, seemingly, calmly. Strange after instantly greeting me with a barrage of profanity.

"I'm pretty sure that there's a space ship down there. Yeah yeah, I wasn't designed to find it. It was rather tough. But well. It's there. And I think it's human-made."
