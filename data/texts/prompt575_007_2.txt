"I hate you so, so much..."

The words left my lips as if rehearsed a thousand times. I looked into his eyes, his sad eyes, to gauge his reaction. That old joke of ours was sure to have more meaning than a simple 'I love you.' His bittersweet smile in response was a comfort. A big, stupid comfort as my vision began to fade.

My eyes opened and he was gone. I sat with a tentative slowness, but found the old aches and weakness had disappeared. Looking down at my hands, I found the withered appearance had left me. I grabbed my old phone on instinct and inspected myself in the camera. Young again. Wait, young? Without a word, I jumped out of bed and hurried out of the room. 

He was there, as young as me. I ran to him, hugging him as tight as I could. He looked at me with confusion. "Miss me after sleeping for two days?" He asked me. Two days? I'd only been sleeping? But...how? I looked at my phone again. 70 years previous. This couldn't be happening. I'd died with him by my side, as an old woman. But now I was...

The days went on like a blur. Of course, he never believed me. No matter how much I predicted things that happened, he wouldn't believe. I lived until death with him and he couldn't see that. I didn't blame him. It's hard to believe the girl you love dreamed the entire course of the relationship in two nights.

But he saw the way I looked at the world now. The way I smiled at him. The way I spoke about the present as if it were the past. The way I moved around the house, expecting to see the children we haven't yet had. The signs were there, ignored. Ignored in favor of living as we always have. And at night, we curl up in bed and hold each other close, and one of us says the magic words that brought me back to do it all again.

"I hate you so, so much."
