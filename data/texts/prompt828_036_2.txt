Serenity wreathed in flame

traveled down hallowed lane

on gilded trails winding, I couldn't refrain


for the Kingdom had been overrun

demons and sinners, poured over Elysium

the eternal battle had again begun...


I lived life on that Middle plane

as far from other beings as society could strain

and in death, I wanted silence, away from pain


I crawled those cracks between Heaven to Hell

jumped from high roads and from them fell

all with the word that someone did tell


that the fiery bowels are now empty and still

quiet, solace in the embers and silt

Heaven in havoc, noise of demons and angels


And so, went I, down channels in this after life

went I from after-life to after-death, for death's respite

to be where it burned the body but not the ears and mind


but nothing is ever as is wished

through cracks and crags my body was squished

pushed forward toward what my soul's long missed


and to my dismay

upon reaching my heaven prepared to forever stay

my eyes laid upon a figure, a black harmonica he played


unceasingly, persistently, loudly

his song was angry

I pleaded


"For just a moment, remove the notes from the air!

I need only a moment, I think it's fair.

I'll keep you company, make me too a chair


and you keep one soul from up there

forever down here

but for a moment whenever you care


please let us share

a brief unbroken, quiet moment bare

I think for my company, it is fair..."


The figure stopped for just a note

one second or 2, smiled just to tote

"I'm a Satan... you have no hope."


With that he played one resound song,

the realm shook and up came walls strong

cracks cramped and shut, he picked me up with flaming tongs


he sat me down, forever, never alone

no more light from flames had shone

and all I could do was let out a moan.
