“Hey there.” I said through a half forced smile.

You can practice talking to a girl you like all you want. Get the beat of each word right. Get the tone on point. Look up tips on reddit to remain de-stressed. Breath. Remember the practice. But no one prepares you for the unnatural amount of saliva that fills your mouth. I thought: *Why did I put myself through this?* 

She just stared at me. Face as maroon skirt she wore. She had at least five different red-variant skirts. Hardly ever saw her without something red on. I needed to say something. Fast. *What was that pick up line?* “Did you know that ni-”

“You shouldn’t be able to see me.” She squeaked, frantically searching her coat pockets. 

“-nety percent of… I shouldn’t what?” *I shouldn't see her? How could I not see her?!* Strawberry blonde hair. Slender body. Big, water-blue, eyes. Sometimes she wears glasses. On days like today, she must wear contacts. 

“It’s right here.” She muttered, pulling something out of her pocket. Whatever it was, it appeared to be round and smooth. No larger than a bottle cap. Little lines on it. “What happened?” 

“I just thought I’d finally say hi to you. So-” 

“Wait? Finally? You’ve seen me before?” Now I felt like the invisible one. Every weekday for the past month I’ve been no more than fifteen feet from this girl for a half hour at a time. *How was it possible she never saw me?* I fought through the growing pit in my stomach to respond. 

“I… My name is Henry. I take this bus almost every day. Usually sit in the back. You’ve never seen me?” 

She gave her head a little shake. Her hair just landed perfectly back in place. *Even frustration couldn’t disrupt her beauty. God. Why do I even try?* “No. I’ve seen you. But you’ve seen me? On this bus?” 

“Don’t be modest! How could I not notice you?” *Complement! Good! That's the right thing to say!*

Her eyes instantly started tearing up. “I’m so stupid! Idiot!” I have no clue why but I thought it might be a good idea to sit next to her. You know: like any decent human would do. I stretched my arm out and around her shoulders. 

“No! No!” Now she cried so hard the blue from her eyes must have been draining. Bawling uncontrollably, she lean over to rest her face in her hands. 

I gently tapped her back, hoping I could have some positive effect on the situation. After just moments of her crying, she threw that thing in her hand at the wall of the bus. “So stupid! Why can’t I do anything?” She wailed though random sobs. I look at the now fragments and dust that was… *What, again?*

“Hey. What exactly was that thing?”

“I-it w-wa-as-” 

“Hey now. Its okay. What's your name?” 

“A-addie.”

Ever her name was cute! After a few well time pats and some reassuring words, she finally raised her head. Her lovely green eyes were even clearing *green eyes? No. Blue. They were blue. Catching the light weird… Yea.* up. 

“So, Addie. What did that thing ever do to you.” 

“It was a cloaking stone. I obviously fucked up making it.” 

*Cloaking stone? Okay… I can handle crazy. Cute outweighs crazy. Right?*

“I’m sorry. Did you say cloaking stone?” 

She fell silent. Her eyelids receded into her skull as her self loathing turned to panic. Her eyes were definately green. *How did I miss that?*

“I shouldn’t’ve… Fuck. Fuck. Shit. What is wrong with you Addie.” She went on swearing. Pounding her fists against her legs. The seat in front of her. Anything that didn’t shout if hit. *Green. It’s been over a month. You know her favorite color is red. You know her favorite seat. Her hair color. But her eyes. *

I finally interrupted. “I’m sorry. Your eyes. They are… Uh… Green.” 

“What?! Are you serious?” She raised her hands to feel her eyes. “I can’t even Coer Carum right. “ 

*Coer Carum? Green? Cloaking. What is going on?! Leave! Now! Go! Your stop is right… Back there.* My brain was overloaded. “Addie, what the hell are you talking about?” 

She reached over and interwove our fingers. “Henry. You seem like a great guy. I’m really sorry.” She looked towards the front of the bus and nodded. I only caught a glimpse of the driver nodding back in the mirror before I looked back at her. “The Grand Council doesn’t allow Vizts to know about magic. I really am sorry, Henry.”
