Mr. Spook sat on the other side of the desk, looking at me.

A bright lamp was in my face. The interrogation room was dead silent. 

"Um. Hey, man, what's up?"

Mr. Spook slammed his hands down on the table. *plak* "Where were you on the night of Tuesday the twenty-fifth?!" All of a sudden the color drained out of the room and Mr. Spook had a cigar in his mouth and a fedora on his head.

My voice turned cool and mysterious. "I remember it like it was yesterday, on that stormy night-- "

"Oh shit, really? Did you have an umbrella at least?" Mr. Spook lost his fedora and everything was back to normal.

"Nah, dude. Froze my butt off. Anyway, the power went out and I was out back checking on the cables."

Mr. Spook slammed his hands on the table again *plak* and everything went sepia. "Enough small talk, Mr. Gilley!" He reached into his monochrome trench coat and pulled out a black-and-white photo of a little girl. "This here's lil' Sally. Look familiar?" He sneered, barely keeping the cigar between his teeth.

"I 'seen 'er. What's it to ya?" I retorted.

He let out a puff of smoke and held the photo closer. "How do you know who this innocent girl is?"

"Dude, she's my neighbor. Of course I know who she is," I said eyeing at the picture on his phone. 

"Well, that makes sense... actually." Mr. Spook scratched his head.

Eyes glinting in the lamplight, he smirked and swiped left on the phone.

*plak*

In front of me, he was now holding a photo of a stick with a sharp blade at the end. "Well, wadaya know about this, sonny?" Smooth jazz started playing in the room.

My eyes widened and a bead of sweat appeared on my forehead. "I-I-I-I-- That's-- that's a gardening t-tool."

"Heh, kid. Looks like I've caught yo-"

"Wait a sec," I interrupted. Somewhere, a record scratches. "What the hell? This isn't an interrogation. I'm not in cuffs or anything. You're just questioning me!"

"Oh yeah, huh." Mr. Spook replied. "Alrighty then."

I shook hands with him and left. *Phew*
