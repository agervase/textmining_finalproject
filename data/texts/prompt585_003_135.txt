Over the course of the last two days, the tone had changed dramatically at mission control. My eyes burned as I closed them, sucking down another lukewarm coffee. My stomach ached and I wondered if it was the stress, or the Chinese takeout. Probably both.

I stared at the communications log once again "Touchdown successful." "Habitat functional." "Life-support optimal." and I remembered how I pumped my fists when they first arrived.  

That was two days ago.  

By now, most of the team had left. Sandy ordered everyone to go get some rest until a proper plan could be formed, and though most people promised not to go until we heard something, they slowly petered out until only a skeleton crew remained.
The console updated every 30 seconds, and as I slumped into my chair, I noticed the buffering animation took a little longer than usual. Then it appeared.

“Jesus Christ!” It was only a mumble, but Jules must have heard it. He leaned back from his monitor and turned to me. 

“Jesus, fuck.” I couldn’t be sure it was real. “Is this some sort of joke, Jules?”

“What is it?” he stood up and looked over my shoulder. “Somebody call Sandy.”

“It’s just us, Jay.”

“Well get on the fucking phone for Christ’s sake.”

I found her number, hit call, then put it on speaker. The ringing seemed to go on forever. 

Then she picked up. 

“Have they made contact?” Sandy’s voice came through, assertive and clear as always. She wasn’t sleeping.

“Yes ma’am.” Jules replied over my shoulder. “It’s not good.” He put his hand my shoulder. It was no comfort. “Read it out”.

“Ma’am, the response reads: We were wrong. Planet inhabited. Do not send rescue."

Silence. I looked up at Jules for reassurance, but his face was stony.

“I’m on my way.”
