#Title: See The Signs

"Do you feel that?" whispered Samantha. 

"Feel what?" 

The waves weren't so bad that day, outside of Ocean City. Samantha and Leonard liked to soak in the sun off the coast in their yacht when they got the time. Working full time as attorneys didn't always afford them many opportunity to enjoy the ocean much, but today they weren't going to think about law. They were on vacation. 

It couldn't have been worse timing. 

"LEONARD." 

"WHAT," shouted Leonard. 

He got up fast, angry that he couldn't finish his nap. 

Then he felt how sticky it was, and saw all the steam.

"It's way hotter than the forecasts right now," said Samantha. She put her hand out to the water, then retracted it hard. "HOL- Leonard it's BOILING hot." 

Leonard swiped open his phone, and looked up weather forecasts. It read 78 degrees as the high. He checked the current weather at his location. It read 86 degrees. He hit refresh. It read 98 degrees. 

He glanced at his thermometer. It read 110 degrees Fahrenheit. 

"Oh God," whispered Leonard, sweating bullets. 

Leonard watched the bubbling of the water, and saw a dolphin rise up out of it. Then another. And a whole pod of dolphins, a whole school of fish, a whole wealth of ocean life. 

"Something's wrong," said Leonard. 

Samantha looked at her husband in sarcastic surprise. 

"OH well thank you Capitan Obvioso," she saluted him. "You know I didn't figure that out on my own." 

"Samantha okay," said Leonard. He didn't have time to argue. He started up the yacht, and headed back to shore. "We need to get back fast, something's dangerously wrong." 

More ocean life came up to the top, still alive, but badly injured. Badly burnt, boiled alive. Some of them writhed, before they stopped moving altogether. 

Leonard tried to start up his engine. His rutter got to moving, and they picked up speed. They weren't too far away from shore. 

Then a whole new school of fish rose to the top, dying all at once. They made the trip bumpy. He was moving fast, but he had little control. They were still wearing their life vests. 

Drowning was the least of the ocean's threats now. 

"HOLD ON," shouted Leonard. 

More dead fish popped up. A whole mass lining the very edge of the shore, and piling up on the sand. 

"Do you hear that?" shouted Samantha. 

Leonard listened, and heard deep, throaty singing. Like a choir of basses, singing some dark chorus. 

"What is that?" he whispered.

There was a sudden tide rising in the water, and a large being emerging from it. 
Humanoid, and red like muscle. A titan rising from the boiling ocean. 

They saw its lidless eyes, and saw the countless thousands of others emerging in the distance as well, holding swords far larger than aircraft carriers in their grasp. 
They walked forward, towards the tsunami they'd created, singing their deep, throaty song. 

"The tsunami pulled the waters in some, and burned Samantha and Leonard. 
"AhhhhhhhhAHHHHHHH," shouted Samantha. 

"I'm sorry!" shouted Leonard. "I'M SORRY I DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU." 

His arms were red, and burnt. They were taken up by the tsunami, and riding towards the coast on a wave. 

"I LOVE YOU."

"I LOVE YOU."

The tsunami took them over the town, and covering everything in its wake. Far from the titans, the water boiled less, but still burned like hellfire. 

There was a jolt, and they hit their heads on the yacht.

Leonard awakened, and noticed the red, smooth mountain surrounding him. 

He looked beside him, and found the breathless body of Samantha. 

"No," he whispered. He gave her breath, and did chest compressions. He breathed again, and did more compressions. "NO NO NO."

He didn't stop for the greater part of an hour. He shook her slowly when he'd lost all hope, then shed bitter tears on the warm, ocean soaked Earth. It smelled like salt water, and flesh. 

He looked around at the red mountain surrounding him again. 

It looked like muscle. 

He turned to his other side, and saw the pale, orange eye staring right at him. He looked far down the length of its face, and saw the titan's smiling teeth.
