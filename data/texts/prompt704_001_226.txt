Turns out getting bit by the dead wasn't the highlight of my day. Just my luck. I looked out to the people that had become so important in my life, this weird stage of my life that didn't feel like life at all. Jessie caught my stare and rushed over.

"They're here!" She stuck out her bandaged elbow as far as she could, almost hiding her beaming smile.

"I see it, sweety, good job."

"C'mon, you're next!" She dragged me along my good arm and pushed me down on a crate. The medic turned from her supplies and gave me a once over. She looked exhausted. The hour had grown late and I noticed most of the other soldiers were starting to pack up to presumably continue to the next camp. I tucked the sleeve of my sweater and returned my attention to Jessie.

"... and I'll make us a fried egg, you know with bacon and a tomato. I got some eggs from the chickens aunt Mackie hatched last summer. Oh and we can watch tv again! Can Henry come? Henry'll need a place to stay. And a shower, I want a shower so bad... I need a shower so bad." She wasn't even talking to me anymore.

I winced slightly as the needle pricked my inner elbow. The medic frowned and looked me straight in the eye and then her gaze fell on my other arm. I looked down and only then felt the fresh blood staining my sweater. I instinctively covered it with my hand. I met her eyes again.

"... you can drive us to the beach. My mum and dad always drove us to the beach during the summer. Henry'll come too right? I'll try to make a good mixtape for in the car. No peeking beforehand." Jessie noticed the adults staring at her. "Whats wrong?"

The medic looked back at me and shook herself awake. "Nothing, sweety." She took a bandage from her supplies and wrapped it around my elbow.
