"I fucking hate it when you do this," I said.

Adopting a tone she replied,
"Don't use that langauge with me," 
and immediately started in on her hands, which were parked under the table where I couldn't see them. I didn't need to. She was kneading them, wrapping them around some imaginary ruler she kept with her out of a force of habit from when she was our teacher. She would do it whenever something rankled her, and she was rankled now. The way it looked I swear she could still feel the bite of the edges in those soft palms of hers; I knew I could. She started this time when I mentioned Michelle. 

You see, I got this twin. We're identical. We did everything together: ate, slept, pissed, played, fought, we were boys! I remember at night, we'd watch the Dukes of Hazard together and then when it was time to piss, we'd go up in that bathroom, cross our streams to make a big X just like the one on the top of the General Lee. Then we'd scream out, "Dukes a' Hazard!" as loud as we could. It was great! We had the same friends and we were all just a bunch of goofy fools, but Nathan and I? There's no bond that could break that. 

And even though we were identical twins and had all these shared life experiences, there was one way that Nathan and I differed, and it was a big one. Nathan was really girly. The way he'd walk, the way he'd talk, it was.....soft. Just, really soft. He'd talk to the girls, sometimes, like he was one of 'em. Even though I knew it was weird, you know, mainly cause the other guys told me so, but I didn't care. I was actually pretty thankful for it and, I think he was, too. It gave us some space from each other, and it felt right. He was special. We were special. Our home was special.

6:30 wake up call, and for that privilege, we were allowed to start the laundry from the night before. Move steadily to the shower because it's six forty-five, remove your clothes, shower, wash, brush your teeth, then your hair, dress sharp and be seated at the table one minute before seven for breakfast prayers.

Thankfully our mother enjoyed a liesurly pause from fasting and it was a very quiet twenty minutes, followed by a thorough cleaning of the dishes and kitchen. And when we were done, we could begin school.

We dreaded this, both of us did. We hated it. It was the one thing, out of all the things that made us special, that was so glaringly negative. After the kitchen duties, and our hands were really dry, we'd reach out and push open the door to our living-school room.

She would stand there beside her desk straightly. Her eagle's talons clutching the ruler in front of her crisp, dark dress. She would smile and watch us take our places. She glared hardest at Nathan.

She detested femininity in boys. It was a shame and she used every opportunity she got to show Nathan just how wrong he was. It was a nightmare for him. It was a nightmare for me. It was really too much for either of us. The image of our mother standing in front of us, those hands, it will forever be imprinted on our memories. Just like this one.

She stood there before me, in that self-same pose, expectantly. She expected an apology. 

"I'm sorry," I said.

"Good boy," she said. At that point, she turned and strode briskly through the store and out the front door. The sunlight was a flare. The flash flushed my eyes violet and then faded.

Through that fade came Nathan. Nathan was here. Nathan with his normal guy stride, just like when we were kids. His blue button down, somehow happy life.

He smiled as he approached, took one look at the food on the table and said,

"Ahhhhhh, thank you so much for ordering for me ahead."

He took one brief look at me and he knew.

"You've been visited by Mom again, haven't you?"

He reached out to me and I took his hand. I raised my eyes to his. He knew.

"Michelle, it's going to be okay."

{"I fucking hate it when you do this," I said.

"Don't use that langauge with me," she chided, eyeing her hands, perched where I couldn't see them.  I didn't need to.  She was kneading them.  She did it everytime I mentioned Michelle.

&#x200B;

"This is so unfair.  She doesn't deserve this.  None of us do."  I was so angry, but I closed my eyes, took a breath and reached out into the void, hoping to touch a little of the humanity that she possessed.  Nothing.  I left it there to be counted with the food we had been enjoying.

&#x200B;

"He," she said quietly.

&#x200B;

"Mother."  My hand slowly reeled back in.

&#x200B;

"He!" she insisted, staring at me.  "I gave birth to two perfectly healthy boys and that's how it'll stay.  You can tell Nathan that he's welcome any time."

&#x200B;

"You know, mom.  In our chid psych class, we're learning that people develop based on both envrionment and genet..."

&#x200B;

She cut in,  "Oh, so it's my fault now!  I'm the reason.  I'm the one."  Her face blueberried.  "No!"  she yelled, standing.  "I'll have none of this.  This is the most unnatural, most blasphemous.......... thing I could imagine.  My little boy," she wailed.  "A freak!  A Frankenstein!"  she screamed.

She white-knuckled the table and I swore to God that she was about to break it in half.  I could do nothing but sit and watch as the maelstrom worked its way through her.  A few minutes passed, a silence pregnant enough for twins developed between us as we sat there breathing...settling.

&#x200B;

"I made the cut," she reasoned.  "I cannot support this.  This is wrong on all levels and if you know what's good for you, you'll make the cut, too."

I could feel her reach out for me, plead with me.  I stood looking down.  I hated this.  I knew what I had to do.  I went to her, hugged her and headed for the door.  As I opened it she said,

&#x200B;

"Where are you going?  What are you doing?"

&#x200B;

"I'm making the cut," and I closed the door.

\[This is the first thing I've written since High School, so I expect that it won't meet with a lot of people's expectations.  However, I do love writing and am looking to get better, so anything you can offer, would be appreciated.  I know this is a pretty short short story and I'm sure I've screwed up some formatting....?\]}
