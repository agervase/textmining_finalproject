?? - "Where the fuc... am I..."

?? - "HAHAHA, there goes another idiot trying the 'my cell mate is having a seizure, help him please' strategy. Poor soul, little he knows that those big eyed space geeckos don't understand shit he's saying."

?? - "Wait a sec... Where am I... Who the fuck... Hey, is that Jake Black? Why is he..."

JB - "...*eat another chip and suddenly makes eye contact*"

JB - "Wow, can you see me? Are you seeing me right? How can you see me? I though this was my dream... What are you doing in my dream?"

?? - "Dream... What dream? I was sleeping in my bed and... Hey, wait, you are the Tenacious D guy right? Jake Black? Dude you're super funny, love your movies! Remember that one-"

JB - "Wow, easy man, its Jack, not Jake. And yeah, its me, but what are doing here? These supposed to be my Deep Sleep Assisted Reality Experience. So nobody here is supposed to see me, and I should have complete control over everything around. Why can't I delete you?"

?? - "That's weird, I don't know anything about this Deep Sleep Animated Reality shit."

JB - "Deep Sleep Assisted Reality Experience. Man, I'm so gonna have a talk with that shrink when I wake up..."

?? - "So, are you dreaming... Too?"

JB - "Of course I am dreaming! How the fuck do you think I would be able to eat cheetos, while floating around in a goddamn' spaceship full of aliens in the middle of the freaking outter space?!"

?? - "Don't know. Shrooms? Did you licked a frog? A friend of mine did it once, dude almost-"

JB - "I'm not high! At least right now, I'm not..."

?? - "Man, this is the weirdest thing ever... I'm in my PJs locked in a cell, talking with Jake from School of Rock who's floating in the air eating snacks while some hugeass lizards with laser beans are doing an autopsy on a guy........................... HOLY SHIT, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?! AM I GONNA BE OPEN LIKE-"

JB - "Hey dude, chill. My dreams only takes 2 or 3 autopsies each session, and you're Mr. Sixth Guy in Line. By the way, that on the table is Mr. Third Guy. HAHA, check Mr. Fourth and Fifth there trying to scape. Man, that's why I pay for this shit. It's so hilarious."

SG - "Still doesn't explain why I'm here, in the middle of your whatever-experience-"

JB - "Deep Sleep Assisted Reality Experience."

SG - "Fine. And... Not trying to judge or anything, but... Why did you dream about aliens doing autopsies? You could just dream about something more funny and less disturbing, like one of your movies maybe?"

JB - "Why would someone dream about one of my movies? They're not even that funny..."

SG - "Pffffffft. Bullshit. Everybody loves your movies. Like... Kung Fu Panda! And...-"

JB - "I just voiceover the main character."

SG - "Yeah, but is a really nice voiceover, though."

JB - "Right."

SG - "And that other one you're a giant in a island-"

JB - "Gulliver's Travels?"

SG - "Yeah! That one-"

JB - "Sucks so bad. I'll regret it everyday in my life. It's because of this movie I'm in a shrink."

SG - "Oh yeah, it's a crappy movie, sorry... But, don't feel bad man, the kids love this kind of shitty movie. No offense."

JB - "None taken... Do you really think they like it? The kids."

SG - "Sure! I used to like this kind of movie... *before i grow self-conscience*"

JB - "You know, I really do this kind of movie to make people laugh. I try my best everytime they give me a job like that."

SG - "Your feelings towards it it's what counts for, man."

JB - "You're right. Thanks, man."

SG - "You're welcome, dude."

SG - "So... I think you should, like, wake up soon? Mr. Third already looks like my cat after the neighbour's dog thought Mr. Flufflypaws was its midnight snack. Poor Mr. Flufflypaws..."

JB - "Yeah, right, damn. The dog ate the your cat?"

SG - "Pretty much."

JB - "Damn..."

SG - "Yeah... So-"

JB - "Oh, sure. Wake up. Wake up. What time is it?"

SG - "I don't have a clue..."

JB - "Oh yeah, I have a watch. Wait a sec......................... Aaaaand my session is about to end..................... now. Bye, Mr. Sixth."

SG - "Bye, Mr. Black! Nice to meet you! Keep doing the movies for the laughs, man. For the laughs. Remember!"

JB - "Will do it! Thanks for the talk!"
