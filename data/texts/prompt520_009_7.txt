“Shit, I forgot to get milk”
“I need to go out now"
And then, in a surge of slackness, he said
« Fuck it, I am watching west world »
And as he sat down, he found himself watching the air.
At first he thought the wall of his house somehow disappeared, he was in some kind of contraption that had thousands of buttons. A high pitched scream grasped his attention. Next to him, a woman in a white uniform, screaming her lungs out for whatever god damn reason.

“What the fuck happened to my house ?”
Still confused, John tried to get up but was blocked by something, he had a double seat belt, “why the hell do I know have seat belt ?” he said to himself.

And then it dawned upon him, he had teleported in the seat of a pilot while he was out, and... but that doesn’t explain the frantic screaming, it felt so real, definitely not a dream.

“Can you shut the hell up woman ?”
“HHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII”
“Wtf, I can’t concentrate, stop”
“HHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE”
“This is fucking ridiculous”
The woman was clearly crazy or something, waving her arms around like a mad man, it was freaking scary.

The plane was in auto pilot, so he decided he was going to check on the passengers, maybe they knew.
But he had to take the woman so she didn’t crashland the plane while he was out.
The second he removed her bealt, the screaming stopped, “progress” he thought, but she just started to say “Gaga” and suck her thumb.
“This is ridiculous” He said as he was pulling her out, it was harder than usual, like, way harder, he had trouble carrying her. 
“This sucks” pause, do he just strapped the belt back on so she couldn’t wave her arms around and left.

coming in first class, he saw about 50 confused faces, a fight, a lot of confusion and a stewardess trying to open the aircraft doors.

“Fuck”
