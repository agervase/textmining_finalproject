"And now a special announcement from the Government of Canada to the rest of the world."  

An old man appeared on the television.

"Your armies and your schemes have all failed. We didn't want this.  We wanted to be left alone with our hockey and our beer eh.  But you all couldn't leave us be.  You saw how awesome hockey is, and how you always knew how terrible your beer was, and you got jealous.   You had to have it for yourself.  Well that just made us angry.  And everyone knows you don't piss off good Canadian boys and girls.  Because good Canadian boys and girls have heart, and will do whatever it takes to win!  You should have just left us alone with our Maple Syrup and our comedy routines."

The old man was dressed in an outlandish suit and looking like he was worried his time was running out.  He pressed on with his speech.

"We tried to play nice.  Our ambassadors were mocked.  Celine Dion is annoying you said.  Mike Myers was drubbed out of Hollywood for one bad movie.  Ok it was pretty terrible. But the point stands! We learned from our mistakes.  We sent Drake.  And Bieber.  We conquered your youth! 

You sent spies to try and shape our politics.  When that didn't work you sent spies to influence others around us so we would have to fall in line.  Well you saw what that caused.   All that hassle, and for what?  Brexit turned into "Brexshit we didn't mean it."  MAGA turned into "Make it stop".  And so we did, behind the scenes, work to make it stop.  Negotiating here and there, sending in our special First Liners where required, drafting a good goalie and establishing a good defense corps there.  Getting some grinders.  We built a cup winning team!  You saw too late what was happening, and so now here we are.  Now we will have Pax Canadiana.  Sorry."
