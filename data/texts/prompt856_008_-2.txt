I decided to go to humane society to get a cat. I see a small cat in the corner and felt that was the one. I take her to my humble abode and she starts hissing in the direction of the neighbors house.

I say goodbye to my feline friend and go to work. Once I arrive at work I see a whole bunch of people coughing so hard they tear muscles and they are turning blue.
I cannot even pass a patient without this sort of thing going on. So I assume it is an epidemic.

A man is lying on the autopsy table I nod to proceed my colleagues reach for the bonesaw and open up the ribcage the man's lungs are so full of fluid that it has traveled up the trachea. My colleagues look at me and I say: "This is similar to the 1918 flu pandemic." Just like that I stumble out the room outside is a hallway full of people on stretchers or on the floor. I find the phone and call the US ARMY we have had some of their soldiers that had gone to this hospital reporting for flu or if it is flu.

A private reports for influenza he is sent back to his tent. A few hours later thousands of soilders report for flu and some begin to die.

I was dead asleep when suddenly my cat jumps on me and wakes me up 
"Sorry your highness but theres no time to explain, you must follow me." Said my purrsome friend. "Okay just let me sleep first." I said. "Your humanities last hope against the plague!" Said my cat who was not feel-line good.
