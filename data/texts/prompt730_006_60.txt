Italian. Grouchy. Appear to have blown up the old police station. Probably did. 

Traditional. 

Walking up to their door, I try and imagine the worst case scenario. I’m 16, just a normal guy asking out my lab partner. I mean, if the parents are home worst case scenario they send a death threat. 

Or shoot me in the middle of the street. That’s cool. 

Knock knock. They don’t have a doorbell, they still have the metal family emblem on the door. Gotta pick it up and nail it on the door. 

It opens immediately. A massive burly man opens the door  

“Yes? How may I help you?”
“Um...uh... I was wondering if Lotte was here? I’m here to ask her out”
I have no idea how to talk to the head of a mob.
“She is not here. Leave.”
“Yes sir. Sorry to bother. You.” 

I start shuffling back to the street. 
Something hit my head. 
“Motherfucker son of a bitch asshat who the hell threw that?
“I did, James. I saw you at my door. What were you doing? I heard my dad laughing.”
Lonnie was standing off to the side. She must have seen me threw a window. 
“Oh...hey Lonnie-“
“Don’t you mean motherfucking son of a bitch asshat?” She retorted. 
“You know what... just... god damn it. I was gonna ask if you wanted to go watch a movie then catch dinner at Rick’ s shack.” I said. She did that flicking thing with her dark long hair. 
“Sure. Do you mind if we swing by Ronald’s on the way?” She asked. I had no problem with it so 
“Sure.” I said. 
Off to a great start I told myself. Called her asshat but she was okay with that. 
She held my hand. I felt great. Then we saw the guys across the street. 

Big beefy dudes in hoodies. You could see lumps at their hips. Probably some sort of gun. What could be shadier?

“Hey! Carl! How’s it going?” Lotte yells. The biggest beefy dude pulls off his hoodie. I’ll admit, he’s sorta cute. 
Carl casually just picks her up and it transform into a hug. 
“Hey lotte! We got the cash. We’re also thinking of hitting up the bank next to Rick’s later. Do we have your permission? 
“He’ll yeah. I’m grabbing dinner at Ricks later with James here. Do you mind waiting until after that? I haven’t gotten action in a while.”
Well shit. She certainly isn’t talking about a bed.
