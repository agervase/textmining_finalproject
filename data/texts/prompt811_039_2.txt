**I dug into a dark place in my mind to get this. You might want to skip it. It has all the trigger warnings.**

I felt the Call from my lair deep in the outer darkness; a tug at my consciousness. The Master doesn't answer Calls, and so they are left to us, the host of hell to fulfill the bargains that mortals are constantly seeking. Usually it involves petty sins: greed, lust, and the like. It warms my heart to watch humans trade their souls for a single fornication. a moment of passion for an eternity of torment. It's beautiful. These small and petty desires do not make it to my level, though. Lesser demons handle them. It takes something truly vile to attract my notice. I let my essence travel back along the pathway of the calling, curious as to what had drawn my attention. It had been quite some time since I had been called past the veil. This must be something unusual indeed.

&#x200B;

As I entered the circle, I pulled matter over my essence, forming a body like a human would don a suit of clothes. I became a writhing mass of smoke and shadows; constantly twisting and bending, tortuously stretched into the shape of a human. I opened my newly formed eyes of glowing embers, to behold a young mortal. Oh this was unusual. She was under the age of accountability, and should not have been able to summon even the basest imp, much less a Prince of the Outer Darkness. What could have given her the dark emotions necessary to attract my attention?

"***Small human. How did you summon me? You are too young to bargain.***"

&#x200B;

Her voice quavered as she looked upon my form. "I... I found a book in the library. I go there a lot to stay away from him. Please... I need help."

&#x200B;

Just then, I heard the fumbling of a large drunken man coming down a set of stairs. I opened my senses and breathed deeply. I smelled the terror on her. That's how she attracted me: the darkness of a father who has failed in his most basic duties. This would indeed be interesting.

&#x200B;

Time slowed as I looked into her eyes. "***Small human. You are too young to bargain, and as such I am free of obligation, but I will make you a promise. After this day you will no longer be hurt by your father. After this day you will be at peace. Is this what you desire?***"

She quickly nodded yes, her large brown eyes never leaving me. So pure and innocent. Despite the bruises and burns on her, she still had hope that things could get better. How very wonderful. Time resumed its normal pace, and I dropped the cloak of my body. As the drunken man made his way down the stairs, heavy boots thumping on each step, I began whispering to him: suggesting things he'd never thought of before. He got down the stairs and looked upon his daughter in a new light.

"Hey, babygirl" he said as he stared and swayed slightly, "You're growing up so fast, aren't you. You're looking more and more like your mother every day. Come here to daddy."

When he first grabbed her, she screamed, but the screams of fear quickly became cries of pain. The depraved sot was perfectly malleable. He followed my every suggestion. I made sure it lasted until exactly one minute before the stroke of midnight. As she gasped her last breaths, I watched her soul move on to heaven. My promise was fulfilled. He couldn't hurt her any more. One innocent soul lost from our grasp, but we gained so much more in return. As the light left her eyes, I dispelled the drunkenness from her father, and opened his mind to what he'd just done. He looked at himself and his daughter, and it slowly dawned on him what he had done to her. I barely even had to nudge him. He ran upstairs and got his shotgun. I watched in glee as he walked out onto his back porch and sat down. My essence surrounded him and embraced his soul as he pulled the trigger. Normally they fight us as we drag them to hell; this one was racing me to get there. As I'd predicted, this Call had indeed been interesting.
