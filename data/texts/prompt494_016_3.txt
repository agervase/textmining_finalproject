''I mow them down like wheat in a field.''

Death stood over me. Literally flowing with tapestries of dark and woeful silence. It broke the air around him and pulled it in as a black hole pulls in the last light of a dying star. As death pulls the final breath of those who would soon be never more.

''Don't you think that's a little too poetic?''

...

A shimmer crossed the empty pools of deaths eyes. An unmistakable waver in his immense countenance.

''Poetic? You dare, mortal sinner, you dare to mock the bringer of time's end!''

''Well, it's all relative really, I suppose, *time*. Would you mind if I nipped back to my dimension to turn the gas off? My auntie you see, she's not the brighte-''

''How DARE you ask me for a request, puny being!''

Deaths scythe sharpened before me. Piercing itself to an unbearable point, that even light itself could not pass unharmed. A single edge that ripped through precious life and brought even the greatest of men down to eternity and ash. In it's glazed reflection the souls of all before looked back as toddlers pressed against an infinite window.

''Yes, very poetic, that's lovely. I never fancied science much anyway.''

Death raised the implement of torture in an arc, wide and perfected through uncountable downswings.

Death and I stood in stubborn, waiting for the final curtain... ''Oh dear, where am I?'' A frightfully singed lady had appeared beside me as the scythe hung high and ready.

''Auntie! What are you doing here?''

''Well, you see dear, I thought I smelled gas so to calm me down I thought I'd have a cigaret-''

The blade fell, and death collected two more souls that moment, trapped, as death was, in a soulless wander.

Pure poetry.
