I stared at the man. His grizzled features only made his eyes more striking - this man had seen some shit. I felt myself shaking. 

"What the hell was that?" I blurted out, looking at the remains of my wallet. There was a thick, purplish ooze bleeding out of the leather. Teeth lined the edges.

“Better if you don’t know,” he said, looking from side to side, gun still drawn. “I doubt you’ll even believe me, even after what you just saw.”

I stared at the creature that was once my wallet. 

"Try me."

He sighed, putting his gun away. "Ok. But not here. It's not safe."

The man led us into a nearby bar, ordering two drinks before we sat down. I was still shaking, but he was as calm as an ocean breeze. 

"Ever heard of capitalism? Consumerism?" he asked, not a hint of irony in his voice. 

"I believe I've heard the terms, yes," I replied, trying to not sound sarcastic. 

"We're living in a society that worships *things*. Ownership. Materials. Goods, that are supposed to make us so happy. Then why are we all so fucking depressed?"

I said nothing, motioning for him to continue. 

"Well, they're coming alive. There's some kind of global consciousness that's bringing them into power - we're creating them. And they're feeding off us... more and more, they're feeding off our urge for *more*."

"How did you find out about this?"

"The hard way," he replied, taking a massive swig from his drink. "Never been a much of a buyer myself. Feels like I'm the only one that can see it, this virus that's feeding off of us. That's taking over us."

I took some time to process it all. I felt a fear deep in my gut, gnawing away at me.

"How did you know my wallet was one of them?" I asked.

He finished the last of his drink, then stared at me. 

"Son, I'm not sure if you understand - *every wallet is one of them*."

Part II will come soon, if there's any interest <3
