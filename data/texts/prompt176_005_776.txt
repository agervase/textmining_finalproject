The cosmos is relatively easy to meddle with. A swipe of the finger, and you can toss around asteroids or zap a few nebulas into existence.

We set up some ground rules a long time ago. Galaxies have to stay in rough interstellar arrangements. Once you create a star, it has to die on its own. And most importantly, if any living species are discovered on a planet, let them live.

Archie changed the framework of a constellation or two, just to see if anyone would notice. Minerva decided to set Neptune on fire and then fizzle it out, on and off, like a light switch. It was funny for a while, but then it just became another distraction.

One day I caught Dave chuckling to himself. He's always been a bit of a lone wolf, but he knows a few good party tricks. 

"What's so funny there, champ?"

Dave grinned. "Oh, you'll know soon enough."

"Come on. A little hint?"

He tilted his head back and cackled. "All right, all right. Let's just say I put the Sun in Galaxy 672B on its own little trajectory."

"What do you mean?"

"Check the map."

I ran back to the control center and pulled up the chart for 672B. The Sun appeared to be on track to hit the Earth, but not for a while - couple billion years, give or take a few million.

I hate to admit it, but I honestly forgot about it. That is, until I saw Dave muttering to himself at a galactic get-together.

"What's wrong, man?"

He curled his upper lip and polished off a glass of stardust. "The humans on Earth, 672B, are heating up their own planet. Driving vehicles around, spewing waste into the atmosphere. It'll be burned to a crisp in the blink of an eye."

"And what's the problem with that?"

Dave coughed. "Those fuckers ruined my joke."
