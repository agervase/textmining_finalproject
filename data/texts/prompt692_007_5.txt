I haven't aged since forever. My parents are georgous, so it probably runs in the family. It may purely be coincidence, some may think that - *I dont*- but my family all has the same identical scar above their shoulders. Thinking about it just makes my head hurt. It gives me this weird eerie feeling that sorta puts me out of place. Like I don't belong or something. I had a fall when I was climbing a tree. Happened when I was 6. Don't remember much of the experience, but I got a weird looking scar that sorta looks like a wolf bit me. My parents say that on the way down, my neck collided with a very pointy knot. Jagged and sharp. Doctors didn't think I'd walk away without a broken neck, but I crawled. They saw, eyes agape, behind a window that sorta resembled the mirror in an interrogation room. Blood pouring out of my neck. I managed to crawl to my phone, which had fallen about 15 feet from me. At least I *thought* it had fallen. Pretty sure the doctors put it there. Well, I managed to dial 911 and the lady says, "Is he an organ donor?" Some reason, I hear a reply saying, "yes. We better hurry. He doesn't look so good." What the hell is going on? *Ma'am, ma'am!* I start regaining strength and manage to push myself to my knees. I raise my legs up and stand upright. Holy sh*t my neck hurts. I notice the mirror. Well it looks like a mirror.  I walk over to inspect my neck. Blood is oozing out under my hand. I slowly raise it and am shocked to find a clear piece of tape. I clear it off my neck. "CLEAR!"
