I have strange fears, at least strange to me. I fear things that are much too large and much too ominous. Perhaps it's human intuition, perhaps I'm just a pussy. Either one this certain event is scaring the crap out of me.

 I'm a regular guy, I work at Subway and I enjoy my leisure time gaming and browsing the Internet like a good little wash up. And on my time on the internet I have found my fair share of creepy stories and passed them off as bullshit. But *this?*. This is something you'd find in some lovecraftian horror novel or something. Because when your TV that had just been the subject of a freeware horror game and your radio that should be dead starts broadcasting two contradicting commands that is when you start to lose your shit. 

The TV says in bold letters something about stay inside and down look outside. The radio says to get to high ground. And the worst thing is is that neither of these warnings should *exist* in my part of the world. Here in my part of Australia we don't have flooding that's so intense we needs to get to higher ground and we *certainly* don't have any fucking monsters that eat your soul if you look at them. 

I honestly think I'm going fucking mad. Why is there a broadcast for this?! Why am I recording all my thoughts I have onto this fucking phone? Why can't I open the curtains and last but not least, WHY WON'T YOU TELL US ANYTHING ELSE?! The TV is nothing but a fucking flat screen with creepy words on it and the fucking radio keeps repeating the same shit.

I need to tell myself to calm down, I need to get to the bottoms of this. I'm going to open the curtain.
