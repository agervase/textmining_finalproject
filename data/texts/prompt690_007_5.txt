Ding! Ding! Ding!



The bell rang, and so did my brain analyzing the jacked fellow rushing towards me. His breathing pattern emanating anxiety, so an easy push on the stomach would be enough to put him down, like I did with most of my opponents? No! This one is going to be hard, he is approaching me from far right? This strategy is unique, but he is a physics major afterall! Do I happen to have any vulnerabilities in my technique? Maybe, but I don't have any time! He is close!



Looking at his body, his legs, there's just something... idk, off about them? They seem a little unbalanced, I guess the way he exercises he doesnt really do much calves? And it seems like he overexercises the left part a bit too much... Bingo! I finally found a weakness!



A push and I fly in the air, he will obviously use my weight to damage my back, I have to make him land on his weak foot, let's see... I twist my side to the left to make him lose his balance but he brilliantly crosses himself to a position! Putting rotational inertia concepts to good use! We are back to the ground taking our stances! I see in his eyes a hunger to win, but he cant steal my tution money so easily! I try to play dirty and push towards his right leg, to manipulate him into moving the opposite way! BOOM! There is that left leg! I finally have good control on it! 



One twist and its over, but wait! How did he move so swiftly! God, I forgot he knows how to make his incredible flexibility an advantage to his speed! He out of nowhere turns me and pulls a triangle in no time! And uses everything he can to restrict my motion! My limbs are begging for a degree of freedom! I cant move a thing! I finally give in, and there goes my zoology class.
