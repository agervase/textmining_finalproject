Administration forms filled death's vision as he stared at the desk. He picked up a form and put on his reading glasses. A sticky note had been placed further down the paper and it simply read:

"He's at it again :("

Death didn't even need to look up at the name on the form. He knew all too well who was at it again. As if on cue a cheery man with a Hawaiian shirt and thick rimmed ray-bans sauntered into the office.

"Simon you utter bastard." Deaths voice was echoed and stern, a bit like every school principal in the universe talking at you at once.

"Hello there my old skip and biscuit!" Simon's cockney accent had already started to get on Death's nerves. He plonked himself down in familiar leather chair and suppressed a small laugh as he felt it was still warm from his last visit.

"Do you know how many forms I have to fill out every time you come here?"

Simon shook his head, annoying smile plastered on his face

Death pulled together a hefty stack of forms.
"This is all you Simon."

"Well, that's not too bad, I was expecting a bi-"

"There's a pile like this for every death."

Simon let out a low whistle.
"At least I'm giving you something to do." Simon chuckled.

Death did not. He instead opened a drawer on the desk and fumbled around until his bony fingers grasped a large metal coin.
"Let's just get this over with."
In one swift motion Death tossed the coin high into the air, spinning so fast it almost looked like a perfect sphere. It fell surprisingly quickly and he caught it with ease, placing it between his palm and the sleeve of his robe.
"Go on, surprise me."

Simon's smile was extremely punchable.
"Heads!"

Death already knew that lifting his hand would reveal a head, but he hoped to all things holy, and indeed unholy, that today would be the day he wiped the smile off Simon's stupid face.
