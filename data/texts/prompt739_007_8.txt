I am in a glass cage. 
Hope melts before my face. 
Tears dig trenches within my being. 

I am emptier than the sunset at dawn. 

There is no feeling like being a perpetual outcast. Nothing that can cleanse the mind of uselessness. I am flawed and nothing can make me whole. 

The first day I was forced into this outlandish existence I held my hand up towards the sun trying to understand how 200 trips frozen could prove myself haggard beyond my own. I am of the same flesh and blood. My heart ticks with passion and light and desire...yet, my hand flailing in the morning sun uncovers my truth. I can see the translucency of my bones. I can feel the notches of my wrinkled skin. I can see the dots blemishing whatever I am. I hate it. 

So I walk through life. Hearing judgments scorn my soul bitter. I will watch as my advances are turned aside for those "perfect ones". I will be that withered being and question how much fight I have left in my heart to be the outcast amongst perfection; never equal and never the same.

5 suns later, the darkness dissolves in a way those fair-skinned trophy-people would never understand. They still see me as that broken and under-developed embryonic mess. They are fucking right. They see my imperfection as infection. I am witty and crafty because of their shit. Their logic is single-scoped. So, I will allow their pretentious logic to ultimately fool themselves silly. I must keep my dirty little secret under wraps. I don't smile. I don't exude confidence. They can't know this.

They can't know that the blemishes of my exterior only strengthens my being. They can't see that my mind sharpens with every dagger they throw at my looks. Their reasoning is limited to perfection. They won't understand that when the time comes, my wits will dissolve their pretty little features from this earth. I'm the better breed. Just give it 200 trips around the sun...

they'll see.
