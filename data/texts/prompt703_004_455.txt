"Sorry." Death says, "You're friend chose a two-versus-too game."

"Hang on a minute..." I say "How did you do that?"

"Do what?" Satan asks.

"That thing where you misspell words as you're saying them"

"Damn." Death whispers.

"Fuck!" Satan exclaims.

Satan raises an eyebrow, looks at The Book and says "Your not kidding about this one!"

"You just did it again." I say "How is that even possible?"

"He's Satan," Death says "He dose what he wants."

"And you?" I ask "I suppose you 'dose' what you want too?" I level my gaze.

"I suppose you do, since you prescribe death?"

The Book is grinning from ear to ear. "I told you! I knew she would spot them all!" He exclaims. "Now for your end of the deal, please fellows?" He tries for a serious face, but his eyes are dancing.

"What...?" I ask looking from red to black and then to The Book "What in hell is going on?"

The Book explains.

"The game was for them to say that stuff without you noticing. 'You're, your, dose.' Three words. If you failed to notice, I was to explain the game and we would have a go to see if we could slip some past them without them noticing."

"OK, so what do we win?" I ask.

"You will not believe this." He says.

"Try me." I say.

"Wear them, now." He says with a wink, as he begins to redden, as if embarrassed, from the cheeks out.

"What?" I say "I can't wear them."

Old red and black have gone. It's as if they vapourised.

"Your good" he says, and before I can grit my teeth "Just practicing."

I look at him from beneath my hood and shake my head.

I suppose the devil really is in the details.
