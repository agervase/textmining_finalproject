The single beam of light filtered through the window, catching the edge of the crystal and dispersing through the small room. An eager hand reached out, but I caught his hand in mine. 

“Wait—you know there’s a price for magic like this” I said, pushing his hand away from the crystal.

“I don’t care. I’ll pay it.” he said, fire burning in his eyes.

“To bring someone back requires great sacrifice. A life for a life; a soul for a soul. Are you willing to do this?”

He looked up at me, tears brimming in his eyes. “I have to do this.”

I nodded and released his hand. He snatched the crystal from the table, clutching the white, jagged edges with fervor. I muttered the incantation, and he collapsed on the floor. My eyes drooped, and the magic hit me like a wave, pressing me back into my chair. Memories filtered through my vision—

*He walked through the street, clutching his daughter’s hand. She looked up at him, grinning. “Do you think momma will like him?”* 

*“I hope so, sweetie.” He said, and his gaze turned to the small puppy rolling amicably in front of them.* 

The dog yapped with delight, but the memory shifted. The vision turned black. The only sound was the gentle yaps of the dog; they turned to deep barks and growls. Smoke swirled in my mind, and color rushed back into the vision. 

*A man stood in the kitchen, clutching a bloody knife. The dog, fully grown, growled and barked menacingly. The daughter, much older now, screamed; her mother lay dead on the floor.* 

The vision faded once more. The growls of the dog turned to pained whimpers, then silence. The memory flashed in my mind, I watched from the eyes of the father. 

*The daughter stood silently, rain pouring around her. The tomb was open, the elderly dog rested inside. Slowly, the girl scooped handfuls of wet dirt, her tears lost in the rain.* 

The vision faded, but not to silence. I heard a gentle barking. Smoke swirled around my eyes, and the memory charged through me.

*He sat with his daughter, both held a cup of warm coffee. Outside the small tavern, dogs barked and ran through the street. He looked at her and could only see the husk of a woman once filled with joy. He sipped his coffee and help his composure, but inside he was screaming. His daughter needed help, and he was failing as a father.* 

*“You can’t do this to yourself, honey,” he said. “I moved on—I had to. I know it hurts. It hurts me every day, but that’s life. We hurt; we move on and become stronger through our troubles.”*

*“How can I?” She said, casting a blank stare towards her coffee, “How can you say that to me?” she said. In another time she would have been filled with rage; but now? Only emptiness.*

With a final gasp, and a wisp of smoke, I snapped back to reality. I lay in my chair. The man in front of me was passed out on the floor, holding the smoking crystal. He slowly rose and looked at me. His expression had changed. There were bags around his eyes, his face had lost its flush color, and he spoke softly. “Did it work? Is my daughter healed?”

“Yes, it worked.” I said quietly. He didn’t know I saw the memories, and I didn’t tell him. 

“That’s good—thank you.” He said, his voice monotone and emotionless. 

He set the crystal back on my desk, into the soft beam of light. I looked up into his eyes—the fire was gone. The fire in his daughter’s heart had died, but he lit it again, at the price of his own.
