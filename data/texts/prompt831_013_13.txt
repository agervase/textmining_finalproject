This was my favorite part of the day. When the sun is still rising, and the bed sheets are half-drawn over my body. I can pretend that I've decided to kick them off, that the warmth of the woman nuzzling her head into my chest is enough to keep me warm. I can smile at the way the sun peeps through our window, illuminating her red hair as strands of it are lazily strewn over my hairless pecs.

But then I have to wake up and experience my least favorite part of the day. That there is no woman. At least, not a woman who cares for me the way I hoped. For those of you just tuning in, let me get you up to speed. The name is Lothkor, guardian of thieves and miscreants. And the woman I dream about? Orisses, guardian of the just. God hit it pretty spot on when he assigned us our responsibilities. I'm madly in love with her. She's a little less romantically inclined.

I know she isn't actually playing hard to get, but a person can dream, right? When I got out of bed that day to do the morning's evil, the first thing that came to my mind was that my hammer needed a cleaning. Guess I couldn't use it today. Oh well, Orisses had said she'd seen bigger anyways last time I used it on her. Opening my closet, I selected a bow and arrow that Cupid had given me millennia ago. I think it was defective, but I like to hold on to hope.

"Hm..."

Throwing the bow on to my back, I waded deeper into the closet and pushed a button to open up a new section of guns and ammo. The glocks would do well. It's important to at least try and blend in to your surroundings.

I never drank coffee, so after jumping into the shower and putting on jeans and a button-down shirt that exposed my broad arms while still counting as preppy, I went straight to my secret underground lair.

"Argon, T.V."

"Yes, sir."

The dual 90 inch screens in front of me awakened. On the left, a map of Metropolis, complete with live feeds of the banks and anywhere else my worshippers would think of robbing. Which brings me to what was on the right screen - detailed profiles of my worshippers. See, I was having beers with Loki one night and found a secret to taking our powers up to the next level: worshippers.

Why should super-villains have secret identities? Peel them away, let people know you exist, convince them of your righteous goals, and apparently our magic powers are amplified tenfold. Don't ask me how it works. All I know is that Orisses would **have** to be impressed by my discovery.

"Hm." My thumb and index finger rubbed the goatee on my chin as I witnessed three of my believers driving a Camaro past First National. Wait, I could see a fourth in the backseat with an Uzi. A new guy? No, wait, it was a woman. I'd never had a woman believer before. I hope Orisses wasn't the jealous type.

"Argo, shoot Orisses an S.O.S. in fifteen minutes." I was halfway out the door by the time my computerized ally answered.

"Sir, don't you at least want to **try** pulling off a successful heist just this once?"

"Loving her would be the most successful heist of all."
