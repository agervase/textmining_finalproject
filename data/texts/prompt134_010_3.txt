I looked incredulously at Jack Black, trying to discern what the hell was happening.  He just chomped on the potato chips, glared back, and smiled.  The look of puzzlement on my face prompted him to finally speak.  I lay chained to the bed in irons.

"You know who I am?"

"Uhh..  yeah.  You're Jack Black.  I've seen nearly all your movies."  
Jack's eyes widened, and a smiled appeared on his face.
"
So you're a fan!"  Which one is your favourite?"

"Jack...  I've seen nearly all your movies.  Including Nacho Libre.  I wouldn't say I was a fan.  That movie..."  I trailed off without words to describe it.

Jacks left his face, and was replaced by a look of anger and hurt.
"Fuck..  I travel 5 trillion miles away from earth, and there's always a critic!  That movie was huge!  It made big money!  Maybe it wasn't the greatest of movies...  but...  Wait a minute...  you've seen nearly all my movies, but you're not a fan.  WTF lady?"

"My roommate smokes a lot of pot, and owns the TV in the house."

"ohh...  right.  My biggest demographic."

"Well did you like ANYTHING I was in?"

"Jack...  we're trapped on a Alien spacecraft, headed for god knows where.  Millions of miles"

Jack interrupted me "Trillions".

My tension increased  "What?"

"No, it's trillions..  Millions would be like nothing...  We'd still be barely away from earth at that distance".

"Whatever!  The point is I'm trapped on a spacecraft, abducted by bug eyed monsters and you're worried about your ego!".

Jack did his best impression of Steve Martin  "Well excuuuuse me!"

"Come on..  you had to like something!"

"Well...  I thought High Fidelity was pretty good.  Also School of Rock.  But what the hell, why am I here?  What's going on?"

"Oh they didn't tell you?"

"Tell me what?"

"About the movie."

"Movie, what movie?"

"The movie we're going to make.  Shit..  sorry, they told me they'd tell you!  That's why we...  err they abducted you...  well..  us for that matter."

I turned my head to my chains, and looked up at him still lazily crunching on potato chips.

"You don't look very abducted".

"Well I'm a star!  You have to expect a little better treatment from people....  Besides, these aliens LOVE all my movies.  All of them!  In fact, that's why we were both abducted.  They want to make a sequel".

"Oh god...  not of Nacho Libre.   I heard you wanted to a sequel of that piece of shit".

"uhh...  no."

"Well what then?".


"You're not going to like it".

"Tell me!"

"You've seen all my movies?"

"Every one, unfortunately".

"Well...  you're REALLY not going to like it".

"Which one!?"

"Year one".

"What!?"

"That was bad...  even for you!"  

"Yeah, I know...  that one I can't defend.  Poor Harold Ramis...  of all the movies to be his last one.  But this alien commander love it for some goddamned crazy reason.  On his planet I think he's sort of the alien equivalent of Kin Jung Il, of North Korea who kidnap people from South Korea, and force them to make movies."
