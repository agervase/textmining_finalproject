DM: Alright, so the last time we played we had just finished that raid to rescue T's NPC waifu, and were camping for the night.  J, roll a quick perception check.

J: 16

DM: Yeah, that'll do it.  You hear people and horses moving around outside of your tent.  What do you do?

J: I grab my scimitar and go to check it out.

DM: It looks like a bunch of your retainer just left camp.  They're about a half-mile out at this point.

J: I shout for the rest of the party to join me and pursue them on horseback.

DM: Everyone else?  You're awake at this point.  What do you do?

O: Uh, I'll go with him.

T: *silence*

DM: You catch up to the deserters and see that T is leading them.

T: *big smile*

J: What the heck?  T, what's going on.

T: I made a secret diplomacy roll to sway your NPCs.  Still think my charisma-fighter build is "stupid" and "pointless"?

J: So you're, what, splitting the party out of spite.

T: Well, mainly I just don't like how the adventure has been going.  It's all just horseback raids and stuff.  I want to besiege some cities.  Maybe do some high-seas stuff.

J: This campaign is literally set in the remotest steppe in the world.

T: Yeah, but there are cities and coasts somewhere, right?

DM: I mean, yeah, but none of it's fleshed out.  My notes literally say "a couple empires to the South and East, sea beyond them; desert and mountains to the Southwest" and that's it.

J: Has your character even seen a city or a ship in his life.

T: No, but I'll figure it out.  Maybe I can capture some NPCs who know about sailing and siegecraft.

J: Oh my God!

T: Hey, I thought we worked out the religion for this campaign.  That should be "Oh my Tengri!"
