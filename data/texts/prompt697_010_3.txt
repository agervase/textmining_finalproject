Jamie gently raised his arm with effort, hospital robe slipping from his shoulders. A cough wheezed from his throat as his sickly lungs could barely exhale. Medical staff in white coats and masks were loading Jamie from a bed into an oval shaped device. Their white gloves wiped down the inside of the pod, cleaning it up from the last guest. Jamie was small, no more than 15 years in age. His short black hair lay just above his hazed red eyes, that he could barely keep open. In that gaze was a dying boy, he stared ahead not seeing a thing. They finished laying him in the device, and a screen latched it closed. The screen illuminated with an upbeat chime and displayed in an 8-bit font

A knight in radiant red plate armor raised his visor, a scrape sounded as it had not been recently oiled. "Figures they would load me here in my last moments" a deep voice filled with honor bellowed aloud. "This was always my favorite Zone, endless plains and eternal sunsets".

NOTES TO CONTINUE WRITING



Had to upend myself while writing, below is just word garbage I'm leaving in case I continue to write by editing the post.

I chose to spend my last moments in a white egg shaped VR pod with a small illuminated screen clasping it together so I didn't feel like a sickly child when I died. I kept waiting for my conciousness to disseappear, they said I only had a few minutes, I just kept playing, appreciating the view in my favorite zone, grassy planes and eternal sunsets. when I was there long enough to see another player complete a quest to gather buffalox tails, I knew it had been more than it was supposed to.  I tried to log off, maybe something happened in the hospital. I did the muscle memory gesture to bring up the log off screen, and nothing happened. I checked some of my other UI features, seemed normal, I checked my stats page and everything was zero, sometimes world events mess with character pages, but they would never disable log off,they always go out of their way to make sure that feature is working. Nobody wants to be trapped. I pulled up my in game Web browser and took a look at the forums to see if there was some kind of server outage, I didn't see anything wrong with the servers, but the top post was "15 year old cancer patient spends last moments in Naviraland". I read on thinking it odd they would post this before I... Time of death.. half hour ago...

It's hard to feel strong negative emotions as your avatar, they dampened pain to have some form of realistic combat, and dampened fear so players didn't lock up when fighting ferocious monsters. The sense of shock permeated any sensation I felt here before. It felt real. I also felt relieved, though my shoulders still tightened and I had trouble balancing. I'm dead I thought to myself forcing the thought through my brain that felt like sldge, but I'm right here.
As time went on I realized certain rules didn't apply to my avatar, the game engine sorts through NPC's and players using heart beats. The NPC's only do what they are programmed, so that makes me something not quite player, not quite AI. I couldn't change my all zero stats, I did next to no damage no matter what weapon or spell I used, though I couldn't be damaged in return, I had no carry limit, but anything I tried to sell, my gold amount was fixed at 0.
The Veil though, edge of the world to keep players in the fixed play areas, I could pass right through.
