*I thought she liked me.* the boy thought to himself as he sulked back towards his room. *I thought she really did.*

The boy wasn't exactly known for being the most astute person.

He continued to ponder to himself, *Where did I go wrong?*

The answer to which would be "Everywhere.", but the boy resolved to himself, a fire roared inside him. He wasn't going to take this lying down... no matter how he both metaphorically **and** literally was.

He brought himself back to his own perverse idea of "How it had all begun."

I will not make such a callous error.

The boy had always admired the girl from afar. Always peeking out from his locker door to catch a glimpse as she walked down the hallway, stealing a prolonged stare during Algebra II (which he promptly failed, to the admonishment of his parents). Oh, how his heart would sing whenever she'd walk past and acknowledge his existence.

It all sounds so cold, so clinical... so downright ***mean*** when described like that. In actuality, the girl had her own life, her own trials and tribulations, her own crushes, her own group of friends she'd associated with. She was no more aloof than any other girl (or any other *student*, for that matter) at their high school. The boy, despite his yearnings, just was never on her radar--until he zoomed in, strapped atop a creepily sensual torpedo.

For some reason, this never quite clicked in the boy's mind.

He was never quite like his peers. He was never all that attracted to Chelsee Morning, the cheerleading captain and apple of *over* half the school's eye; or the buxom semi-tomboy, Jemma Brown (whom even more of those attending would secretly hold in purview). No, he was more interested in "the girl next door"--the ones who were freckled and conventionally imperfect.

*Someone always has to get stuck with the runts of the litter, eh?* or some-such variant were jokes oft bandied around by the boy's best friend, whom he'd serially had to carry into school when the friend was inebriated on cheap liquor. His unending crudeness was usually the main reason the boy kept in his company, but in those circumstances his crass, sense of humor was less endearing and far more embarrassing. Oh, how the boy's cheeks would redden; so much so that his fist would take control of the rest of his body.

Something in his mind that had always clicked was when he was in a dream and when he wasn't. *This is too surreal to actually be happening.* he'd always say to himself once he'd landed in some hellscape or yet another off-brand adventure alongside the comic book characters he'd read so much of.

Eventually, something else clicked in his head: *I can control what I dream of.* No longer did he get caught in some video game-esque zombie dream where he could turn into an odd take of General Anthony "Mad Hatter" Wayne (if the boy's dreams were based on reality, then the Revolutionary War must've been won by far more drop-kicks than the history books told you, and Anthony's nickname came from his predilection toward running headlong into battle to bring the pain to those Redcoats) to protect his thoroughly mediocre Spanish class. Now if he wanted to, he could go off on any adventure he wanted to, with *anyone he wanted to*.

That all said: drop-kicking Anthony Wayne could stay.

Another epiphany came when the boy was sleeping in the back of his friend's mom's boyfriend's ex-girlfriend's aunt's car. The both had dozed off after another exhaustive day of sitting and scribing graphite ad nauseam. The friend didn't find out then, that it *really was* the boy inside his head that day, and not some subconscious-manifest actor. After all, dreams aren't inherently logical, memorable things. Most people only remember parts of dreams if they meditate on them and hold them close.

Once the boy found out he could replicate the experience of joining other dreams on a whim, the revelation hit him: he could use this to join the dreams of the girl he had long admired. But how to get in proximity, as the boy didn't know how close he'd needed to be from the dream's host (NOTE: He'd skipped over the testing for this, upon the revelation.).

The boy would have you believe that he wasn't thinking when he climbed the girl's tree night after night and slept outside her room (He was.).

The boy would have you believe that, at worst, he was only trying to *spy* on the girl's psyche by hitching a ride inside her head (He wasn't.).

The boy would have you believe that he never intended to influence her dreams (He did.).

The boy would have you believe that he'd never thought about the repercussions of warping a young woman's mind into always thinking of him (That's the problem.).

The boy committed murder, damn you all to the most fiery of Hells if you believe otherwise.
