The frog hopped into her lap and croaked. 
The table erupted with laughter and Erin forced a rictus grin on her face.  
With a such casualness as she could muster, she plucked the frog from her lap and turned it around, mildly annoyed, but also friendly. 

Everyone knew she’d kept the pet frog she won at the Renaissance Fair. It wasn’t an embarrassing symbol of her abiding spinsterhood! It was just a pet frog!

"Maybe if you keep kissing it, you'll get your own Prince Charming, eh?" Karen said too loudly and chortled. 

A few people laughed but most people shifted uncomfortably.

"I must say, you wear quite strange clothes in your land!"

"This Chamberlain of yours..." she said suddenly turning on him. "How will he find you?"
He seemed taken aback, stammering slightly before answering.
