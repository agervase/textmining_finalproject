Of course everyone hopes for magic.  The ability to fly, shoot lightning from your fingertips or turn mountains to rubble.  Who wouldn't prefer that to a sword or bow. 

You received exactly what you needed, that's how it's always been.  And however hard you wish for magic,  when that sword you received is piercing the throat of the spell-reflecting shatterfur grizzly that somehow made it into your house, you can better believe you're grateful. 

I'd been sitting up all night awaiting my gift, trying to prepare myself for the disappointment of not getting magical energy coursing through me. 

Looking up at the moon through the window I'd gauge it's just past midnight.  I could get my gift any moment now. And as if I'd summoned him with that thought, there was a knock at the door. Just one soft knock, as if any more would be wasteful as the woman who'd knocked clearly knew I had heard. 

Nerves raced through me as I walked down the creaking old stairs, put my hand on the cold steel handle of the door and opened it. 

Death was an old lady, with kind eyes and a gentle but sad smile.  She reached the scythe out to me and blinking away a single tear dissipated into nothingness. 

Balancing on its handle for a second the scythe tipped over and fell towards me. Out of reflex and instinct I grabbed the falling weapon, still trying to work out what had just happened. 

When the steel hit my fingertips the old ladies voice echoed in my head "I'm sorry". A sharp pain pulsed through my chest.  My body fell to the floor lifeless. My soul standing over it, holding my gift. 

There was  no need for explanation, no need for anything.  I had become death, and death is always needed.
