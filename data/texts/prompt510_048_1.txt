I see her, and time slows to a crawl. She's gliding through a crowd, effortlessly parting it. They're all glancing fearfully at her, through the sides of their eyes as if looking at her head-on would blind them. But I know her. That's my Arabella. I scream, and can't stop screaming. "Arabella! ARABELLA!" And I can't help but lunge through the crowd, elbowing at the people hurrying away. And finally she notices me, turns towards me with a blank stare. 

I've finally reached her, grasping her to me in a hug that cannot possibly convey all the wretchedness I've felt since I lost her, all the relief I feel now that she's back. But she looks at me with those piercing brown eyes, lips parting as if in slow motion to softly whisper "...who? Who are you?"

"Arabella? What's wrong? Why don't you know who I am?" And with that she smiles sadly, saying "Ah... so you're one of those." I can't process this reaction as I'm taking in her face, all the tiny features I know so well. The little freckle on her cheek, the scar above her eye that she told me she got when she ran into a mailbox as a child. It's been almost a year since she left for intensive treatment at a hospital three states away, but she's back. She's back.

But she's holding my face in her hands now, wiping away the tears streaming from my eyes and with a with a melancholy expression I can't understand, kisses me gently on the forehead. "I'm sorry - I'm not her. You're seeing this body right now because she is who you want to see in the end, but that time is not now and that person is not here now." I don't know what she's saying. She's looking at me with the same face I've always known, the same soft hands I've always reached for. But she's cold, so cold. And then I understand - she's gone.
