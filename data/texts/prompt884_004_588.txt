The restraints were surprisingly well done - maybe he was more experienced than I thought. My knife, however, was making short work of them. Although, I wasn't going to cut it all the way just yet. 

I didnâ€™t want to ruin the fun. 

He was rummaging through a drawer, the stench of death filtering up through the floorboards. Was he planning on taking me down to the basement, or doing it up here? Was he a sadist? A voyeur? He didn't seem the quick-kill type. Very few of them were.

His eyes, red and wild, turned to focus on me. Cocaine, or perhaps speed? No matter. It would make things even easier. 

"When I saw you, I just had to have you," he said, approaching me with slow, deliberate steps. "You looked so innocent. So naive. Almost as if you *wanted* to be caught."

He had a drill in his hands. Blood encrusted it, caking the front half of power tool. Was that all part of his shtick, or was he just a messy fucker? 

He started it up, the noise filling up the room. No doubt we were the only ones to hear it - we were far out in the woods. A logger's cabin. 

The perfect place for a bit of murder.

"It was so easy," he continued, nearing me. "All it took was to ask you for directions to get you into my car. Women can be so frustratingly *stupid* sometimes. It just makes me want to *kill* them."

The drill neared my face, then he slowly, deliberately drew it down, past my torso, past my stomach. 

"But before I do, we're going to have some *fu-*"

I leapt up, breaking free from the restraints and getting behind him in one swift motion. I held my knife at his throat, a sliver of blood running down his neck.

"Some fun?" I asked, slowly applying more pressure to the knife just below his Adam's apple, making him unable to talk. "Oh, we most certainly are."

It was hard having a taste for killing. It seemed such a rude thing to impose on someone.

Only killing other serial killers, however - that felt just dandy.
