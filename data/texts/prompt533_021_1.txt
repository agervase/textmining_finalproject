I stare down at my wrinkled out hands. Age is catching up to me, but when my hazy eyes look further down at the training sword that's been by my side for the past 20 years, a smile surfaces on my face. Every day, I spend 5 hours swinging. Once, twice, thrice and so on. a hundred times, a thousand and ten thousand times. 

I can feel my chest tightening, my ears are ringing. I can feel it, my life coming to an end. I don't want this. I am not ready to go. 

I kneel down, my hands are shaking. Like the first time I held a sword between my hands, I can feel its heaviness. No longer a part of myself, no longer an extension of my soul. My head is spinning, and my breathing is ragged. I raise the sword one final time and hear a single thud; A clang which brings a bit of life back to me. I look up, and that life escapes me again. 

"What are you?" I say to the black-robed figure in front of me. I grasp my chest in pain, and my gaze moves down. This man is surrounded by black smoke. Is this death? I don't want to go, not yet.

I struggle to raise up, sword in hand. He's looking at me, I'm looking at him. I can't make out his face, I'm not sure whether it's a man anymore, its face is morphing, from male to female, from a child to a man older than myself.

"Come!" I cry with my last breath. 

My sword is raised, and another clang rings in the room. The room's light is fading. What should have been the middle of the day has turned into a perfect eclipse. I can't make out the training room anymore, It's now just me and this robed demon.

My sword gets readied again, and another clang rings in this endless void. And then, daylight comes back, as if everything was but a fleeting dream. I look down at my hands, they are no longer wrinkled, and with this realization, my back straightens and I feel young. Again.
