A man violently jerks awake from his bed. He sits up and violently gasps for air as his eyes gaze upon a note taped to the wall. In big letters it proclaims "ROBERT". This word looks familiar to the man so he leaves the comfort of his bed to get a better look. He walks toward the note until he can touch it. He grasps forward and removes the note from the wall. It continues to proclaim "ROBERT". He opens the note and there is a short letter written within it. It reads: "Dear Robert, You're probably wondering what is going on. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. See, you, or I, I should say had to do something for the greater good. Magic was ruining our lives. People depended on it too much. Memories meant nothing to them and no one cared to make any meaningful ones. They threw away parts of their lives to light their cigarettes with a snap of a finger. It's so easy. But it shouldn't be. It's ruining our lives and I alone can stop it. See, I discovered a little exploit in the cost factor of magic. The power doesn't come from the actual size of the memory or quantity of the memory. It depends on the size of the memory in relation to remaining memory. So, a newborn infant could potentially cast the most powerful spell by forgetting the day it was born because that would be its only memory. So what I've done, I've conjured a spell to make everyone forget about magic and how to use it. I will forget everything except my name to cast a spell to make them all forget. It will be one of the most powerful spells to have been cast. To cleanse us all of this filthy magic. Then I will read this note that I marked with my name so I'd look at it and celebrate. That would be you now. So congratulations! Celebrate! Yours truly, Robert." The man then drops the note and returns to the comfort of the bed because that is all he knows. The note means nothing to him for he has forgotten how to read.
