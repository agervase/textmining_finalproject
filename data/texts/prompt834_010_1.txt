I awoke in a daze, trying desperately to put the tip I saw into context and remain calm, not trying to overthink what that final tip could have meant before I opened my eyes and was reaquainted with the waking world. ".....always aim for the head?" I muttered to myself, still have asleep and looking around my room for my cat, rukia. 
After realizing she must be elsewhere in the house, I groggily moved from my bed. I already was dreading the fact I had to get ready for a twelve hour shift. Again. As I moved through the eerily silent house, I reflected on that tip once more. 
Slowly I started to reorient myself, while i became increasingly unnerved realizing the ominous silence was definitely unnatural. My mind returned to that tip "always aim for the head". I'm not sure if these loading screen-type dreams are a curse or a blessing, I do know they've never led me astray before. Hell, they've even gotten me laid on occasion so I usually put some stock in them.
Once I reached the door to my foyer, I heard a sound that resembled a wounded animal mixed with a very shrill car horn. I froze in a panic, instantly filled with dread. I quickly grabbed the closest blunt object to me, which just so happened to be my old pellet gun. I knew it wasn't loaded, but it could be used to bludgeon a possible attacker, or whatever may have taken residence in me apartment. 
It was time. With a deep breath I opened the door to the foyer not knowing what could possibly be waiting on the other side. One final time the dream tip screen from before flashed in my mind. What awaited me on the other side was a horrible, visceral image. I quickly moved into action, and trust me, I aimed for the head.
