Death stared at his smug grin, not realizing what had truly happened. 

"Well, looks like I won. Now let's see about getting me back into life and living it to the fullest". Death looked back at him and tried to form the words in his head, he shouldn't have won....it wasn't possible.

"*I'm afraid that is an issue*" Death replied and stared blankly, as would be the case with one who has black voids for eye sockets. The mortal reacted quickly "What's the issue? I WON!!". Death creaked a tad bit, as one would with such ancient bones for a body. "*That's the issue you see*" Death sighed and continued. "*the purpose of this game is not to give you a chance at life, but for you to accept your fate and proceed to the next world*". The mortal responded with confusion "if that is the case, why would you have me play a game which could be beaten?" he continued at a slower pace "I mean chess is able to be reduced to a handful of moves to be countered, it's more common to tie than to win. What happens then?" 

Death paused for a moment and decided to explain. "*The game itself is simple, but your perspective of it should have been clouded. This is done to prevent those who have extraordinary skills from being able to win.*" Death retrieved a scroll from the depths of its cloak "*this scroll clouds your mind, making perception absent from your mind. You cannot feel its absence nor can you know of its existence*".

The mortal picked up the scroll and read it, filled with intricate patterns of circles and triangles, it felt old just being in its presence. Small runes dotted the edges of the scroll and filled the center with an almost imperceptible pattern of perfection. Then he noticed something off, he pointed to a strange discoloration on the scroll "What happened here? when I look at the rest of the scroll, I feel that I see grace and perfection...but here it is gone".

Death picked the scroll up once more and examined the place the mortal had pointed out, he was right, the grace and perfection had ceased to exist on one small part of the scroll. This was not welcomed news to death, for the scroll had existed long before decay and life were ever formed. There are only a few things which could have altered the scroll, no mere mortal or even a god itself may damage it. 



After a moment of deep thought Death reached into its cloak and pulled out an elegant silver rod, in one quick motion it flashed blue flame to melt the rod into a puddle on the ground. Death spoke "*This day has borne issues of ancient forms, I seek council and orders from the brokerage house. A scroll of Iskel has been befouled*". Utter silence fell upon the small area, even the sound of the mortals thoughts have been silenced, hours passed until a response was formed from the silver puddle "***the house has seen this error once before, you must vacate the region at once lest you be consumed***". Death immediately responded with concern "*I cannot vacate while a soul is in my presence*" The puddle hissed "***send the mortal to the next realm, it is not safe for such beings to be exposed***". Death again responded with concern "*I cannot send the mortal to the next realm, the game was won in the mortals favor*" a vile and sharp hiss formed from the puddle "***IMPOSSIBLE. NO MORTAL CAN WIN***" Death was terrifyingly curt in its hasty response "*As I have said, the scroll has been befouled, it did not activate properly*".

This was not a welcome realization to the puddle, after a brief moment of absolute unnatural silence it responded "***actions are being taken to prepare for the coming storm, you must prepare the mortal to travel...we cannot seal the clouded region with a soul still residing inside. Be swift, you must reach the blackened veil by the next year. We shall send the three to greet you as the gate closes.***" a silence formed once more, before being broken with a soft voice "*may the mortals soul be held with mercy, move now!, there is no more time!*".

Death snatched the befouled scroll and placed it inside a copper box. It turned to the mortal and attempted to speak, but it was interrupted "What is the big deal? why not just send me back?" death responded quickly "It is not a simple matter, even if the ability existed to return your soul to the living realm...there is nothing there to receive it" The mortal was stricken with absolute confusion "but time hasn't moved, I can see the clock, it hasn't been more than an hour and ten minutes since we started and yet the clock is still at the same second of my death!" 

Death responded with an almost sanguine gravitas in its voice "*this is why the game was formed, the souls cannot comprehend the state the mortal realm exists in. If I were to drop the facade, you would see naught but ash. When a mortal dies, it is taken into a realm where time is gone, if we were to put you back into the mortal realm, there would be nothing. It is past the point where time and space exist*".

This realization stunned the mortal, but questions it would seem, would have to wait. Death grabbed the mortal and began to run, a dark distant howl had passed their ears. "It is coming, we must make haste to the gates of the Blackened Veil."
