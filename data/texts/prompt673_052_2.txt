My job was nearly done. She was the only one left.

I found her looking over the remains of the world. Not a single living thing was left on the rock once called Earth. The sun was a deep red than lit up her thinning hair like it was on fire. Her eyes brimmed with tears. Her brilliant gown, once long and flowing, was now short and tattered. She sat down and hugged her knees.

Finally, she noticed my presence. She scornfully turned away. "Have you come to mock me?" She asked, trying to hide the tears that choked her.

"Of course not." I responded, and moved to stand behind her.

"No? You haven't come to laugh at my failure?"

"You've failed nothing."

"How can you say that?! Everything I ever made... it's all gone..." She buried her face into her knees. "I thought I could keep it all alive forever. I thought I could keep the sun burning... but I was wrong. It's all over."

I place my cold bony hand on her shoulder, and she jumped. "It doesn't have to be a bad thing."

She looked up at me as tears flowed down her cheeks. "You've done well. You worked hard. You made something beautiful. Something that neither you nor I will ever forget. And now... it's time for us to rest, old friend."

She sniffled. "Friend?"

"Of course." I took her hand in mind. "I've kept everything you've ever sent me. Well... not everything. I always left behind something for you, didn't I? Something for you to make new life with. I loved watching you create. Everything from the mightiest beast to the tiniest insect. I still have all of them. They're waiting for you."

She wiped her tears.

"It's time," I said. She nodded, and I pulled her up onto her feet.

Still holding hands, we both walked to the brilliant light.

"Do you think... I'll ever get to do it again?"

Matter cannot be destroyed. It could only scatter for a time. There would be another big bang, and the cycle would start again.

"Yes. I know you will. And I can't *wait* to see what you make then."
