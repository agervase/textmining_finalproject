I caught the ball and accessed it via palm interface; Mark groaned, stopping in his tracks some ten feet behind and below me, sliding in wet moss. The protection was relatively simple, mere d-grade; my exocortex shuffled through the space of applicable attacks and delivered the 8-character password in under 350 milliseconds. Okay, so Gawain indeed sent it to Mark, and the next one in line would be either Minerva, Janus or Helen with weights 0.4, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. Let's see, Helen could crack a b-grade code easily enough, raizing the backpropagation return by a factor of 9, add x5 from intercept, and given the prior exchanges, my max return would be… uh oh, no time left. I encapsulated the shortlist and predictions, and pitched the ball to Nina within 30 milliseconds of my feet touching the ground. 


Everybody rushed in her direction, but the arc was too high, and she was good enough at this to swiftly jump back, gracefully drawing the ball out of the air with her extended hand. Her expression froze for a moment, celullar brain interacting with inorganic one, codes being disassembled, probabilities compared; then, as she prepared to pitch… 


– ROUND END! - carebot announced. Random timeout, as agreed. – With total scores recalculated, first place goes to William, then Helen, then Minerva.  Congratulations! Also, I'm compelled to inform you that your activities surpass recommended intenstivity for 12 year olds, which may lead to trauma or mental overexertion. Please switch to proper sports, such as rugby, baseball, poker or chess, and refrain…


– Mute, tin can. – Commanded Yorick, still irritated that his risky transaction chain was cut in the first round, almost nullifying the chance of winning. The carebot obeyed. - But man, I wonder if we could play some of that stuff next time. I'm tired of the same guys winning at Byzanball. What say you, Will?


"Will" - that's me. Rather, that's the alias that my peers agreed to keep using for external communications; granted, it was impossible to tell how many conscious entities it represented, because background protocols of refactored agency were creating, modifying, merging and pruning them all the time. Well, perhaps I could develop some logging for that… Right, Yorick.


– No dice, dude. That's just, you know, lame, those *human* games.


– Alas, then there's nothing to do here and I'm going back to my sim. 


Others were also dispersing. Our weekly physical meeting was over. Almost. 


– Okay, but there's one thing we've got left. Hey bot, any news from Earth? Stop damn it! Don't broadcast this junk… wait, why even… Actually, create the task to check if the preferences were changed… ah, hell.


(I sent the task details directly and confirmed its execution. Should hold for a while).


– Unmute! 


– There's 13.2 TB of data from Solar Union, received 3 hours ago. The metadata is impossible to summarize further. Would you like to download? 


– Summarize with loss of fidelity into 10 words or less.


– Mostly upbringing guidance and critique of the colony's current development. Would you like to download? 


I exchanged glances with the rest of my group.


– No, we're good. Purge it from memory. Aand Mute. Boy, was this a surprise. Okay, until next week, then!  



Walking back to my treehouse, I summoned the global workspace. The Council had similarly advised purge of the received data in group repositories; whether it was worthy of inspection at all was still discussed, as per usual – not very actively; most of our brainpower was focused on the carebots having reset their data handling defaults. Apparently there was no cause for concern; but better safe than sorry. 


At the same time, there was merit to looking into the message. There were, without doubt, marvelous advances in space exploration, and thrilling events around the old globe, and new entertainment. Expecially the entertainment! We still haven’t gotten anywhere close to that level, and kids from the younger batches, still not augmented fully, were sometimes nagging about the movies: the "sequels" and all that. 


But all we, the "adults" of the colony, wanted to know were only two things: are the old farts ready to send the follow-up coercion force, and are they able to override our controls and sic the bots on us remotely. 


The second question, and its implications, weighed against opening the message.
