They told us we were sent here. They showed us pictures of people saying it was out... *My* parents. I don't believe them. What's a parent ? All I know are people of my age, and robots. There's a rumor these days that someone managed to get into communication with Earth. I don't believe that either. It is too far away.

There's this thing on Earth they told us about. Things of old, but that somehow never were forgotten. Its called comic books. Its a book, but it isn't just letters like the other books, there are drawings. Its like the drawings are speaking in bubbles. Usually, comic books are about what they call super-heroes. Its normal people, but one day they discover something amazing they have, like people that are bulletproof, and that fly. They called us by names from comic books. I was named Clark Kent. Like Superman, like in the movies. I'm super popular because of that, it gets annoying. But my friend, her name is Cassie Lang. Nobody knows Cassie, nobody thinks Cassie is cool. I don't think so. Cassie can change her size as she wants in the comics. That's better than Superman.

But I, *we* have a problem. It's been 25 years now. And nobody knows what we should do. I like Cassie. And Cassie likes me. And one night, we got undressed and we began to do like in the videos they allowed us to watch when we were 18. It felt good. Cassie was crying at first, but then she enjoyed it. And now we have a problem. They said she was pregnant. They said she's the very firat to be pregnant.  We are going to have a baby. I never asked for  baby. I just want to be with Cassie. But I feel like this is the way it is supposed to be. The robots were not good. Does that mean I am going to be a parent ? What is a parent ? How am I supposed to do that... Parenting ?
