*You deserve this*

Fifteen years I’ve stared at those words scrawled into my forearm. I remember as a kid writing notes all over my arms to remember things. I was forgetful like that. Sometimes I’d write in pen, sometimes in marker. Once I got a hold of a permanent marker, and man was my mother pissed. It didn’t go away for two weeks, despite several baths a day.

I’ve come to recognize my handwriting on my own skin. 

And this was me. I guess I decided to compose in blade and blood instead of ink for this note because I wanted it to stick. I’d need the scars to shout at me to endure a lifetime in these dark cells. 

Because if a man couldn’t trust himself, trust his own voice, what else is there?

I’ve seen inmates go insane protesting their innocence, or breaking their minds to reconcile their punishment with their spotless lives. Surprisingly, the sanest ones tend to be the career criminals who still have memories of the crimes that went uncaught and unpunished. At least they knew they were the scum of the earth.

I like to hold onto the good memories while I wait here. Like Caroline’s laugh. The memories of my wife are a sweet breath of fresh air in an otherwise stinking existence. The voices comfort me a little, but I’ve tuned most noises out.

Caroline hasn’t visited, though. I imagine seeing me in this jail cell is too hard to bear. Maybe if I make parole we’ll be reunited. I know she’d wait for me. She’s loyal like that, compassionate to a fault, even. With my broken childhood, it’s a miracle she fell in love with me at all. I know things were rocky toward the end, before the Blank, but she’s always come back. It will be the same when this is done.

I’d have gone crazy long ago if I hadn’t convinced myself that I was in here for a reason.

The scars tell me that.
