"Hey" James said as he slumped down on the couch beside me, beer in hand. "Hey, it's OK".

Well, it technically wasn't, but I didn't really want to argue with him either, so I just sat there and contemplated how to best kill myself.

"It really wasn't your fault that you got fired..." I felt a familiar bitter taste in my mouth now. His attempts were admirable but I just couldn't bring myself to believe him.

"... or that she decided to break up with you..." I really needed to wash my mouth now - it was my fault, all my fault and I knew it.

"... After all, you're only human." The taste was overpowering. Then, the imaginary turned into reality. I gagged and threw up, all over the floor. 

That's right. I'm not just a human. Not this time. Not anymore. I am a monster, plain and simple. At that thought, I almost emptied my guts out a second time. I might look like a human, but deep down I'm nothing like them. Humanity, a noble bunch, filled with so much courage to keep on trying and never give up. When they fail, it's because they can't, not because they won't. They're only human, after all. Me, on the other hand, I'm not deserving of being called a human. I could have kept that job, I could be chilling with her now, but I'm not. What could have been, I guess I'll never know. But that doesn't stop me from wanting to find out. From ripping up the bandages and digging up the scars. I love wallowing in misery and self-pity. Other people don't seem to like that. And I don't really care. And that's why I'm here, right now. Lost, in my mind, in the what-could-have-been. A monster, stuck in the past. A monster, that can never let go.

"Woah man, you alright?" No, not really. But, in a sense, I guess I actually am.

Thanks for reading! Im a first-timer so criticism would be greatly appreciated!
