"Are you serious?" I asked, looking at my attire. A tuxedo. No gun, no cool weapons, no armour. Just me and a shit ton of gold. I recognized the place from the logo on the wall. It was the famed Wells Fargo Bank. And I was in charge of the bank vault. As a psychology major, this confused me. Wasn't I supposed to be plunged into a lecture, or a gruelling talk on the morality of wars? Psychology was all about talking on things no one understood, so where did banking come into the picture. Above all, which bank security guard didn't have at least a pistol to guard the treasure. I had no time to wonder, however, for the door was burst open and a group of masked men walked into the place. 

"It's just an old guy. In a suit. No arms," the first relayed back, as the others came in to verify and smirked. "Really falling back on payments, eh? Can't even afford decent security," the first said, laughing as they started tossing the gold into their bags while one covered me with his pistol. Somehow, I found the courage to begin talking.

"I am the security," I began, facing the butt of the revolver with determination. "It seems you have made a severe blunder." The group turned collectively to stare at me. Then they chuckled. 

"Hey, did I tell you some house rules? No lying, especially when it's obvious," one said, laughing as he cocked his pistol at me. I shrugged, trying my best to suppress the rising fear within me. "Well, it's hard to say. You must continue. You obviously require the money for *something*," I stated, as I flipped through a novel on the table. They looked at each other once again, this time almost in fear. 

"Listen, I don't know who the hell you are, but you better tell us where the traps are, or...or we'll kill you!" one said, with a undertone of desperation. I enjoyed the feeling of control so much. *Subtly fucking with someone else is so fun.* "Carry on, I really don't think there are any traps. Carry on," I said, smiling, as I gestured towards the gold. They stared at their loot, then at me and my grinning face. Their faces paled, as they tried to find any sign of a trap. There was none. But that was something for me to know, and for them to think about. At last, I knew they wouldn't take the risk. Abandoning what little gold they'd originally taken, they threw it on the ground and ran out, right into the drawn police revolver. I'd just pressed the red button for law enforcement during the conversation, and the rest just went swimmingly. 

"Good job, sir," the policeman said, shaking my hand, as I shrugged, grinning. Who said psychology was a useless major?
