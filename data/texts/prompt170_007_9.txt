Sarlac had the same morning routine every day. She got up, fed her Scottish Fold Mittens, ate breakfast, and then put on her face--a WASPy brunette number she picked up from LizardDirect named "The Julie." 

"The Julie" had been her identity over the last few years on Earth. Like most middle-class Lizard people, Sarlac's parents pressured her into shooting for the Lizard dream: a degree from a prestigious University on Earth followed by a cushy job working for the Zaxnor regime's attempts to infiltrate the United States government. Unfortunately, while "the Julie" certainly looked human, it lacked the Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing skills an actual human would have had over the English language. Three SAT retakes later, and Sarlac had to settle for her safety school. 

After four years in beautiful New Brunswick, Sarlac found herself like a lot of her human classmates: under a mountain of debt and wielding a worthless journalism degree. While not being able to get an undercover job in the media and draw some supplemental income to pay down her student loans was bad enough, the Zaxnor government cancelled its plans to infiltrate major American newspapers (on account of no one believing anything that was written, there was no reason to even deny the existence of Lizard people). Sarlac had lost her actual job, too. 

Too proud to grab the next hyper shuttle back home, she was determined to make it on Earth. At least she was, until a year of working as a part-time barista/essential oils entrepreneur had left her with the realization that she was going nowhere fast. With her only option being crawling home to mom and dad with her tail tucked inside her human-skin pants or serving Unicorn frappuccinos for the next 30 years to try to make ends meet, Sarlac left New Jersey like so many of her human friends had done--cursing Rutgers University.
