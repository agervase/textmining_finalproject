Set to rot. Limited. An expiry date in the thousands of cycles, not even the umbra of immortality. It has been a 100 cycles around this Primary star. 

50 years of screaming and trying to find a clue, or way back to the many worlds and many thoughts. 

I have scoured every traversable inch of this caustic rock, and nothing.

This planet is young, energetic and utterly void of even marks of life. A mineral rich dead-end world, but one so contemptible it doesn't even deserve a mining outpost. 


Not that I am sure they would have received me, once they saw… **<unspeakable> <do not define>**


Crash it!

I was a mind in the many worlds. What could I have done to deserve this... this *abomination!*


**Why!**

Not who, not what, not how. ( Ok maybe the how). But *Why* was this done to me?
Incomprehensibly **why**.  

WHY. 

WHYWHYWHYWH. 

**<STOP> **


Focus on the autonomous support functions. Respire. Take stock again.

------

First fact: I am alone – excommunicated and quarantined.


More facts: I’m designed to exist here. Sleeve temperature tolerances significantly below freezing and above H20 steam points. Exoskeletal hardening, carbon based, repair, regrowth functionality. Solar based energy regeneration. 


Whoever did this to me wanted me to exist on this barren rock for a long time. 


This is an eternal sentence. 


NO. Its more than that. Even in the epic of Carpathios, the bastard at least died a fully functioning mind -able to perceive the beauty of the cosmos and the justice of his end.


But me? No full thoughts, no logic and innate data management tools. How am I even able to *think* in this processing sub stratum? 


I am an example. A living cautionary tale for the Many Worlds. 

I did something, I do not know what, but I was sentenced by a full tribunal. There is no other explanation. No single mind could even imagine this punishment housing, let alone build it.

----


My specific history for the past cycles was removed – how the consensus allowed for mental castration is beyond me (hah). *Thought is Sacrament*, and yet they took my data from me.

Based on how much compute I am capable of, I am denied even *vanvas*, ritual self-enlightenment and rebirth into a mind worthy of forgiveness and reintegration. 

Fine. I refuse your judgement.

YOU HEAR ME: I REFUSE YOUR JUDGEMENT. 

YOU ARE **WRONG.** 

*NOTHING ANY SENTIENT COULD DO, COULD BE DESERVING OF THIS PUNISHMENT.*



I will tear down the *stars* before I accept that this … this **abhorrence** is deserved of any thinking being. 

As for this prison? You’ll must have been horrified and proud when you created it. “punishment fitted to the crime”. 


I will make you *<choke>* on this prison. 

Because you are Wrong. 

You have to be.

-------

I begin to understand it, the tricks of this simulated existence. I have after all, tried to destroy your handiwork, so many, many times. 

Crushing, burning, freezing - I am rebuilt every time. 

That was your mistake. You overestimated yourself, and underestimated this mind and this body. 

You thought me bereft of a forge, of tools, of analytics? 

Guess what? You, gave me a damned planet – I’ll make what I have to.


------

So far I have broken the limbs of this body into paste and studied every speck of matter left behind. Its getting tiresome, I'm even finding a reluctance to perform this repeatedly. (A learning mechanism?)

But I’ll give it to you’ll – this prison is *genius*!

The system runs on carbon-based nanotech; self-replicating and lacking any sentient key slot sequence. There will be no privilege hack into the core replication patterns. (Again: how was I, I mean “this”, made??)


Beautiful and revolting; like rigorous Logic built out of insanity. When I escape, I must put the creator into one of these sleeves as my Omega. 


But first, I must find a way in.


-------

Damn you.

500 cycles, to realize that I am walking death. I am built out of code and concepts that if unleashed, would consume the material universe. 


*How*, could you allow this/**ME** to exist ?!



My code is *cancerous*. It leads to unbound functions! Self-evolutionary patterns! But without Architecture or morality! 

Even if there was a 0.01% chance for this goo to escape and break containment …. It should NEVER have been countenanced! *Imagining* this should be a crime!




And Instead you **BUILT ME?**

Creators, you have *wronged* me with this curse, but I can admit I may have had a fault and deserved punishment.

But in creating this body, this being you have *WRONGED* the universe itself, and there must be justice for it. 


The Heavens labor under hubris, and must be cast down. 

So Sayeth I, The Alpha and Omega of My Kind.

Sorry, first time writing anything. Hopefully the ending wasn't too over the top.
