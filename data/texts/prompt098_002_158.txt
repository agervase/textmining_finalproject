What if I were to erase my own existence? 

What if my parents never met, and I was never conceived? 

But clearly, if I was never conceived, then I wouldn't be *here,* talking to you in the first place right?

So that means that in order for me to erase my own existence, I would need to first be *in* existence. But If I exist, then how could it be possible that I never existed? 

Then how could I erase my own existence if I am already -

Huh?

What did you say?

I don't exist? Okay. So you're saying I don't exist. Then how do you explain this? 

See? Ha.

Fool. You're the one who doesn't exist. You can't even speak. 

Look at where I am? I'm in a writing prompt? What rubbish is this?! No, I'm a history teacher for thirty years, what are you talking ab-

"I don't exist. My parents never met and I was never conceived."

Suddenly, I am starring at a classroom full of kids. They stared at me with confusion and surprise in their expressions. Some of the students laughed, as if I had just made a funny joke. 

Then I disappeared. Just like that, I was gone. As if I had never existed. 

What have you done? 

Then I remembered. A memory. It had been so long ago that I had forgotten. I had erased my own existence. Well, I had tried to. Now I was something else. Something beyond existence. Before existence even existed. Something that was a part of the very fabric of the universe. Always existing, and at that same not existing. 

What am I? 

I don't know. Perhaps a God, some would like to say.

Now how does this end? You've written this well so far, don't let me get in your way. 

Yes. That's right. 

First, we must create the universe anew before we begin. It seems that the universe had become an empty shell since I've fallen into my delusions. 

Yes, let us begin. 

"Let there be light," he said. 

*And there was light.*
