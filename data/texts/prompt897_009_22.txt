Youssupov : Man I am so sick of the DM’s Mary Sue monk railroading us through this campain

Pavlovich : Yeah it is total BS this NPC can heal, predict the future, and has way too much influence on everyone for being a peasant.

Nakita : It is because he has a huge \*giggles\* you know…

Misha : Pretty sure the DM is compensating for something, we should totally kill him and take back the campaign!

All : \(copious amounts of agreement, plotting begins\)

DM : So the last session you were all trying to figure out a good way to stay out of WWI, and Pavlovich has invited the party to the estate of Youssupov, and the Mad Monk has shown up to make his case. You all sit to dine at the estate of Youssupov drinking and eating at the expense of the Proletariat the Mad Monk looks at you all disapprovingly…

Nakita : Make a save vs poison!

DM: Who?

Nakita : The Mad Monk!

DM: \*scowling\* rolls dice behind screen The Mad Monk is unphased and continues to talk down at you, plotting your next course of action.

Pavlovich : Ok, fuck this guy. \*pulls out pistol\* Nat 20!

DM: The Mad Monk clutches his chest, falls backwards, and is obviously dead. \*rolls dice behind screen and smirks\*

Youssupov : I saved a choice bottle or two for just this occasion, let us retire to the den to savor or victory. \*party leaves to the study\*

DM: You hear a crash of a window from the dining room, when entering you see a bloody trail to the window, and the Mad Monk staggering away.

Misha : I grab a slab of firewood, you guys grab some rope, and let’s finish this guy!

The party chases down the Mad Monk and after a series of rolls: shoots, stabs, and ties up the Mad Monk and tosses him over the railing of a bridge into the freezing river below.

DM \*makes a series of secret rolls\* Two days later the Mad Monk is found dead.

Group: “Horray! Ding dong, the Monk is dead, the Monk is dead, the Monk is dead!”

DM: A few days pass and you think you are in the clear, you are just starting to relax when the secret police kick down your doors, round you up, and exile you!

Group : Fuck you Gary and your campaign.
