I'm telling you this as a warning. Immortality is a curse, not a blessing. 

It's not just that you have to watch everyone around you grow old and leave your life. After the first couple dozen generations, you just can't be bothered to keep up anymore. Human connections feel meaningless, and you'll end up living the only life you can: as a recluse, concerned with only your own increasingly incoherent ravings.

But that doesn't last long either - fast forward another millennium, and you're no longer living. No, you're alive, but at the same time, you're not. There's no meaning to your existence anymore, no meaning to life. That's not a life. You simply...endure. Through all the death and destruction in the world around you, watching the world fall to pieces and pick itself up again, knowing that nothing ever changes. It's all just part of a cycle, a cycle that I've been removed from.

They say that the longer you live, the more your perception of time changes. It makes sense: after all, when you're 10, each year that passes is another 10% of your life. When you're 2000? Each year that passes barely accounts for a fraction of your existence. I blink, and another year is gone, the world around me a little worse for wear.

Even now, as the world falls under the brink of nuclear war, I sit in my cave; my home for the past 5 centuries, thinking about the only thing left that matters to me. What does death feel like? Is it my salvation; my release; my freedom? But deep inside, I've come to terms with reality. The reality that one day, this world will be no more, and I will simply float through the universe to my next calling. Waiting. Maybe I'll discover a new world. That should be interesting for a while. Maybe I'll get stuck in a black hole for the rest of eternity. Who knows? I don't care anymore, at the very least.

There's only one thing that's certain as the universe approaches its eventual heat death.

I will endure.
