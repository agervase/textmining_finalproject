It was hard to be a relic in a perfect world. 
Growing up my curiosity got me in trouble and all the social programmers and other kids in the barracks thought i was a problem for stepping outside the lines. 
When i hit puberty at 17, i was put on hormone suppressants and the overseers considered having my pituitary surgically removed to reduce social complications. This was, after all, a full 3 decades early by regimented standards. 
I was constantly required to undergo private tests and told i had the 'aging disease' as well as a uncivilized wildness in my blood that was a danger to the supreme earth order.
I was chemically castrated at 29 and made a eunuch when i suggested a relationship with a fellow trainee. 
I often feel i would have been euthanized before 4th cycle programming, but the eugenicists must have intervened to prevent it for their own scientific curiosities.
Being one of the top watched subjectors on the live broadcasts was rough at first. I once tried to explain to others that it felt like i was in one of those zoos from the history programming. Nobody seemed to understand why being constantly watched and broadcast by my fellow beings would be troublesome. Many expressed the sentiment that it was for their own safety from me and that i should be honoured that so many had taken an interest in my dissability and that i was helping science improve the gnome as well as demonstrate how far the world had come since the purge. 
It was hard finding sponsorship or a master non-the less. Even with the publicity, my dietary needs where extremely costly. Being a full half a meter taller than my superiors was also frustrating. I was constantly reminded of how expensive i was and that my life was permitted by the will of others alone. I often wondered how people from prehistory 150-200 years ago lived. Before the fire. Before the order. The world must surely have been a terrifying place back then.
