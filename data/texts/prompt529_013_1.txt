I slow down, 

"*what?!*"

I check my rear view mirror to make sure that noone is behind me. I contemplate what this could mean, and why a fucking *GPS* is telling me this. *What is even  to my left up ahead? Some woodsy dirt road...* 

**HONK!**
This breaks me out of my day dream as I quickly take a left. I look back to wave sorry, but when I do, all I see is the other drivers face, sadness covering their features. I slam on the breaks. The car doesn't stop. I try to move the wheel, but the tires won't move. 

"Auto pilot activated, *learn the truth* activation code accepted."

I try to open the doors, break the windows, open the trunk, anything to get out. Orange mist starts to seep into the car from the outside. I panic even more, frantically hitting my windshield. I start to feel light headed, blood punding in my ears and my fingers going numb. I sit back in my seat accepting my fate, and look outside. I see dead trees, flames everywhere producing this orange mist, the mist creating clouds which produced red thunder. I hear nothing anymore, everything fades.


I wake with a start, slamming my head onto something, but I can't see. 

"Mrphh..." I try to moan, but I can't. I raise my hands to my face, to find nothing blocking my mouth.

"Mephhphphrhph!" I try to yell for help, but not much noise is made. I then hear someone walking into the room. The walking comes towards me, and I feel a 'pop' as I'm able to see again. In front of me is a stout man with a small nose, and electrical blue eyes.

"Hello, I know you must be very confused, but we have a lot of work to do. You are in a place your kind calls heaven. I am the man known as God. And you are going to be called Jesus from now on..."
