"So are you coming with me or living an afterlife with no will of your own?" He knew I just wanted freedom. Of coarse he knew, he knew all of my thoughts. "So there are mansions? I will not feel hunger or pain? You paint paradise and want me to choose hell?" He turned to me. He was massive. He was also the most beautiful thing I ever laid eyes on. His eyes were warm and pleading. "I am alone wandering the earth, not to take others into damnation but, to finally set them free." He looked at me so intensely I felt like my soul was on display. "Others would be happy there. Not you nor I. You have always been responsible with a wild streak that is never satisfied. You suffer from depression and when you die you just want sweet oblivion. You do not want to praise a diety that has only let you suffer with no explaination. If you come with me you can stay in hell and live how you wish and when you are ready I will extinguish your soul and you will be nothing." How could he know? I found those thoughts sacrilegious and shut them down quick. All these rules I followed and any one can get into heaven? All the things and feelings that I shot down! I wanted my freedom now more than ever. I wanted to feel the weight of religion and an afterlife gone. I walked over to him slowly and grabbed his hand. "You will have my company until I crave oblivion." He then made a tall mahogany door appear. When he opened it a cool breeze met me face along with the scent of rose water. "Not what you expected huh?" he said as he looked at me with amusement on his face. Then we walked into hell together and free.
