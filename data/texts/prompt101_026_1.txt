**The vessel** Part 1

*We live in a world where we are our own worst enemies, the only thing stopping us from achieving our dreams is ourselves. Our doubts, our jealousy, our fears hinder us more than any rules, any government and any physical limitations. Luckily there are people who can take away our obstacles --our emotions .. for a price.  These men, and they were invariably men, are known as vessels.*

David was sitting on a window of his penthouse, one arm draped across a gargoyle staring at the river in the distance. He looked back at the gargoyle. It was silent, just like his corner of his city, with only a few distant pops puncturing the silence. 

The masses who came over to churn the billions of dollars that kept the country had fled the neighborhood as they always did at night, especially on a holiday. 

He tightened his grip on the gargoyle, and looked down at the pavement hundreds of feet below. Today, he would be free. And then stopped. The whispering wind became a violent hurricane, his knuckles gripping the gargoyle head in a death vice became white and all breath left him.  Fear. His feet had turned to lead and would not let him take that one extra step. All he could think of now was his own screaming. He had become a stricken animal void of all control.

David stepped back into his apartment and collapsed into his chair. The air filled his lungs again as he became his normal analytical self. Independence would not be his tonight. Fear had saved his life tonight, as it had done every day, every day, every day for a long time now.

He followed the gaze of the stone gargoyle to the barges enveloped in smoke. On the banks of the river, stood the thousands of people of the city and beyond. They filled with joy and happiness at the fireworks exploding above them. David could almost feel their happiness. Almost, but never quite. David now had a new quest. To give himself the gift of happiness.
