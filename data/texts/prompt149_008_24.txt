Not my prompt, but I'd like to provide a translation of short story by Sergey Lukyanenko called "Do not hurry". As far as I know English translation did not exist, and the story is so on topic, so I decided to translate it.
_______
Clutching a bitten sandwich in one hand and a bottle of milk in the other, the devil looked around. He looked quite ordinary - a crumpled old-fashioned suit, a silk shirt, blunt-nosed shoes, a tie with a shovel. Everything is black, only the scarlet flames on the tie. If it were not for the horns that glimpse through the neat hairstyle, and the tail that hangs from behind, the devil would be like a man.

Tolik thought that in the History of the Middle Ages museum hall, the features on a suit and a tie looked unnecessarily modern. He would have a frock coat.

"What a misfortune ..." spitting out an unfertilized sandwich, uttered the devil. He gently put the bottle with milk on the floor, glanced at Tolik and tried the chalky line of the pentagram with a long yellow fingernail. A spark struck the nail. The devil squeaked and put his finger in his mouth.

"I thought the tail would be longer," Tolik said.

The devil sighed, took out of his pocket an impeccably clean handkerchief, and laid it on the floor. He put a sandwich on it. He jumped lightly and touched the ceiling with the free hand -a high museum ceiling, four meters high.

This time the spark was larger. The devil whimpered and put his second finger in his mouth.

"There's a pentagram in the basement, too," Tolik warned.

"Usually they forget about the floor and ceiling," the devil said bitterly. -You people are inclined to flat thinking ...

Tolik smiled triumphantly. He looked at the crib and said:

"So, with the name of the forces under my control, and with the name of the powers that are beyond my control, as well as with the name of the forces of known and unknown, I conjure you to remain in this place, guarded by the lines of the pentagram, to obey and serve me until I myself, clearly and without coercion, I will not let you go free.

The devil listened attentively, but he could not restrain himself from taunting:

"Could you not memorize? Reading from a piece of paper?

"I would not want to make a mistake in a single letter," Tolik said seriously. "So, shall we begin?"

Sighing, the devil sat down on the floor and said:

-Can I dot the i?

-Of course.

"You did not summon a demon." You called the devil. It's much more serious, young man. Sooner or later the demon would have torn you to pieces. And I'll deceive you -and take your soul. So ... in vain, in vain.

"I did not have a spell to summon a demon."

-Do you want it? The devil put his hand in his pocket. "You let me go, and I'll give you a spell to summon a demon." All the same, only the consequences are less unpleasant.

-And what happens to my soul for calling a demon?

The devil giggled.

-You see ... I will get it.

"Then I reject your offer."

-Okay, let's continue. -The devil looked longingly at the bottle of yogurt. Suddenly he flared: "Why me?" Why me? For one hundred and eight years, no one called devils. Played, calmed down, realized that the evil spirit cannot be deceived. And then those times -the watch comes to an end, decided to refresh myself, and here you are with your pentagram!

"Is the duty long?"

"No ..." The devil grimaced. "Year after two." Only one month remains...

-I sympathize. But I cannot help you.

"So, you bought an unholy force," the devil said dryly and officially. -Congratulations. You must accept or decline the license agreement.

-Read it.

The devil flashed his eyes and minted:

-By accepting the terms of this license agreement, the parties undertake the following obligations. First. The evil spirit, in the future - the devil, undertakes to fulfill any wishes of the client concerning worldly affairs. All desires are fulfilled literally. The desire must be expressed aloud and accepted for execution after pronouncing the words "desire expressed, proceed to execution." If the wording of the desire allows for a double and more interpretation, then the devil can fulfill the desire as he pleases. Second. The person, in the future - the client, undertakes to provide his immortal soul to the perpetual use of the devil, if the fulfillment of desires will lead to the death of the client. This agreement is at your own risk and may be supplemented by mutually agreed terms.

Tolik nodded. The text of the license agreement was familiar to him.

"Additions to the license agreement," he said. - First. The language in which the desire is formulated is Russian.

"The Russian language is unlicensed," the devil grunted.

-What the? Language of the formulation of desires is Russian!

"All right," the devil nodded. - Although by default we have Swahili.

-Second. The client's wishes include influencing people ...

-No, no and NO! "The devil jumped up. - I cannot. Forbidden! This is interference in other people's souls, I cannot!

In general, Anatoly and did not expect that this item will pass. But it was worth checking.

-Okay. The second addition. The client receives immortality, which includes both complete biological health and the cessation of the aging process, as well as full protection from accidents, natural disasters, epidemics, aggressive actions by third parties, and all similar incidents not listed above, directly or indirectly leading to the cessation existence of the client or violation of his health.

"Are you a lawyer?" The devil asked.

-No. Student-historian.

-Got it. Unearthed  the manuscript somewhere in the archive... "The devil nodded. - It happens. And how did you enter the museum? Why this dull medieval atmosphere?

"I'm making money here." As the night watchman. So, the second addition?

The devil nodded understandingly and replied in a quarrelsome reply:

"Why do you all want this immortality?" Well, the second point is adopted with the addition: "Except in cases when the harm to the existence and health of the client is caused by the fulfillment of the client's wishes". Otherwise, you know, I have no interest.

-You, of course, will try very hard to make such harm happen?

The devil grinned.

"The third addition," said Anatoly. - Penalties. If the devil cannot fulfill any desire of the client, then the contract is considered unilaterally terminated by the client. The devil is obliged to continue to fulfill all the wishes of the client, but he does not have any rights to the immortal soul of the client in the future. The contract is also considered terminated if the devil fails to catch the client on an inaccurate wording until the end of time.

The devil shook his head.

"You’ll have to," said Anatoly. - Otherwise, for me, the meaning is lost. You'll sooner or later catch me on an incorrectly formulated desire ...

The devil nodded.

"And I will be doomed to eternal torment." Why do I need such joy? No, I must have a chance to win. Otherwise it’s unsporting.

"You ask for a lot ..." the devil muttered.

"Do you doubt your ability to fulfill my wishes?"

-No doubts. The contract was made by the best specialists.
-Well?
-Well, the third addition is accepted. What else?

-The fourth addition. The devil is obliged not to take any actions that limit the freedom of the client or the process of free expression of his will. The devil should not compromise the client, including disclosing the existence of the contract.

-It is unnecessary. -The devil shrugged his shoulders. -As for the disclosure -we are very strict with this ourselves. I'll be skinned if suddenly ... And about freedom ... Let's say I'll make an earthquake, it'll fill this building with stones, what of it? You will still be alive, according to Supplement 2, and you will wish to pull yourself to the surface, according to the main text of the contract.

"What if my mouth is filled with sand?"

"Worrywart," the devil said contemptuously. -Well, your fourth addition is accepted.

-Fifth. The Devil provides technical support all the time the operation of the contract. The devil must appear at the client's request in a form visible only to the client and explain the consequences of possible actions of the client, without concealing anything and without misleading the client. At the first demand of the client, the devil must disappear and do not bother the client with their presence.

-Severe. The devil shook his head. "You came prepared, yes?" Well, accepted.

"Let’s sign it," Anatoly decided.

The devil rummaged through the inner pocket of his jacket and pulled out several folded sheets. Quickly overlooked them, chose two sheets and sent them to Anatoly to the floor.

"Make additions," said Anatoly.

-What for? The standard form number eight. Do you think that your additions are so original?

Tolik picked up one sheet and unfolded it. A typewritten form was entitled "The Treaty of Man with Evil. Variant eight. "

The additions actually coincided.

"Blood or a ballpoint pen?"

"It would be better to use blood ..." the devil hesitated. -We have such retrogrades ... No, in extreme cases ...

Anatoly silently took a needle from the bottle with alcohol, pricked his finger and, dipping a goose feather in the blood, signed the forms. He returned them over a line along with a clean needle and another pen. The devil, sticking out the tip of his tongue, signed the contract and threw one copy over  the pentagram.

"It's done," Anatoly said thoughtfully, hiding the form in his pocket. "Shall we drink to celebrate the signing?"

-I do not drink. - The devil grinned. "And I advise you not to." Drunken, they always get in trouble. Such desires the say that oh-my ... Can I go?

"Do you need the pentagram erased?"

-Now there is no need. The treaty is signed. Listen, where did you get such a quality chalk? The finger still hurts!

-In the theological seminary.
