The after life is suprisingly dull. 

I'm sat in what appears to be a police interrogation room. I'd have thought St. Peter could have found somewhere comfortable to wait. 

Wait, does this mean I go down?

The door opened slowly a figure I know all too well walked in. It had been a rare thing for me to dress smartly but there I was in my prime in that one suit I liked. 

"Mr. Thurlow, I'm sure we're capable of recognising ourself. So let's begin."

"Wh.. why am I talking to myself?"

"There's no need to be so shocked, you used to talk to me all the time. Anyway the real reason is because before we can go anywhere we have to confront the person we hurt the most. Namely us." 

I sagged down as the air slowly seeped out of me. I, well the other me, continued to sit very erect waiting for some sort of acknowledgement. 

"Let's begin then shall we there's no point wasting eternity." He lightly placed a folder on the table. "I suppose it makes the most sense to start at the beginning. Which would be... yep that would be puberty. No one expected such a happy child to have demons or for that to have caused them I suppose. But still we could have asked for help. Why didn't you tell someone? Why did you let me suffer?"

His voice started to fail me as we suddenly stopped being we and he blamed me. 

"I.. who.. who could we have told? Our own brother didn't protect us, who else would have?" 

"Fair point, but you know the rest of the family would have done something.  Well I suppose you actually saved them, you know mums temper." He said with a slight chuckle. "But all that at the cost of us, why did we have to be the one to suffer?" 

"Because I couldn't destroy that family. They were the only good thing going on for us."

"I suppose you're right on that one. Anyway shall we move on a couple of years? Sorry how rude of us would you like a drink? This could be a long meeting."
