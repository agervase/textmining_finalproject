\[poem\]  
Hi, you can call me silent protaganist #743  
You've probably already seen the likes of me  
The quiet type, oh so stoic  
Listen patiently, don't you know it

&#x200B;

I didn't used to be like this you know  
I used to monologue wherever I'd go  
Talk of bravery and other fancy lies  
Some would love me, some would despise

&#x200B;

And I caught the ire of a powerful mage  
My fanciful words caused him quiet rage  
His scheme was cunning, so hear my ode  
To the shop I found at the side of the road  


\---  


Welcome to Davos's magical emporium  
We've got treats, and then even more of 'em!  
No adventurer is anyone without my gift  
Buy my trinkets and watch yours stats lift!  


Dear sir, yes you! (he pointed at me)  
You look like a fellow who may be in need  
Of a sword (quite affordable) which can cause great harm  
While also (can you believe?)  making you feel calm  


\---  


Like anyone would, I asked for a trial  
The shopkeep said sure, with a wicked smile  
I took the sword, gave it a go  
And into the sword I felt my rage flow  


I struck the shop dummy with the coldest heart  
The sword struck gladly as I plied my art  
While feeling control I've never felt before  
And instantly knew I'd return to this shop door

&#x200B;

On my next trip, I got boots which took away my fear  
Guiding me gladly if danger drew near  
A set of spells wrapped up tight in a book  
Always providing the answer if I gave it a look  


A shield which always seemed to block   
Whether attacked by a rocket or just a stray rock  
A shapeshifting cloak which sparkled with joy  
Chainmail which took my desire to shy away

&#x200B;

I am not ungrateful of my aid, so if anyone asked  
I told them the item I got from Davos's last  
Enthusiastically at first, but you see over time  
It seemed more of a grind to keep stopping crime  


I grew more methodical, and far more cold  
As each new item came and took control  
Stealing part of my personality, making it their own  
And far too late did this deal became known  


I was the greatest, I needed my gear  
I relied on it containing all my anger and fear  
The trade was I could inspire people with speeches no more  
Another silent hero, as Davos cackled inside his door
