I stare in to Life's eyes as he bled out rapidly from the dozens of bullet wounds sprayed from my Tommy. He tries to smile while he prepares to meet his end but has seemingly lost control over even the simplest functions of his body due to spinal injuries. As I draw my Gasser revolver, he suddenly jolts upright and thrusts something into my free hand before I can even flinch. A bit shaken but not surprised, I glance at it solemnly before shoving it into one of the pockets of my tattered trench coat. Life then collapses on the floor in a gory heap, finally at rest. I had known this day would eventually come for an almost infinite stretch of time. A sole tear glides down my jagged cheek for my dear enemy and then descends down into the endless abyss of black that surrounds me from all sides. Knowing what I must do before even my existence fades along with this plane of existence, I begin preparations; I pull out a jar for the resulting sacred mixture of Life and carefully fill it with the substance of humanity. I add in a measured amount of the sweetness of human ingenuity, and take the item that Life had given his life to deliver to me out of the pocket of my partially decayed coat. I crush it in the palm of my hand over the concoction and grimly watch its precious juices, Life's essence, flow into the jar without so much as a splash. Finally, I stir the mixture, and it is at last completed. As I slowly fade away with the rest of existence, I answer the rhetorical question of that omnipotent observer with a sad smirk, "You know what they say," but my words, along with my corporeal form, fade into the cold embrace of the void before I can finish. My final real thought is one of comfort, that tells myself that there must be some kind of resting place for beings like me and Life, and hopes that we meet in this supposed afterlife.
