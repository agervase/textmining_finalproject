The others of my kind mocked me. Pitied me for being afraid of a 'mere mortal'. Called me stupid and foolish for believing he was a god clad in skin and bone.

But they didn't understand. They didnt see what I saw. They didn't watch as he destroyed millenia old empires. Birthed new species and worlds. Banished the darkness in one breath, and consumed the light in the next. His many screens, each a world he conquered or saved, deciding seemingly on a whim. The simple lives he stepped into when he wasn't up for the high stakes of salvation or annihilation. 

I knew. I knew from the start that it was merely games on a screen. Years ago. Even when he started a new game and asked me to play while he watched, his attention for once focused on a single screen rather than five, smiling when I wiped the dust off of the controller he never needed to use...it was never the games themselves that won me over. It was the very real displays of the power he possessed that won my fear. It was his acceptance of my kind when I revealed myself that won my subservience. It was kindness when he offered advice and tips about the games he offered to me that won my trust. And it was his display of vulnerability when he offered me a place in his bed and by his side that won my loyalty.

Perhaps if the others had listened, things wouldn't be the way they are now. But I digress. With a soft smile, I picked up the controller once more, unpausing the game as I tuned out thier screams. One by one my perfect Master got ahold of them and showed them what he was truly capable of. Thankfully there's only one or two left to locate. 

The screams stopped and I looked up, watching as he walked into the room and settled next to me. 

Maybe it's even you next, o reader mine~
