Torgar smacked his lips and grimaced. 

"S'will. 'Ats a mite fine grog fer a baby but no adult wou' touch it!" 

"That's because it is water."

"Wat' er? Wha- wha-...like in mah rain barrel!?"

"The very same."

He looked down into his five pound metal stein, years of corrosion and mold added flavor to what was, a few moments ago, rain water. 

"Wha' am I, a parsnip?"

With a series of faces any mother of a picky eater knows well the dwarf finished the drink and let out a weak, breathy burp.

"Caw, 'tisn't even good the second time around!"

The elf curled her lip and turned away, mouthing a litany of explatives under her breath as she did so.

"Those ruins we 'splored yesterday." 

This caused all eyes to turn to the dwarf. Beyond a recollection of what was eaten or drunk, the vulgar little man had spoke not at all of anything in the abstract. When alone, the elf and gnome speculated that dwarven society might be completely without susinct chonological verbage, though the human was quick to point out the only representatives of Dwarf Kind were exiles, hermits and traders unless one actually met them in their remote mountain homes and dwarves were even less included to take vistitors than the elves. 

"What about them?" asked Sethith as casually as the old wizard was able; it had been his insistence that they explore the defiled fain of a long forgotten god. And while they had cleared the place out they'd found nothing beyond the usual old coins and random sellables. 

"Th' tomb room."

All of them gapped. Here was their besotted ax man passing an actual recollection. Sethith's eyes twinkled as he pulled his notes from yesterday. "Yes, what of it?"

" 'T'was false. 'S dummy room, th' real deal's right under that icky a pool a few doors down."

"It wasn't icky, man, it was a gray ooze laying in wait!" 

The dwarf shrugged as if rancid water and a man-sized carnivorous amoeba were interchangable. 

"We're going back, then?!" Asked the ever eager gnome.

"Aye."
