Suffice it to say, I hadn't really thought this through.

&#x200B;

The deserted miles of open road ahead of me might have counted for something in that regard, if she weren't gaining on me. The fact that I might as well be driving a four-door toaster with hexagonal wheels probably wasn't doing me any favors either.

&#x200B;

Another glance in the rear-view mirror confirmed her slow but steady progress. If not for my tail lights they'd be impossible to pick out against the midnight skyline, but the puffs of red and black smoke were growing steadily closer. I couldn't help but think this pace was intentional; just one piece of an entire performance designed to evoke the terror of prey inevitably being overcome by its stalker. Then there was the way she moved: like quick little teleports, or horrendously timed stop-motion animation, barely perceptible without the puffs of smoke and my own fragile spatial sense. There was no hope of discerning her features under such conditions, but who the hell else would it be chasing me after that little chant into the side-view mirror? All that mattered was that it was *her*, and I had her attention.

&#x200B;

Wind rushes past the open window, hopefully carrying my cackles to her ear, as I push my jalopy ever closer to its limit. *And you said a master's in theater wouldn't get me anything, mother. It might just* get *me killed.*

&#x200B;

The laughter was fake, but that's much easier to pull off when the smile is real. There was a part of me that *did* want to see her again after all.

&#x200B;

A scene flashes through my mind, but not like it usually does. This is just a memory. Huddling in the corner of a room illuminated only by moonlight. A menacing figure looming in the doorway. A child's tiny hands, my hands, reaching desperately for a mirror across the room... and then the blood.

&#x200B;

My fingers tighten on the steering wheel. I haven't changed anything yet. At this rate she'll catch up to me before I do. Time to put two semesters of improv to use.

&#x200B;

I reach over and flick the switch on the automatic window, my second finger finding its way to the lock button almost instinctively. Just as the window comes to a close, I slaw on the breaks and crank the wheel as hard as I can. The result is not, admittedly, as smooth as I pictured in my head, but I come to an awkward and jerky stop in the gravel on the opposite side of the highway. My high beams cut a path through the darkness in the direction I'd just come from.

&#x200B;

And I see nothing but the dissipating smoke clouds. Red and black plumes fading away into the night. Of course. Odds are good she'll just be *right there* outside the window, staring at me, unblinking, if I turn my head. That's how these things work, right? *Maybe I can stall indefinitely if I just keep staring dead ahead and hyperventilating.*

&#x200B;

A few moments pass in silence. So far so good. There isn't a trace of my pursuer in sight. I can practically feel the milliseconds ticking by, but that's probably just my heart rate.

&#x200B;

And then a waft of red smoke drifts past my face.

&#x200B;

"Done playing chase, are we?" A voice comes from the passenger seat. Each word delivered deliberately, with the frigid precision of falling icicles.

&#x200B;

For the briefest instant my body goes just as cold. Air ceases to enter my lungs. My heart stops beating. My blood no longer flows. Even my hands stopped shaking. But becoming an ice sculpture isn't going to get me out of this. Freezing up doesn't work on stage and sure as hell won't work here. It'll just get us both killed.

&#x200B;

So I do the only thing I can do. I turn to face her.

&#x200B;

I'm met with a more eerie sight than I could possibly have imagined. Not a terrifying visage coursing with malice. Not empty eye-sockets that stare into my very soul. Not a psychotic grin stretching from ear to ear with the anticipation of smearing my guts across the pavement. I'm met with nothing but familiarity.

&#x200B;

Long, impossibly crimson locks that cascade gently around a pale face and down over slender shoulders draped in a black shawl. An ivory dress that cradles her figure from her neckline down past her knees culminating in the hem; an intricate lace pattern dancing all the way around her above two pale bare feet. And then, of course, the blood. It glistens as if fresh, and takes on a red so vibrant as to almost certainly not be human. It soaks into splotches all across the otherwise immaculate dress, but barely a splash of it is spread across her face. It does nothing to hide the overpowering beauty underneath. *God. Damn.*

&#x200B;

20 years is a long time, but it all comes back to me in a wave certainty. There's no mistake that it's her. The exact same outfit as before. The same radiant hair. The same vermilion blood. The same pair of shimmering rubies that I make eye-contact with.

&#x200B;

She raises an eyebrow slightly. Clearly I did not give her the expected reaction. Suddenly I'm self-conscious. Forgetting to be terrified for a moment I resort to my usual defense in an awkward situation.

&#x200B;

"Well if you want to give me another head start, I'm happy to go best two out of three..." *Okay, yep, I'm gonna die now. She's gonna murder the shit out of me and I totally deserve it.* There is a prolonged silence during which my eyeballs are probably bulging out of my skull.

&#x200B;

"I think you misunderstand the gravity of your situation," she finally says, flatly.

&#x200B;

"I can see how you'd get that impression," I agree quietly, my trembling hands still clinging to the steering wheel. I can feel more so than see her eyes slowly study me. I detect a hint of... curiosity, perhaps, in her otherwise expressionless face.

&#x200B;

"I'm not one that it's wise to play games with," she said pointedly, raising a hand in front of her face. A crystalline claw forms at the at her knuckle, extending several inches past her fingertip, the same brilliant color as the blood she wears. I know what she can do with that.

&#x200B;

"Of course not," I say quickly, "and I do apologize, if that counts for anything, for any inconvenience or insult I may have caused..."

&#x200B;

"Sincere apologies are not usually preceded by taunts and cackles," she cuts me off.

&#x200B;

*A very good point. I might have gone for a bit too hard of a sell on this one.*

&#x200B;

She continues before I have a chance to speak. "But that presumes sincere jeering as well. Whatever game you're up to might actually be new to me. " *Thank god I'm not as good of an actor as I thought. She must have noticed me drop character before the window closed.*

&#x200B;

"For the record," she continues, a second claw forming on her middle finger to match the first, "you're not original. The driver's-side mirror has been done," she pauses and allows herself a brief but wicked grin, "to *death*."

&#x200B;

S*hit.*
