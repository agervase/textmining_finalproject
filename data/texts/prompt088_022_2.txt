There he was, finally, just across the stadium from where I was sitting. It took about six years to track him down, but I persisted. The bounty on this guy was huge; enough to free me from the obligations that led me here.
I never really liked this job much, but it was the only way I could pay my debts. Usually they only passed me down marks after their reincarnation was past the Point of Memory. After about 19 or 20 years, you got back what you did in your last life. I always thought that was the redeeming factor of this job. At least they knew what was coming to them, right?

This time, though, they told me to make sure I got him before he could get anything back. We call these ones the Forgetfuls, and they don't happen very often. If you pass before the Point of Memory, all of your lives before are gone for good. Most of the time, a Forgetful is born from an accident. I've never had to make one before. Still, here I was.

To find this guy, I had to find a Seeker, one of the few people able to pull on the spiritual strings and find the reincarnations. The first few I went to weren't able to find him, they said his string was too thin to trace. Apparently that happens when you live enough lives. One of them suggested that I find her teacher, a blind man in Georgia. Before he told me where the guy was, though, he made me promise not to hurt this child.

Too bad, man. I don't want to break that promise, especially not now. I watched my target another minute. In his last life, he lived to the ripe age of 73 and amassed the largest known crime empire in the States. When the FBI were closing in, he offed himself to avoid the punishment. All of that brought me here. I found a good angle to go from and made my way up to the roof. My cross-hairs found their mark as I reminded myself how horrible this guy was before.

Bang. The little girl fell as her father was coming back with a classic Dodger Dog. It wasn't her fault, it wasn't his, but it had to be done.
