“What do you think they see?” I ask.

“What do you mean? They never look at us.” She’s eating a bag of caramel corn from the candy store, and I have some curly fries from Arby’s. Don’t judge me. That’s the best the mall food court had to offer.

“I mean, when we touch them. They always look at me, for just a second, before they run.”

“I don’t know. I don’t know if I want to know.”

*I don’t know much about what happened. From what I can piece together from my belongings, I used to be a research assistant up at the University, but then the accident happened, and I can’t remember anything specific.*

*I woke up in a hospital bed with a jagged scar across the length of my left forearm, and no one in the room.*

*I walked through the hospital in my gown. No nurse, no doctor, no visitor or patient stopped me. I reached out to one of them, and grabbed her arm. She looked in my eyes, the same look I would see a thousand times from that point on, and turned and ran.*

*I tapped a doctor on the shoulder. A middle aged lady waiting on her son’s checkup. A receptionist watching the Office discreetly on his phone. They all turned, and went the other way.*

*I walked home, thinking things would be different. But when I knocked on the door ten times and no one answered, I let myself in through the back gate. I heard them laughing in the backyard. Maybe there was a party for my return, I’d thought. Maybe it was all some massive practical joke, and I would be Punk’d or something.*

*But when I saw the look in my mom’s eyes, that look of fear, of…disgust, I realized something was terribly wrong.*

“What happens if you call them?” I ask. “Have you ever tried that?”

“No one picks up. I don’t even know if they get the calls.”

“What about voicemail?” I asked.

She rolls her eyes. “You really think They wouldn’t have thought of that?”

That’s what we’ve concluded at this point. It has to be someone, whether a God or a Demon or some uber-powerful scientist running some twisted experiment who did this to us. Actually, scratch that. It can’t be a God. No just God would ever inflict this on someone.

It hurt so much, at first. I’ve always been kind of invisible my whole life, from getting picked last on the soccer field in kindergarten to being left out of the yearbook completely my senior year. But I always had people who loved me. My friends. My mom and dad. My older brother, as much shit as he gave me. They would talk to me and listen to me and answer me and tell me that things would be okay, and I believed them.

But then I was nobody to them, and it felt like they had abandoned me. Left me behind on purpose, disgusted by me. Of course, I ran through the situation logically so many times. This wasn’t my fault. I had never tried to hurt or wrong anybody. I didn’t deserve this, and I believed that most of the time. But no matter what, the loneliness ate at me, confronted me every night with the stark unavoidability of itself. Sometimes, you know the answer to your pain, your loneliness, but you just need to hear it from someone else. I couldn’t, and the silence only became more deafening. It was like I was in solitary confinement, and the world was my cell.

*Eventually, I came to appreciate one part of it. The freedom. No one bothered me, no one cared about what I did. For whatever reason, they couldn’t.*

*I could walk into a 7-11 and get myself an Arizona Mucho Mango whenever I wanted. I could go to any store in the mall, and pick out any brand name shirt or jacket I wanted, and take it out just to throw it in the trash or leave it on the ground. I could go to the movies whenever I wanted, and sit in any row, any time, any day.*

*But it still hurt. Then, one day, I was in the theater. I’d just gotten out of the latest Avengers, and was thinking about sticking around for another showing.*

*She was standing there, in the aisle, looking straight at me. Sometimes that happened, but they were never looking at me, as much as I wanted it. I figured there was someone behind me, so I ignored her and kept looking at what was showing, walking around the theater.*

*“You’re invisible too?” she asks, suddenly standing right next to me. “I watched you take those nachos.”*

*I looked at the empty bag in my hands. I was so shocked, I didn’t know what to say. “I’m sorry. Were there any left?”*

*She smiles “Nope. But that’s okay. I’m sure we can get some more.”*

*From that point on, things were different. Of course, I fell in love with her, and as far as I know, she with me. I do think it was a product of loneliness, like how even forty degree weather can feel like a sauna if you’ve been out in a below-zero snowstorm, but I didn’t question it.*

*But other times, I did think maybe it was a God who had made it happen, who put us together so we could go to Disneyland and turn all the rides on at night or get on an airplane and fly to whatever city we wanted, sitting first class. A God who made it so that the best part of doing whatever was that we were together.*

We reach the theater, and she stops me before we walk in. The new Star Wars is out, and we wanted to get the best seats in the house. She senses that I am a little anxious to get in, so we don't have to kick anyone out of their seats.

“Don’t worry about them,” she said. “Why does it matter?”

“Because…I don’t understand. Why did it happen to us?”

“I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll ever know at this point. But…I do know that they don’t matter. My whole life, I didn’t exist to them. You didn't exist to them. Now…it’s like they don’t exist to us. They’re invisible to us. Isn’t that great?”

I can’t help but smile. “It is.” I wonder if she knows that even if they could see us, if all this hadn’t happened, I would feel the same way, as long as I had met her.
