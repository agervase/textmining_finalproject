Unit 2782320 EnvironUnit 912 Actual on report on the 3rd satellite, they call Earth, from the star known any them as Sol.  

The inhabitants of the Earth still remain biological units.  Having not yet transferred their mords to firmware they are bound to a single lifespark. 

--cut through slow scene of human larva they call babies to death and the ancient practice known as burial--


Unawares of this or perhaps uncaring they bravely engage in tribal warfare with each other attempting to end the life spark of each other for no gains. 

--move to scenes of tribal warfare using projectile weaponry--

The primitively tribalistic culture also permits predators that can snatch their lifesparks in mere moments to walk among them. Even more daring some actually enjoy seeing these predators even closer.  They actually seem to enjoy putting their own lifespark in peril. 

--cutting to bears and sharks and people swimming in oceans near sharks--


This ancient culture still engages in the ancient practice of sex. They seem to worship the act of sex as a huge amount of their global information networks are jammed with images and videos of sex being enabled by others. 

--show clips from the global information network--

While few calls have been made to incorporate this culture into the galactic network the amount of music and artwork that pours from this culture is astounding.  They are tirelessly in production of millions of forms of entertainment. 

--cut to scenes of music types, languages, and art from them--

Not having a single language to communicate the individual lifesparks must audibly communicate in the ancient style. With over seven billion sentient units speaking audibly with over 59 languages being spoken. Many with alternate dialects. You could imagine their world being noisy and it is!

Still dwelling in thier world was the most excitement this unit has had in a millinea. They almost invite you to risk it all for a pointless endeavor.  They live fast and often die incredibly fantastically.  They are almost a parody of the lifespark itself as if they had an alternate lifespark awaiting them elsewhere. 

Unit 2782320 EnvironUnit 912 Actual on report on the 3rd satellite, of the star known as Sol. Signing off.
