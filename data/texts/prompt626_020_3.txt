Everyone has a kinesis, a power determined by their place of birth. For example, most people have Earth-based powers, but people born in the mountains have more control over the air and weather. Desert people can summon sandstorms. Coastal and island people have hydrokinesis. Other common powers include ice and fire. 
Thanks to the power of everyday people, Earth is agriculturally stable and energy is not a problem. In school, they teach us to hone our powers. It's supposed to be a nice place where people get along. Unfortunately, due to human nature, this is not the case.
Some of us don't have the normal powers that others have. Take my buddy Max for example. He was born at a rock concert, so his power is the ability to cause shockwaves. Since our powers don't conform to normal expectations, we are known as Exceptions. 
I am the ultimate Exception. I am the only person to be born in space. This gives me lots of variety in my powers. For example, I can turn my body into stardust and phase through things, and I can summon any cosmic object and control it to an extent. Despite my power, I am ostracized from many social circles. I actually prefer it that way, because I know people would just use me anyway.
My powers cause lots of friction at school. The most annoying cases of this are found in Roy Al Payne, a mountain boy, and Stu Pidity, a volcano kid. They tease the Exceptions nonstop, and I have to deal with them every day, despite the fact that I could easily obliterate them. 
One day, Roy and Stu challenged me to a fight. We met after school on the field. Surprisingly enough, the whole school was watching. They both attacked at once, and I might have enjoyed messing with gravity to make them hit themselves and using wormholes to teleport circles around them.
Unfortunately, I had homework, so I just wiped them out with a meteor and flew home on a comet.
