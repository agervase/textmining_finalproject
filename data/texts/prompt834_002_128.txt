The alarm went off that Friday at 6AM just like it did every day... except waking up that morning did not feel even close to as calm as waking up any other morning. The words "Always aim for the head" kept playing back in my head over and over again like a terrible song that just wouldn't leave no matter how badly you tried to get rid of it. I knew I was in trouble,,, or at least knew I had to get myself OUT of trouble or else something terrible would happen. I remember walking around my house (which I live alone) nonstop looking for a weapon to protect myself due to my paranoia. When I couldn't find a weapon I locked myself in my room and waited until I had to leave to pick up my nephew from school. His parents are at work at the same time on Fridays, so I pick him up and watch over him until his parents get back from work. That day he wanted to go to the community fair and I figured why not go to take my mind off of my paranoid thoughts. At the fair, I purchased two day passes to ride any ride or play any game with my nephew. As the fair was wrapping up, my nephew looked over to the one place we haven't stopped by yet. It was one of those water squirting games where you shoot the water into the mouth of the clown. We both arrived and sat down to play. Just a minute before the game started, my nephew looks me dead in the eyes and says "Always aim for the head!" At that moment, I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time. So many emotions ran through my head. I hugged my nephew tightly and said "you bet I will!" After we played the game and gathered our prizes I dropped him off back home with his parents and told them how much fun we had.
