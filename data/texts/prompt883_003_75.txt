It isn't too surprising that James came to regret his decision.  He knew it was a risk, but in a world full of min-maxers, he figured the only chance to potentially get ahead was to think outside the box.  Now he was thin, essentially skeletal, feeble of mind, devoid of charms, clumsy, really without any apparent redeeming qualities... but at least he was lucky, right?

He shakes his head, looking up to see the passenger plane falling from the sky above him leaving a long trail of smoke and flames in its wake.  The first time he saw something like this he was awestruck and terrified.  Now he just continued walking, the explosion a deafening roar behind him, a massive chunk of debris landing where he stood just moments before. 

Too bad nobody warned him, but it wasn't really their fault. Luck is a funny thing, which nobody truly understands.  One can't increase their own luck without taking it from others, and in a world where everyone was obsessed with making themselves smarter, stronger and more beautiful, luck was the one statistic everyone just happened to ignore.  A shame, really, because it's very helpful.  It can make the difference between a beautiful woman becoming a supermodel and living in obscurity, or a high school foot-ball player becoming a national league champion, but the reverse also applies.  Luck without any sort of talent to go with it was meaningless.  One can't succeed unless you try, and almost any effort requires some level of exertion which he was now incapable of.

He swallows nervously, the wheel of a truck driving through an intersection just happening to fly off through a store-window, sending the vehicle rolling into traffic.  He had inadvertently stolen all of the luck in the world for himself, and spend his days terrified that eventually everyone would realize that the hellish state of things was entirely his fault, but they never ever did.

How fortunate for him.
