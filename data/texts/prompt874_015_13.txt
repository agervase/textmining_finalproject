I had just finished checking Marlock The Wise's vital signs: gradually declining, but seemingly stable for now. His palliative medication was dosing as prescribed, and his sheets were clean, and bedpan empty. He didn't have much longer, but at least he was comfortable. 
Dr. Stephens entered, followed by three members of the Order of Warlocks, and I briefed him, and I was thanked for my diligent work by the junior member of the order, dressed in his crisp red ceremonial robes. 
Checking my watch, it was my "lunch" break, though it was midnight, so there wasn't much open if I wanted to grab something. I figured I'd stick around anyway, in case they needed anything. This was a VIP after all. 
I ducked into the break lounge across from the nursing station, and grabbed a few slices of bread, and popped them into the toaster. It had been a long shift - it always is. I try to give my 100% to all of my patients, but something about Marlock compelled me to give just a little more. 
I had just poured my tea and buttered my toast, and was carrying my plate over to the small table in the corner, debating between yesterday's thoroughly disheveled newspaper, and a Reader's Digest from 2013 when it happened. 
The lights in the palliative care ward dimmed briefly, and cool breeze whooshed through the hallway, and a shout in an ancient language echoed deeply down the hall. Startled, I froze in my tracks, and my snack slid right off my plate as the Dr. Stephens stuck his head in the doorway "Marlock had passed. I need your help with the post mortem."
"I'll be right there" I replied, as I bent down to clean up my mess. I paused, awestruck, as I knew the curse was finally lifted. My toast lay there on the linoleum floor...
...buttered side up.
