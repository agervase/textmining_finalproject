I watched for a long time as the blood dripped down the trailer walls. Eventually it dried to an almost black. My face itched where it had crusted on my skin and I could taste rust on my tongue. When the sun had set so low that I could no longer distinguish between the stripes on his socks, I finally stood, stumbling when pins and needles came alight in my legs. Taking one last glance at the body, I left the wrecked trailer hidden by fallen trees that we had adapted as our hideout for so many years. 

Balancing the likelihood of hallucination against time travel, I kicked his bike into the lake. It slowly sank, concealing itself among the water lilies and discarded rubbish. Then I walked away.

Two hours later, a worried call from his grandmother woke me. I promised to try getting in touch with him. When she hung up, I took apart his phone and flushed the parts down the toilet. In the morning the police began their search. That evening they gave up, declaring him a runaway.

After seven months, the sharp pain of losing my only friend began to fade. One cloudy Saturday, I knocked on his familyâ€™s door. His sister opened it, her face lighting up with surprise and then darkening with resentment. She  turned and I followed her into the dim hallway. His bedroom was untouched, a shrine to his last day alive. A cup sat on his windowsill, the dregs at the bottom thick with mould. The last book he ever read lay, open at chapter 13, on his pillow. Disturbing clouds of dust, I began my search. 

It took me a few hours to sift through the mess, but slowly secrets were revealed; a stack of porn hidden at the back of his wardrobe, the shirt I thought I had lost, a bag of weed, a black balaclava, a ground floor map to the local primary school and a rifle loaded with bullets.

And I knew that I had to stop him.
