For the longest time I've felt that I am not completely there. Some days were better than others, where I can go through the day like I'm on autopilot, everything just clicks. I can laugh without thinking about what causes me to laugh, I can think without thinking about where that voice inside my head comes from, and I can look into a mirror and see myself and say, "this is me". 

All the other days, however, are a struggle. I'm not sure when it exactly started, maybe after my first time smoking pot with my friends and something in my mind changed. Though I don't really think thats how it works, it might just be an excuse. My only other thought would be my parents divorce triggering something in my brain, making me realize nothing in this life is permanent, not even a husband and wife's love for each other. 

People call what I'm feeling, depersonalization. Or perhaps it's an existential crisis. I'm not an expert in how the mind works, and I have no drive to see a therapist to get a professional opinion. It starts by getting the feeling that my mind sinks thousands of feet into a pool of water. I begin to think, "is this really happening? Am I really seeing this right now? Am I actually thinking right now?". Almost like I'm waiting for the simulation to be over. 

Today I had my worst depersonalization episode in recent memory. I was going through my usual morning routine in the bathroom, when I got that feeling again. This time, I looked deep into my own reflection, into my green eyes, which I'm told is my best feature. 

I stared into my eyes for what felt like a lifetime, when I finally saw what was behind them.

It was me.

I'm a tiny bug. A parasite?

I saw myself, a little green fellow with a bunch of legs and beady eyes. I was sitting at a control panel, surrounded by screens and keyboards and flashing lights. I saw one button that read in big letters: AUTOPILOT

"Huh, that must explain those good days"

I reached into my little parasite pocket, and found my little parasite wallet. I opened and saw a license with my address and some pictures with what looked to be a family. My family?

I got out of my chair and walked towards what looked like an exit and hopped out of my former ear. I wanted to go home, and for some reason I knew exactly where I was going. I found a little dirt hut near a river my former self used to love swimming in. I walked through the little pebble door and saw a woman parasite greeting me.

"Welcome back honey, how was your business trip? I'm so glad to see those beautiful eyes again!"
