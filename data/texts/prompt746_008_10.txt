Something was amiss. As I slithered out from under the bed I noticed a particular noise, crying. I wince at the noise as us monsters don't like the sound of crying children; it attracts too much attention. I listen closer and discover the crying is not that of a child though, and is coming from outside the room. I relax slightly and turn towards the bed. It's empty. My liver sinks heavily into my chest. Janie wasn't there. 

I quickly ducked under the bed back into the shadow tunnel that would take me to HQ. Pressing a few buttons on the Coordinating Computer I have it retargetted to the kitchen. I slither out into the inky black behind the fridge and listen. 

"We've done all we can Sarah. I'm afraid it's in the police's hands now."

"I know Frank, just, I feel so helpless. Who would kidnap Janie?"

And now I knew why they were crying.

I rushed to my supervisor.

"Janie is missing."

"Who?"

"My chil- The child is missing."

"So? Happens all the time. Just scare her again tomorrow."

"No, I mean she's gone. Her parents said she was kidnapped."

My supervisor looked at me and pressed his 13 eyes tightly shut for a second. "Fine. Delete those coordinates. I'll find you a new child for your roster."

"I didn't mean that, I mean we could find her!"

"Find her?!?! Ridiculous! If it wasn't very dangerous already, we have a power shortage at the moment. We need all the scare power we can get, and we can't have you wasting time trying to find children. There's always another one after all."

I nod solemnly, he's right after all. That won't stop me from trying though. With all of this technology here I can jump to any shadow in the world without a sound. I WILL find Janie.
