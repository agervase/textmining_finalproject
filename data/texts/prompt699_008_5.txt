I opened my eyes and saw the christmas light's reflection on the mirror by the bed. The room was cold, I had slept in a shirt and started to shiver. I got up, checked the radiator and it was ice cold. I put on some clothes and headed to the bathroom. After slowly managing to sit on the ice throne, I took a leak, washed my hands and headed for the heater. It displayed a warning code. 005. After a 2 minute google search I managed to find out what it stood for. No gas. Shit. They cut our gas.

I had been attending university for 6 years now and it was no longer a joke. My parents had stopped paying my rent or even the scary big gas bill. It was fucking January. And gas prices were off the roof. As always.

I earned a living working as an English tutor for a couple years. The first week of December 2088 went okay, but money was spent on new years. I was getting paid cash after every class, so I had no idea how much I would earn in a month until the month was over. 

Unknowingly, I spent money, thinking class would continue or even increase during holidays, as I was used to from former students. 

Oh boy, I was wrong. No class till mid february. No money till mid february.

So I had spent new years with friends, not my family. So they realized that they have become the victim of their own choice to lie to me all my life. I had distanced myself from them and did not need them anymore. Except, I needed cash. Oh so independent.

But then, a miracle happened. My credit card arrived. First one I ever owned. I am 24 years old and online shopping was very limited for me.

I not only got the gas back on, I bought a new heater for more pleasant showers without temperature flactuations.

I got a job earning 7k a month, working 15h a week as an english tutor. 

I was able to get myself a new computer and phone after 5 years. Do you know how fast technology evolves nowadays? My old phone had a 3d screen , the new one can teleport me, even to the mars colony.

One night, while trying to sleep, I suddenly had a complete picture for an outline for my senior thesis in my head. I spent all night and wrote part of the intro and found research material. 

And the other day, all the problems me and my boyfriend had resolved.

Then that phone call. My mom.
-How are you kuwairo?

-Actually I couldn't ask for more. All is well.

-I am glad you are happy. Happy New year. This is from all of us to you. 

-What is, mom? I didn't get it.

-Your gift from all of us. And from the council.

-What are you talking about? I can't seem to follow.

-Oh, your new and easy life. Your happiness. Our gift to you. We put our trust in you.

-Have you had me get the job?

-No, you did that by yourself. But you were, let's say, handicapped before.

-How so?

-Oh I was hoping we would have this conversation one day. I always believed in you.

-Mom! Get to the point, please. No time for riddles. I am a busy person now. 

-The government conducts an experiment on all newborn babies. Those with high iq's live life by the hardest stage. The ones with a low iq, live life in Easy mode. It is to establish full equality. That is how there is no rich or poor. Or rather, barely any poor. You were quite an exception.

Have you ever asked yourself if your life is harder than those of others? Have you felt odd, unique, or special, because of that? Feeling aware of all?

Well. There is so much you don't know. You were the smartest kid born your decade. So they asked our permission to make your level harder. Harder than any life before. 

-How is that possible and why do something like that? How could you do that?

-Research. And every member of the union is obliged to offer their self to science. We thought you could cope with it, the harder life. You would be so strong. You would have an amazing character and also be qualified to become president. 

- What the hell? What kind of parenting is this?

-You will be living life in Easy mode from now on. You got the taste of it, and loved it. Now it is so much more valuable for you. 

-But why?

-Because society is scared of smart people. They tend to use others for their own gain, they can make an impact more than anyone else. So they are put through a test. If they treat people of all IQ's, ages, races, genders and backgrounds equally, they can start living life in Easy mode. And you did that. You proved you deserve to live life like this. 

We had no choice.
