**Item \#:** SCP-1961

**Object Class:** ~~Euclid~~ Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** ~~Close monitoring and a replenished space debris field posted between the 4th and 5th celestial body of their solar system.~~ ~~Induced fear of the cosmos due to repeated abductions and liberal use of class A amnestics.~~ ~~introduction of SCP-090 to the local system~~ Due to their waves of extreme technological expansion  and almost pathological need to turn anything invented into some form of weapon as well (Dr. ██ believes this is done either for curiosity's sake or as a show of strength) they have been reclassified as Keter. Further research is needed to create a valid containment. It seems SCP-1961 flourishes under challenge, every attempt to containe has lead to worse breech of prior containment. SCP-1961 has reached 2865 revolutions around their star. As such, they have successfully colonized every inhabitable region in SCP-1961's system. Observations are to be made from the behind the dwarf celestial body at the end of the system, this area has been safe thusfar, but must be scanned prior to warp in for possible SCP-1961 activity.

**Description:** Specimens of SCP-1961 vary greatly in physical features. Ranging from small class to large class creatures, width also varies, this is due to stores of energy under the skin or increased musculature. They are sapient, capable of ~~basic~~ ~~advanced~~ unknown level communication, and enjoys leisure activities ~~generally sedentary activities~~ Enjoyment of activities varies between instances of SCP-1961. Testing carried out during containment instance 2 has shown them to be extremely curious and social, as well as prone to feral violence when sufficient provocation is supplied.

**Addendum 1961-A:** Note from Dr. ██
*Due to the danger of security breaches, no more testing or implementation of attempted confinement is allowed. The most recent recorded obersvationof SCP-1961 has proven that they have now reached a tech level of 9, sufficient to detect our cloaking, though imprecise. SCP-1961 responded with a transmission blast in a wide cone directed at us. Message translation is listed in Addendum 1961-A2.*

**Addendum 1961-A2:** "We know your there. And we know you're the reason for the practically unlimited amount of metals and ice from the rock belt. Thanks for that I guess. We also know about the big [TRANSLATION UNAVAILABLE] wormhole you opened up past [TRANSLATION UNAVAILABLE] and we THINK you're the reason for the abductions in the past. Reveal yourselves and your intentions or we will fire upon you."

**Addendum 1961-B:** Note from Dr. ██ *Thoughts on releasing SCP-0001 have been considered. But I disagree. I believe the Keter classification is warranted but we can utilize SCP-1961 as an asset for further containment. They prove to be intelligent and social. Though short tempered. I do not propose to allow them free roam of the cosmos but merely a more trust oriented relationship instead of fear and restriction. They can be used to contain more dangerous SCPs and satiated at the same time. Maybe I was wrong before.*

**Addendum 1961-C:** Note from Foudation head: *Following the loss of Dr. ██s observation vessel SCP-1961 is to remaine under restrictive observation, to be done using long range scans, and Nova payloads to be armed and ready to be sent to SCP-1961s star system on a moments notice. Extreme technological growth in all areas has been observed from long range scanners. It is assumed Dr. ██s vessel was apprehended and has successfully been reverse engineered.*

**Addendum 1961-C2:** Note from Foudation head: *The whole star system has disappeared. SCP-1961 Detected the Nova payloads far before they should have. We thought they would attempt to destroy them. But they simply just vanished. Current location unknown. Tech level unknown. Danger level unknown. Pending approval of reclassification to Apollyon.*
