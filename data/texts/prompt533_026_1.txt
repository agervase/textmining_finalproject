The gathered weep softly as my last breath sighs out of my weary lungs. 

&#x200B;

Peace.

Violence.

Instinct. 

&#x200B;

My vigor briefly restored I had moved with the intensity of youth, my blade finding it's way into my hands as natural as one breaths. Perhaps it was the years of watching my back as a street urchin, perhaps it was Master Roh's incessant drilling, perhaps a small part of me wasn't as accepting of death as I had convinced myself I was. Regardless my blade flashed quick as ever, out and in just like it used to before age had slowed it a bit. 

I had needed to resorted to tricks to keep up with my spry students, another remnant of Master Roh's teachings. Her somehow gruff yet soft voice chastising, "Of course I played dirty tenderfoot, if I didn't you would never welt, and without the welts you would never learn to stop following my lead and trying to out speed me." And learn they did, not a one of them has lost but to me and each other. 

I was satisfied with my life, I had 3 pupils, I had served my king with great honor. So why did I attempt this little act of defiance?

&#x200B;

And why did it work?

&#x200B;

Sheathing my blade and passing through the still weeping congregation of family, friends, and students, I move to crouch next to the shadowy bundle that lies among them. 

"I see you wised up since you killed me."

I freeze in place, my left hand inches away from the hood that concealed her face, my right tightly on my sword. I retract my hand to trace the scar that lies where my right eye once was, the only scar I ever earned. 

Sitting down I chuckle softly, "It's a lesson you rarely get to learn, and if you do only once." 

"I honestly thought your compassion would have kept you from attempting it in the first place. I was never more proud of you than then." She turned to face me then, propping herself up with her one remaining arm grinning her devilish grin. 

The smile is wiped off my face in an instant. "You know I never wanted that fight. I hated killing you, removing that tradition was my greatest achievement, and this scar my greatest shame."

"I agree, which is why I forced it upon you. Only someone who could beat me in a fight and still maintain his heart could give the world what it needed. And you did, you got to die old and without burying 3 of your children in the process." 

She lapses into a coughing fit, black blood coating the ground in front of her. "What I didn't expect was how fast you would move when I came for you."

&#x200B;

We sat in silence, simply enjoying the brief reunion before my curiosity boiled up as it always had. 

&#x200B;

"So what now?" I ask plainly. 

"Now, I move on, and you continue the fight. Just as I did, and the man before me." 

&#x200B;

One last devilish look, "Goodbye tenderfoot."
