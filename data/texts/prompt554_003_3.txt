It is too late. You cannot stop the reign of Canada. We have been slowly yet effectively been gaining power ever since we gained independence from the British. Little known fact pions, the British never had control of us or even America for that matter. It has long been "buried" in our history books and memories of the GREAT power that once of Canada. We once had a hold of all of America and it will be ours again. The British came in declaring that they had "found the land" but we had been there for 1,000's of years awaiting their arrival. We knew they were coming. We knew that if they thought they were winning they would never expect the reality of the truth.... 

"SORRY" is just a codename that the English mistook for an apology. Idiots. It was an acronym derived form our native language Cange. It means our rise to power will be soon! It is the master plan to forever take what is really ours and now that includes the rest of the world. Who do you think gave the colonists the idea that they should be free form taxation and suggested that in rebellion to throw all of the tea overboard? We saw the unease and tension in Austria-Hungary. Who do you think created the roadblock on the street the Archduke was traveling down forcing them to take a turn toward Cabrinovicâ€™s cohorts. Also who do you think sent a message to them asking them to have a secret meeting with Serbia there? 

We, Canada, have been meticulously planning every single war and disaster that has happened. Why? Why are we doing this? Are we just evil hiding in plain sight? Is there some grand plan to our actions?  Well it turns out we posse the time stone. That's right. We have seen every timeline possible and the one we have been planning towards leads us to victory. Try to stop us. You can't.  We have all the stones actually  and as I am typing this you will slowly start to fade away because we have finally won....
