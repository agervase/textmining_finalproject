Int. A Fine Dining Establishment 

Two young attractive lovers, *Tom* and *Linda* are sharing a romantic dinner over champagne. The camera pans past waiters hustling and bustling in the background to their table where a waiter pops open a fresh bottle of champagne to refill *Linda*'s glass.  The waiter smiles and excuses himself.

**Linda**

You weren't joking about the wasabi-espresso crusted tuna.  It's fantastic!

**Tom** (smiles)

I figured you would enjoy it. After all, espresso is how we met.

**Linda**

Ha, I guess you could say that. It seems like yesterday. Has it really only been a month?

**Tom** 

A wonderful month.  

[Tom raises his champagne flutes and they share a toast.]

You know, when you bumped into me and spilled your Starbucks drink all over your new blouse I really thought you were going to get upset at me.

**Linda**

Why would I do that? It was clearly my own fault.  Besides, accidents happen.  What sort of petty person would I be to go around getting angry every time something didnt go perfectly.  It's a messy world. 

**Tom**

Oh, for sure.  Especially with that new virus going around.  But if you had gotten upset imagine how awkward it might have been when you got to the office later and discovered I was your new co-worker. 


[Linda laughs]

**Linda**
Yeah and I imagine if I was that immature I might have tried some sort of silly prank to embarrass you when you did your presentation that afternoon.  I'm sure in some alternate universe there are less emotionally grounded versions of ourselves who have spent the last month hating each other and are just now realizing how compatible we are. 

**Tom**

I didn't even think it through that far.  You think I would have done some sort of cheesey thing like try to stop you from getting on that plane for your Chicago job interview last week just so I could tell you I'd figured out that I loved you?

**Linda**

Of course not.  You'd never get past the TSA.  Don't be silly. 

**Tom**

Of course, you're right.  Well I'm just glad none of that happened. I'm pretty sure everyone around us would have found it absolutely unbearable.

**Linda**

Agreed!

[They toast again.  As their glasses clink, the sound of glass shattering comes from the front of the restaurant.   The camera whips around and a horde of undead zombies is seen spilling throughout the restaurant. ]

**Tom**

Shit!  Zombies.  Thank God we prepared!  

[Tom reaches under the table and pulls a baseball bat out of a gym bag.  Nails are hammered into the bat at odd angles.  He pulls out a sawed-off shotgun and tosses it to Linda.]

Remember to aim for the head!

[Linda cocks the gun and smiles.]

**Linda**
I love you. Now let's kick some ass!



[The rest of the movie is about zombies.]
