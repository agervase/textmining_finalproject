"What are your thoughts, Max?". Max, the de facto leader of the ragtag group of scientists now known as 'Verboten' responded with a sigh. Now that Plan A is completed, it's time to look towards moving forward with the Earth as we see it. 

"Let's begin, Dolores." says Max. "Send the alert".

Earth - a dark, hazy planet with exhausted resources. Rations and remaining resources have been loaded onto the Arks for the consumption of those leaving the planet. Approximately 30% of the population remains on Earth. With a single thermonuclear blast on both ends of the planet, the process begins after an arduous and meticulous planning spanning across 10 years where Verboten leaders were caught, interrogated, executed. None gave up the true cause. 

And now, as ships carrying the undesirables went on a long journey to Alpha Centauri where life could potentially be sustained, one wonders - did we do the right thing for the human race or did we just doom it to oblivion. Never mind - too late for that now.

A great tremor shakes the Earth as 3 billion humans activated the burrowing packages given. The Pod - A single use, protective shell that encapsulates the human and burrows deep into the Earth with ability to regulate human life for 2 weeks under - the modern version of Noah's Private Ark, a technological marvel developed without the huge coffers of the rich and privileged. Innovative-necessity. It was tried and tested but still - there could be problems. 

15 minutes passed - the plan is well beyond the point of no return. Smokescreens have been laid to ensure that the undesirables do not return with their ships and weapons. "Camouflage ready, mission is green - sir?" asked young Ashley. Ashley, Max and me - were the only ones onboard the ISS. The rest of Verboten have entrusted their future to us. We must not fail.

"Execute."

&#x200B;

The plan had gone flawlessly. Efforts to saturate the planet with multiple key ingredients to refresh Earth have been successful. A simultaneous detonation of the greatest and strongest bombs made known to mankind resulted in the complete and clean stripaway of Earth's toxic atmosphere. That, followed by the detonation of a hydrogen-oxygen fusion bomb resulted in a wash-and-clean of the Earth's troposphere.

'Cleaners'. AI bots that took in pollutants were sent to the surface and when done with their duties in cleaning the surface - have then burrowed themselves deep inside the Earth's mantel - regeneration resources such as oil and carbon for the next few generations. Rapid growth vegetation had been sprayed from the tops of the worlds and within 1 week the Earth had showed signs of recovery. If one were to say so - one would say Earth looked pre-2010. 

&#x200B;

All was great, the plan had gone to fruition. Earth will be a green haven soon again - humans would walk the surface and this time, we would do it right. We will be the smartest, wisest and benevolent species on Earth. 

"Protocol-666" buzzed the AI. "Red Alert" the screen popped. "What is this? - Quick, Ash - get to the bottom of this. We have a code red!". I ran to the machine with Ashley, what happened next was nothing short of shocking. Pods were failing and humans were not ready to be put onto the surface again with the current levels of sulfur still in the system. 

"We are losing 1% of the population every second!" - I exclaimed. "What?!" Max came running and almost barged into me. They are now both intently staring at the screen as the core leadership of Verboten is wiped out, one at a time as the Pods ran out of resources and failed. 

&#x200B;

"That's impossible! The Pods were made to last for 2 weeks! What the...." - was the last thing I heard as the door behind me shuts. The command module disengages and floats away - 2 souls floating in the middle of nowhere. I see fists hurled at the doors, a frantic look on Ashley's face as I turned on the radio to the module. 

  
"Thanks, Max. Ashley. The ships will be returning now. Earth will be new again, and your sacrifices.. 

.

.

Will be forgotten. Goodbye."
