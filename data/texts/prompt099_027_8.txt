It had been over three decades since the Xilian Collective visited Earth. They were strange hairy creatures, with beady eyes, big ears, and vestigial skin flaps under their arms. In all, they looked like alien space bats.

*"We come in peace!"*, they announced over the radio.

*"What is this, 'Mars Attacks'?"*, we collectively responded.

*"Actually, it's 'Earth vs. the Flying Saucers'. We picked up its signals a week ago. We liked it so much we decided to pay you a visit. Not all civilizations are capable of producing such high forms of art. Now take me to your leader!"*

After downloading the entirety of Netflix, the benevolent Xilians decided to leave.

*"By the way, everyone born with the same name will now share the same knowledge."*

*"Where'd you get that idea from? and how is it even possible?"*

*"Some writing prompt on reddit, and we're alien space bats."*

And they were gone.

Worldwide, it was decided to name all newborns (even the girls) *Ome*.
This was the simplest, most language-neutral, easiest to pronounce word the UN naming-council could agree upon. *Ome* won narrowly over competing names, like *Bob*, *Ju*, or *Muhammad*. Henceforth, children would be distinguished by their middle names.

The agreement was not without its detractors. Ambassador G. Walker representing Belgium had an interesting suggestion: *"Why don't we just use a few names instead of one? This way, we'll ensure that factions form. Some factions will be good at art, others at engineering, others in medicine, and so on. Parents can choose a name for their child based on which professional faction they support."*

Even a cursory analysis of Ambassador Walker's proposal was enough to reveal its ludicrous sub-optimality. Take four children, two named Abe and two named Bob. Abe #1 studies Math. Abe #2 studies English. Bob #1 studies History. Bob #2 studies Art. Both Abes are now good at Math and English, while both Bobs are good History and Art. No child is proficient in all 4 subjects.

Now take four children, all named Abe.  Abe #1 studies math. Abe #2 studies English. Abe #3 studies history, and Abe #4 studies art. All 4 Abes are proficient at all 4 subjects. This is a net gain for all children, at no loss to any.

Ambassador Walker was laughed out of the naming-council. Out of nothing more than personal spite, he decided to name his only son *Walker Jr.*, condemning him to a life of misery, never to feel the infinite wisdom of the One-Mind. In todayâ€™s world, where mere children can assemble warp drives, Walker Jr. is the equivalent of a tongueless caveman smashing stones.

*"Quite a story... It's all common knowledge, but I still like the way you put it all together."*

*"Thank you Dr. Ome, I only hope that you can change it,"* I replied.

*"We'll try our best. But I must caution you that we've only begun to scratch the surface of Xilian nomenclative syneuronics."*

*"It's my only shot, now where do I sign?"*

*"On the dotted line, Mr. Walker... or should I now call you Mr. Ome?"*
