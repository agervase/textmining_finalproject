Fuck not again I thought... I was on the way home from my last trip and in my boredom I had tapped the bus sill 4 times. You'd think I would learn after doing it so many times. It used to be fun, seeing the world, meeting new people, but now? Now I realised the pattern. Always people who need help and it's rarely exotic normally just a shopping centre or some dump somewhere. Sometimes there are exotic locations like Paris or Los Angeles or something, but normally in the back allies, the hidden corners, no glorious views nothing. The people too, the ones I helped... they would run terrified or be too drunk to help. Then I had to find my way home again. No one could help with that, sometimes I was on the opposite side of the world other times a few cities away. It was complicated living this way. Sometimes I considered being a hermit, going where the taps took me, but what sort of life is that? I'd never meet anyone, settle down, could I ever really when all I had to do was tap four times and whoosh, I'm gone.

After the dizzying experience of the all too familiar teleported faded, I found myself a top a building. Dilapidated and rotting surrounded my broken structures and rotting wood. The stench of alcohol and drugs filling the air. Great another slum somewhere and some drunk person probably about to fall over and get in trouble. It was so common, so unexciting. These people fucked their lives up why do I have to help them. Should I even bother helping them? What does it give me? 

&#x200B;

But there's the catch the fucking deal I made. " I want to be able to teleport anywhere in the world!" I said it so happily, so joyfully ready to explore the world. Then I found out the price. The "genie" who gave me these powers said "everywhere you go, someone will need your help. If you neglect to help them, you will perish and suffer as no one ever has done before." It was too late for me to say no and I paid no warning to what he said. I imagined Paris, the Eiffel tower and tapped four times. I was whisked away. Once the dizziness wore off, a person was running with a handbag a lady chasing behind. I stuck my leg out and caught the man in full stride. He dropped the bag and continued. The woman thanked me and payed $20. "Awesome I thought." 

How wrong I was. I explored the Eiffel tower and the surrounding area and figured it was time  to go home. I tapped four times picturing my room. When I came to however, my room was nowhere to be found. I was under a bridge, dark wet and musty. A voice echoing in all the crevices shouting that he was owed 20 bucks. I turned to see a man holding a boy maybe only 15 against a wall, fists raised. I walked over and asked what the issue was and the man turned, drool falling out of his mouth. "This little shit owes me 20 fucking bucks," he shouted teeth bared. I thought back to the genies words and it dawned on me what was happening. The first one was probably the genie having fun, now, now I had no choice. "Fuck" I swore under my breath and took out the 20 bucks the lady had given me and gave it to the man telling him to let the kid go. He spat at me and let the kid go, shouting it was his lucky fucking day and shit like that. He stalked off in the opposite direction. Obviously I was in Europe somewhere not fucking Australia where I lived since the money worked as well.

As time went by I started to realise that I could understand and speak in all the languages of the world, kinda. I couldn't think or pretend to speak in them and didn't know them, but when in Africa, I understood everyone and everyone understood me. Probably some bonus gift of the Genie. Also through all the problems I'd helped solve rarely was it easy or a good person it was just some drunken fuck face forgetting to pay someone back for drugs or some robbery in progress. Nothing simple or easy.

Back on the roof, I turned to find a stairway down see which fuck up needed help this time. As I walked towards the door I kicked a bucket over. It clanked and rattled. "Fuck," I said just another annoyance in this shit for storms place. A light gasp from behind the door... building? is it a building, whatever the entrance to the stairs caught my attention. I creeped around and saw a girl standing on the ledge of the building. She had turned around after hearing me kick the bucket. "W-w-who are y-y-you?" she said, tears forming in her eyes. I edged closer standing in front of her.

"Uhhhhhh... Guardian Angel. Yep that's me.. get off the edge come here," I said unsure of what the fuck I was meant to do. In all 6 years of my travelling I had never met someone about to suicide. I had no idea what I was doing but you can't just leave someone to kill themselves? Yet I was ready to give in these powers because of how monotonous and fucking dumb saving the idiots of this world were. Well here was something new... "W-what?" she said. "Where have you been through everything? Why haven't you helped before? You're just some fucking creep. LEAVE ME ALONE!" she screamed tears streaming down her face as she backed off slowly. "NO! Please, don't it's a mistake. I am here now. I'm sorry I wasn't there all those other times but I am now. I'm here to stop you making a mistake." Saying these words to her, I felt them too, the truth. I was ready to give in, to stop helping and that would've led to my "suicide" as it were. I understood now, why I couldn't stop. Was it a punishment or a trick? maybe yes, but I wouldn't give in now, not yet." 

"NO! How can I believe that things will get better? No one cares for me. My own parents probably haven't noticed me missing yet. It's better I leave this world behind," her voice faltering as she spoke, wavering in sadness.

"You don't believe that. You know you don't. You don't want to believe it and you know you have no reason to. Come with me, I'll take you home, to your parents. I promise they have been missing you." My thoughts went back to my own and what they must think. I gathered these powers at 21 and since then I'd barely visited. I lied to them about a lot, they thought I was successful and was travelling the world with money. They had no idea the only reason I didn't visit was because of the difficulties of getting home.

She slowly walked towards me. Moving away from the edge. She got down and hugged me. "Thank you guardian angel." Her tears staining my shirt. I walked with her and took her back to her house. About an hours walk away, she had left  in tears her parents calling after her. She ignored them and ran, or so she said. She couldn't handle the pressure of everything. We knocked on the door, her parents opened it eyes red and puffy. They welcomed us both in to the house, I declined and remained outside. I waved her off as she went in with her parents. She turned and smiled at me, the first time she'd smiled all night before I returned to my roaming.

Maybe what I did wasn't a bad thing and it had it's perks at times. I wasn't going to give up now. Not anymore. It wasn't worth it. I learned a lot that night. Maybe one day I'll forget it, maybe one day this gift will wear off. Until then I will roam the world where ever I am needed and help those who need it.
