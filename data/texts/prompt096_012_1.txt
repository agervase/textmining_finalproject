The three high schoolers watched Benjamin climb inside his fathers 1979 Red Chevrolet Camaro on a crisp fall night, the streets cleared for hours after the local high school football game. Kate, Trent and Sam began whispering among each other:

"He's not going to do it, he's too scared."
"He **has** to do it! It was foretold in the Book of Aztlan!" 

Benjamin heard their whispering and wiped the sweat from his hands, and then gripped the steering wheel, closed the car door and started the engine. Every fiber inside Benjamin was screaming for him to stop, turn off the car engine, anything except conjuring bloody mary on Halloween night. Benjamin reached towards the keys, and began applying pressure to turn off the car when he looked at Sam's face: anxious and astonished at Benjamin's bravery. He couldn't let her down, so he threw his hand to the stick-shift from the keys, and revved the engine, rocking the car back and forth.

"BLOODY MARY! BLOODY MARY! BLOODY MARY!" Benjamin yelled into the enclosed cabin car, and dumped the clutch sending the wheels screeching as the car lurched and rocked forward. 

The group watched the car begin to accelerate away from them as they began to hear a screeching sound coming from the opposite direction, and all three immediately turned to recognize a very determined "Bloody Mary" rapidly gaining speed on Benjamin and his car. 

Immediately Benjamin felt the instant regret filling his body as he desperately pressed the gas against the floor of his car, pushing the car to its limits in an attempt to gain any appreciable speed and avoid Bloody Mary. 

As the car began to gain speed and Benjamin began to regain his composure, suddenly he heard a loud thud against the passenger side of his car. As he looked in his passenger mirror, the unmistakeable eyes of Bloody Mary stared directly into Benjamin's soul.
