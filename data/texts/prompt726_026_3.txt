Darwin looked out of his window from the bed.  
Facing West, he could see the soft probes of the sun peering out from the uneven horizon. He exhaled just a bit.  
   
A quiet, nearly-imperceptible ping informed him that the system had become aware that he was awake and ready to go. Just like the day before and the countless days before that, he placed his feet on the floor of the room and walked to the terminal by the window.   

The system had placed him on admin duties, once again. He paused for a moment as he absorbed this, his finger scrolling rapidly over the lines of text on the screen. It didn’t matter what it said; nothing really differed much in day-to-day life here.   

Before he started towards the sanitiser, he glanced back at his bed. His partner was still asleep on her side. As her pondered whether to go over to check her schedule as well, he felt a momentary sense of panic when he realised that he couldn’t remember her name. 

Even so, he felt…. something. He couldn’t describe what it was, exactly, but he felt this instinctive need to reassure… whom? Himself? As he was rooted halfway towards his door, the system gave another soft beep. 

*Cori’s schedule has been readjusted to allow for optimal rest, to maximise probability of fertilisation. Subsystem for housekeeping will awaken her shortly 😊*

‘Of course. They couldn’t rely on just mass-incubating embryos forever. Humans were-’ He chanted to himself as the hot water flowed over him in an exceptionally violent stream. The sanitiser was still empty. None of the other occupants of his wing were awake just yet. He didn’t really bother to question the reason for that. The system likely had an eloquent reason prepared just in case he did.   

‘-social creatures. And the faster we built a semblance of family structures, like in the old world-’ The familiarity of the words, taught to them so many times over and over as they were brought up in the nurseries had a calming effect on his mind. ‘-the easier it will be going forward-’

The water stopped just then. The System was telling him that he was running late and that he needed to get moving. Darwin sighed in the sudden coolness of the room. They never did tell them what it was that they were going forward to, he realised.   

He strode through the hallway, trying to be as purposeful as he could. Crossing the door to his room was hard; he hadn’t expected that. Something apart from The System was telling him to do something, to go inside and check on that person still likely sleeping inside. 

It would have to wait until later, he thought, as he stood on the terrace of his sub-colony habitat. A hovercraft would arrive soon to take him to the other inhabitants on admin duty.   

Already, he could see stacks upon stacks of reports to examine and approve for various projects across the colony. And they weren’t just in his imagination—The System was helpfully sending him a series of briefs to his portable terminal. Even with a cursory glance, he could see that if nothing else, the colony would match the old world in terms of bureaucracy.   

A vague, unpleasant sensation gnawed at him. Darwin never really understood why this feeling of wanting time to pass quickly, for things to happen, came to him. Did it matter, in the end? If he arrived late at work, he would find that the System had already allocated his duties around to the others. If he reached early, he would find a proportionate amount of work left for him.   

So really, there wasn’t a need to feel a lack of patience at all. Yet, he still felt that way. Today he was on admin; tomorrow he could be on the dirt roads with the survey teams, searching for exploitable natural resources. Or it could be daycare, where he would have to either tend to the older first-generation inhabitants or care for the younger third- and fourth-generation.   

It was all planned out well in advance. His feelings about all of it was quite irrelevant. In any case, he had to think bigger than himself, because-  

‘-because what?’ He wondered. What was there to look forward to? Each inhabitant was just doing as they were told. None of them had any idea where all this was heading towards. And even this strange lack of patience… what was there waiting for him when he returned from work? 

‘Why was there a need to hurry’ He thought, as his legs moved unbidden towards the terrace’s exit. ‘Time is more of less infinite, every day the rest of my life’ He was moving at a brisk pace now, even working up a sweat. A couple of inhabitants, likely heading towards the fabrication labs looked at him strangely as he rushed past them.   
He ran into Cori just a couple of passages away from his wing.   

“Oh”. She said, looking surprised. Then she fumbled at her terminal and said “The System said that our next session is scheduled for later this week? Or am I mistaken?”  

“No” Darwin said, the words coming out strange. He was suddenly aware that he had walked into an awkward situation without thinking. “Um. I just wanted to tell you to have a nice day”.   

Cori stopped to consider this. “But aren’t all the days just the same? The System decides how everything works, does it not?”  

“It does” He admitted. 

"Then...?" She asked with her eyebrows raised.  
   
Maybe it was out of an impulse that had crept in, unbidden, or it a culmination of all the thoughts that had been running through his head over the past few days. But the next moment, he heard himself saying. "Yes, I know what The System does. But today-"    

He looked at her and guessed from her equipment that she was heading to one of the labs "-you're on lab duty, right? Let me give you a lift on the hovercraft."    

He motioned for her to follow him and despite an initial look of reluctance, Cori gave in.  
She asked, as walked towards the terrace. "The System won't be upset, will it?  

Darwin’s steps slowed as he considered the possibility of retribution. For some reason, the thought of facing consequences for an action committed by him woke up something buried deep inside. It stimulated, even excited him.   

He turned to her and said “No. I have a feeling that it won’t”.
