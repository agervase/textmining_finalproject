So, I was sitting in an easy chair talking with my accountant about ways to skip out on taxes.  He jokingly suggested starting a religion.

I leapt up out of my chair and yelled "Eureka!".  My accountant, befuddled, told me he was not at all serious.  I told him it had to be easy enough, I had some old sci-fi books about aliens and gods I had been trying to peddle to a publisher for years and no one will bite.  We could make those the holy texts!  We could even get people to buy in to the church for higher status through courses!  

At this point, my accountant started to get on board with the idea.  "You know, that just might work" he said, as he glared at me over his glasses.  Lots of Evangelists are doing similar things in varying degrees.

So we set out to write a rigorous code of secrecy about our new religion.  I mean, if word about it got out in the general populous, they would surely yank our tax exemption immediately!  Who would believe some crap about aliens being gods and all the bupkus that was in those books anyway?  We could charge for classes to teach the texts to make extra cash off the poor sods dumb enough to buy into the BS.   I mean, look at Jonestown...people are clearly stupid enough to do damn near anything.

Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with a terminal disease and opted for this new process called cryostasis.  If it was good enough for Walt Disney, it must be good enough for me.

That was the last thing I remember, a soft blue light as the hatch closed on me.  The next thing I know I am waking up to that soft blue light, and my head is pounding.  I am looking up at a very different group of people than I last saw before.  

The eldest of the 4 men in lab coats walked forward and asked if I knew who I was.  It took me a minute, but I nodded slowly.

"What year is it?" I asked.

The man, I presume a doctor, replied, " it is 2040 Mr. Hubbard, your followers await...
