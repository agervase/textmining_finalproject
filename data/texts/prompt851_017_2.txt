Black.

Nothing but black.

The noise was unbearable. Even though I was sure that my ear drums had been blown apart seconds ago, the noise still stood there, screaming at me. 

The blackness writhed around, ever moving. I could make out ants of all shapes and sizes near the bottom, and a ring of what seemed to be massive bees made up a large section of blackness. Those were probably the Giant Japanese hornets I had disposed of a few years back. I could make out rats, moths the size of windows, whole bee colonies swarming around, centipedes as long as I am tall, and many more unimaginable monstrosities, all blackened by the special pesticide I used.

Deer God, how am I gonna survive this?

A voice rang through my head.

"Contestant, please get ready!"

"Contestant, may the odds ever be in your favour!"

"Release the horde!"

The black mass swarmed towards me. 

"They say the best stories start with a blinding white light"

* Morgan Freeman? * I thought, as a white light in the shape of a deer's head sliced through the black swarm, lasers beaming out through the lights eyes like a state of the art point defence system. Great swaths of bugs fell to the floor as the majestic deer tore the horde apart.

"Morgan Freeman, you've came to rescue me!"

"I'm not Morgan Freeman anymore!" the deer shaped light said as it continued its path of destruction against my once horrifying foes "I am the Deer God, father of roadkill! You killed me-"

"No!" I screamed, interrupting the ghostly deer gods speech "don't kill me, please!"

"- let me finish child, please"

The last of the bugs fell.

"And I forgive you"

Some strange force surged through my body, corrupting my mind and turning my frame to steel.

"Then only one more kill to go. Vroom vroom motherfucker!"
