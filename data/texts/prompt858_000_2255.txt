"We open the door," I said, "and walk out." 

"But you can't open a door." 

"Back home, our doors are a lot lighter." 

Thranklin scoffed, a harsh sound, like angry pterodactyls mating. "What's the point of a flimsy door?"  

"Thranklin," I said, "with all due respect, questions like these are why your occupation is to follow me around moving heavy shit instead of pursuing a career of your own." 

Thranklin didn't like that very much, but then, I didn't like Thranklin very much. He was much more talkative than my previous assistant, Doug, who'd had the misfortune to walk in front of a powerbus a few weeks back.

We were rare, and thus prized; powerful, and yet unable to depress an elevator button without--

"Hnnghhhh," I said, throwing my whole weight against it.  

"Let me get that, boss," said Thranklin. I didn't like his grin.
