"A long time ago, before we were slaves to the Sura, before we taught other species to travel the stars, before The Age of Other Suns, our people were a desperate, lost species." 

"What happened?"

"A lot of it is sort of myth now. It's difficult to know exactly. What we do know is the Earth became unlivable. And it was our fault. People back then, they had no hope. Their accounts are of melting roads, power failures, rising oceans. Entire cultures were lost underwater, apparently."

"These oceans?" Raziel placed a finger on the globe on Zhuge's dresser. 

"The very same, larger of course. Anyway, we had nowhere to go, and even though we could travel to Mars at the time, there really wasn't anywhere to go locally. So our people rallied together to find a way off of the Earth." 

"Seems so strange now. We can get across the galaxy in a few hours."

"But anyway, the ships were too heavy right, so we had to find a way to get them some lift. Supposedly when we came back to the Earth some centuries later the remains of destroyed and failed ships were still there collecting dust. But we persisted."

Raziel sat on Zhuge's bed, thumbing through an ancient tome about something called "flyfishing." 

"They couldn't have known they'd succeed. Why keep trying instead of trying to save the planet?"

"My dad liked to say it was because we were strong-willed, and had a desperate need to explore. But I think--"

"Hey Zhuge, you see these, what are these, pictures of some kind? They aren't 3D! And what are these people wearing anyway? Where is this?"

"--we were too stubborn. A lot of books I read from that time talk about space. Lots of em. I think we were just stubborn ya know? We wanted to prove we could do it. It was not about saving us, it was about giving the universe a middle finger."

"But what about the pictures, Zhuge?"
