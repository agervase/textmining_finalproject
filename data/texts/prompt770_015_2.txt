“So what’s the deal with the penguin?”

I freeze half way putting a delicious warm green chili enchilada in my mouth. I look at her and she’s staring, waiting for a response.

She asks again but a little more loudly this time’, “Walt, what’s up with the penguin?” The people sitting next to us sharing a white queso look over at us.

I can’t help but think what kind of cheese that might be. It has a consistency I have never seen before. It isn’t too viscous, allowing it to drip off a crunchy chip.

“HELLO!?”

I snap out of it. “Yes?”

“The penguin?”

I don’t want to tell her she’s crazy. I try to change the subject. “Want to order that cheese?”

“Which one?”

I answer, “That one.” As I look to my right, towards the people next to us. No one is there.

“Walt, which one are you talking about?”

I look behind me and I realize we’re the only ones in the restaurant. A cold breeze creeps through my shirt which results in full body goosebumps. Suddenly, my nostrils are filled with the smell of warm white queso. I turn back. 

“Hi Walt”

It’s the fucking penguin sitting in front of me. I look furiously around for my date but I don’t see her. I realize the music has stopped. The room is silent. Not a single person in sight.

“Walt”

I look back. I’ve hallucinated the penguin my entire life but not once has it spoken a word to me. Curious I answer, “Yes?”

“What queso do you want to order?”

Confused, I answer “What?”

The penguin responds, “You said you wanted to order queso?”

A fear takes over my body. My palms start to get sweaty. I ask, “Who are you?”

It answers, “I am your internal love. I have lived quietly next to you for your entire life waiting for the moment you fell in love. Today, you fell in love. Now, I will embody your love.”

Confused, I stare at the penguin. “I fell in love with the cheese not my date”

Poof... The penguin turns into queso.
