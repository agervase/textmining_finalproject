It was just as I thought... She's a mind reader. Until now, I had assumed they were just a myth, but it turns out my tin foil hat-wearing friend was right.

I knew what I had to do. I couldn't allow an individual to have such a dangerous power.

I looked at the girl, smiled, and screamed in my head as loud as I could.

At first she looked confused, and then visibly discomforted.

It wasn't enough, I had to go LOUDER. I imagined a drill Sargent constantly yelling in my ear with a bullhorn.

When I looked back at the girl, she was instinctively covering her ears, despite its futility.

Other classmates were starting to take notice and were giving her strange looks, as well as a few looks my way for thinking so intensely, as evidenced by my spasming facial muscles.

*Still not loud enough!* I thought. I closed my eyes, cleared my mind of all other thoughts, and imagined an Army of screaming drill Sargents in the middle of an earthquake with hundreds of nuclear bombs exploding every second, and that all the noise was being channeled directly into my ears through big-ass funnels.

I kept this up for a solid minute until I was mentally exhausted from all the imaginary noise I was making. When I opened my eyes, I saw the whole class crowded around the girl, who was now unconscious.

She regained consciousness around the same time the school nurse came in to check her. As she was leaving the room with the nurse, she looked at me one last time. I said in my thoughts "If you can still read my mind, hold up two fingers."

She only held up one.

To this day I still don't know if I disabled her power or if I just really pissed her off...
