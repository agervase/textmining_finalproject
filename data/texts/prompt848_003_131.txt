It was a stupid dare. I could see that now. They say hindsight is 20/20, it's just a shame that foresight is legally blind. So Jimmy Bubkins had gotten the best of me again. It stung, I'm big enough to admit that. Of course, the realization of my own folly didn't do a whole lot to resolve the problem of my present circumstances.

Day three. I mean, day two was supposed to be purely hypothetical, and the bet had only been for three hours. But my hand had started to glow at two and I couldn't figure out a way to release the charge without causing mayhem so I just sort of...didn't. At least the look on Jimmy's face had been worth it, he couldn't even hold a charge past ten minutes, so when he saw me all glowy-fist after school he knew he'd screwed up.

But it was sort of one those winning is losing situations. Luckily it had been a Friday so I could run home after class and try to work out what to do. But nothing really came to mind and it was getting harder to harder to hide the situation from mom. Glowy fist was now full on FLAMING TERROR FIST and I could feel the strain of the charge starting to wear me down. 

Maybe mom would be, like, proud or something. I'd never heard of someone holding a charge for three days before. It had to be some sort of record. Perhaps I'd get a prize or something.

I slumped down in my chair, the blue flickering of the charge flame blazing so brightly I'd taken to wearing sunglasses. I sighed. All I needed to do was unclench my hand to release the charge, but there was no telling what it would do. I might kill everyone in the town at this point. 

I was scared. I could admit that. It was hard to tell if I was more scared of the charge or what mom would say. I glanced at my fist again, squinting even through the sunglasses. I could feel the charge building, feel the pressure to release it growing. 

I was more scared of the charge.

I drew in a deep breath, knowing that if the charge didn't kill me mom was likely to, but I couldn't wait any longer. 

"MOOOOOOOOOOOOM." I hollered out.

"What? Come down here if you want to talk to me, I'm making dinner!" She yelled back, the statement accentuated by the clanging of pots and pans.

I exhaled and then began to trudge down the stairs, the blue glow from my fist illuminating the way. Finally I walked into the kitchen. Her back was facing me as she stirred a pot of chili. 

"Hey mom, how's um...the chili coming?" I offered numbly, my fist behind my back, giving me a blue halo.

"It's a good batch. Now, what is it that you wanted?"

"I'm, sort of having a problem," I removed my fist from behind my back, my eyes welling up.

"What's that hun?" She turned around, a look of concern on her face. Almost immediately her eyes widened, "Oh my god Sam, what have you done?"

"It's Jimmy's fault! He dared me!"

"What? What did he dare you to do?"

I start crying in earnest, "He dared me to hold a charge. He said I couldn't do it for even an hour and I said I could and so I did and then I couldn't release it at school and then I got home and then I hid it all weekend and now I have a flame fist and I'm super super scared." I begin to wail, my body trembling.

Mom came over and kissed me on top of the head, "Don't worry hun, we'll take care of it. We can worry about the rest later." She was in full on mom commando mode, something I once saw her do when my sister broke her arm. She turned off the stove and picked up the phone, dialing a few numbers in and then putting it on speaker phone so I could here.

"9-1-1 Emergency, how can I help you?"

"Yes, my son has been holding a charge for three days--"

"Ma'am, this is for serious inquiries. Filing a false report--"

"YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND LISTEN TO ME," Mom screamed. It was totally epic. I wish I had gotten it on video so Jimmy could watch it, even though he wasn't my best friend any more because he tried to kill me with a dare. "HE HAS A GIANT BLUE FIREBALL AROUND HIS FIST. YOU SEND HELP OUT HERE RIGHT NOW OR HALF THE TOWN IS GOING TO BE IN RUINS."

There was a frantic clattering on the other side as the operator entered data. "Can you confirm your address is 31 Maple?" 

"Yes. I can." Mom had regained some of her composure, rearranging her hair. "Please hurry."

"I have dispatched a specialized charge unit. They should arrive within ten minutes. Please remain on the line." 

Mom moved away from the phone, and pulled me in close. I hugged her with both arms, keeping my fist tightly clenched behind her. "Don't worry Sam. You're going to be just fine. I'm sure this sort of thing happens all of the time."

"I can't believe you yelled at 9-1-1." I said, a tremor of awe entering my voice.

"Yes, well, sometimes you need to get your point across quickly, but I don't want to hear you yelling at your sister any time soon. This was a special emergency."

"I love you mom." I begin to blubber again.

"I love you too Sam." She hugged me close.
