"Good evening class. Today, I want to read to you a paper. Now, I want you all to guess who wrote this brilliant short piece for our lively little literature class."


*Professor Bartholomew Boraster cleared his throat and took a sip of his bottle, adjusting his glasses as he stood at his lectern. On the table to his right sat a stack of papers, papers he demanded by handed in, printed, by 8 pm at the end of each week. The last week's challenge had been simple- write a children's story where the child is afraid of letting go.*


*To me, the assignment was a pain. I had worked my ASS off to get into this class- Creative Writing was actually a difficult track to get into. So many amateurs believed they had the right stuff to hold their own. It was detestable how many pages of material I had to go through how many babies I had to kill... I loathed this program, but I needed it. I needed the big fancy placard with my name emblazoned on the top. But I really did not wish to waste my time and talent on a children's tale.*

*So I did the most American thing I could conceive of- I outsourced it. To the very place where I got my start, where I founded my career in meaningful shorts and lyrical prose- the subreddit /r/WritingPrompts. It was genius- I had everything planned out, and all I had do was take the highest voted and submit as my paper. There was no way the old Professor Boraster could detect me. Plagiarism was for academics- no service in the world would trawl through a subreddit for comparative studies. Comfortable in my back row seat, and laced my fingers and leaned back. The professor began his tale.*


"In the darkest alley on Suverset Boulevard,
That is where you'll find her,
In the only house where the yard still flowered.

"The people around her, they flowed without end, 
Eyes locked with the gleam of greed,
hearts cold beyond the ache of love.

"But the girl clings onto the flowers in her hand,
In the darkest alley off Suverset Boulevard,
For she has nothing more to claim as her own."


*I began to sit up as the man began to narrate the daily goings on of the girl and her flowers. The slowly creeping hints of winter. The manner in which the bees danced. The patterns they formed, the nature of their behavior slowly dawning upon the ready and the girl simultaneously.*


*Such a structure, such a prose, it was distinct, perhaps profound, perhaps too perfectly conducted... it was, of course, my paper. I was brimming with a conflated sense of pride. I owed that writer some gold when I got back to my laptop. As the man concluded, the girl was choosing to burn the flowers, say goodbye of her own accord. Did he have a tear in his eye? Damn right he did. He was reading the best post in my thread.*


*I beamed as the class clapped. I leaned forward, expecting some more praise, as Boraster looked from the paper to me. Perhaps it was the wind, but the hair at the end of my arm began to stand. Before I could even begin to understand the look he  gave me... he moved to the next notable paper.*


*He began to read the paper aloud once again. It was familiar from the very first line- it was the same story. Word for word, save a typo here or there. The person that copied it was probably a worse writer than myself, purposefully going in and smudging up the paper as needed. Wait, did that make him the better writer? No, the superior cheater. But this was bad. Very bad. My eyes twisted about the room.*


"I think by now you get the point. Ah, but wait, that does remind me of  another one," *the man said as I locked eyes with Edwin, the chinese-born student that I had never held a single long conversation with till this point.* "Ah yes, here it is," *the man lifted the next paper.* "In the darkest alley of Summerset Avenue,  that is where you'll find her..." *The man slammed the paper on the ground.* "And ANOTHER ONE," *the man lifted the next paper to the floor. To my growing horror, the man went through each paper, tossing it on the ground, his face growing increasingly red his throat swelling with his outrage.*


*Professor Boraster, red-faced, standing in the center of a maelstrom of plagiarized pages. He stroked his beard as he turned to the gathered students.* "The only student here who did NOT plagiarize her paper is Mrs. Edgars," *the man gestured to the middle aged woman seated towards the front. Her prodigious weight had only increased through out the course, and her life seemed to be increasingly scrambled as she balanced the writing heavy course with her three children.* "And she would have had full marks, simply because she went through eighteen drafts."


"Now, which one of you wrote this paper. Hands only, no voices." *This was it. My way out. If I could convince the professor the story had been mine, then I would be the victim here. There was no other way. My hand shot up. But so did three others. The rest of the class sat there, cowed by the fuming professor's rage. The man, red as a beet gestured for us to come to the front of the room. We all stood there, lined up. I looked to the others. There was one advantage I had here- nobody in this room cloud possibly know that I was the one that posted the prompt that they all, apparently, had read.*


*The Professor stood in front of us, and asked the  same question.* "Did you write this story?" *the man asked me. I blinked... I nodded my head.* "0 points," he curtly announced.* "You're lying."


*He repeated this several times. Each student received 0 points. Finally, I found my voice. If I could not persist beyond this point, then I would at least cast doubt on the Professor's position.* "W-Where's you proof!?" *I shakily asked.* "Y-you haven't given any evidence!" *I clung to my trump card.*


*Boraster looked at me, before shaking his head, and lifting his phone from his front pocket. He turned it on, and pulled up a familiar app. It was Reddit is Fun. He click on the little glowing inbox indicator, and pulled up his profile.* "Read my username," *he ordered me.* "Read it aloud."


"SAY IT!"


"Y-You are... u/MathBlaster4k."


"You're god damned right."
