When it happened 2 minutes ago, it seemed like a flash of light and then I was sitting there in a car in a city I did not recognize.

What had seemed a foreign environment, became known to me as Beijing. It did not surprise me that I had noticed the similar architecture, as I had paid attention in World History Class more than other people.

I decided to check my back pocket where I felt a lump, it must have been my wallet.

I opened it and noticed your state issued identification in what I knew was Chinese and English but I was able to read both as easy as I had the English. It seems that I retain the information of the person who existed in this body before, except the current knowledge of what I was doing and what my name was.

I knew where I was supposed to be, and as it turned out my name was "Li Wei", which had been on the ID. I also had several business cards to give out, in English and Chinese because apparently I was working for an American based company.

I decided I should probably get back into traffic with the parked car and head to work. I then punched in the address on your phone's GPS and headed there.

When I arrived at work I headed to the front desk where I took a left, knowing where to go from instinct. I headed to the elevators and stood in line.

I was the last one in the elevator and punched the number to floor 5, where I worked. When I arrived I sat down at my desk and took papers out of the Satchel I had been carrying, I then got straight to work on what looked to be a standard job for distribution of automobile parts.

On my way to work there there had been a confusion among many people, but now people were just hard at work doing what they probably would have been doing had nothing happened.

It seems like no one would even question what had happened, but this was my life now, and I couldn't complain.

(I am open to criticism, if you find any mistakes  let me know below)
