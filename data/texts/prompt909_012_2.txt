Mark laughed at the story. "Me in a wedding suit? Yeah right!", smiling and nodding his head away. But I didn't tell him it was a wedding suit. I did say " fancy" though. How could he have gotten "wedding suit" from that?

Assuring myself that I'm not in a dream right now, I smiled, shook Mark's hand and we both left. Neither of us said a word. Mark barely gave me half a smile.

I spent the rest of the day constantly thinking about our conversation, trying to find a new way to see it. There had to be a way to explain it.

I knew the magic fungus was involved in this. I wasn't in a normal state and I couldn't trust my judgement. I knew that. I have never believed in the supernatural.

Years later I spotted Mark again on a similarly funny encounter. I guess we were both ready to talk now. He remembered how I explained every detail of his dream while claiming I had it. That had freaked him out. To him it looked like I planted a dream in him. That I was playing with him. Maybe even threatening him. 

I still do not believe in the supernatural. Every change has a cause. Sure, cause-effect is still unexplainable, ununderstandable quantum shit. Unexplainable, but logically consistent. We're both humans. We're almost identical in the grand scheme of things. We even lived in the same city. We knew similar people, we did similar things. There is a cause-effect explanation for us having the same dream. I'm just not smart enough to understand it. Ten months of obsessed thinking has lead to me to have to accept that conclusion. Some things are probably best left unanswered.

My second favourite conclusion was that the magic edible somehow put both our brains, or, consciousnesses?, I guess, in the same state. Perhaps the conscious is the way to understand this spookiness. I don't know, and frankly I can't afford to spend any more time thinking about this. Smarter, more educated people are on the hunt for this truth.
