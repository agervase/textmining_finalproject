There was nothing special about my life.  
There was nothing special about my job.  

I was a perfectly ordinary person living a perfectly ordinary life with a perfectly ordinary job in a perfectly ordinary Home Depot in a perfectly ordinary little town in Alabama.  

It was perfectly ordinary for me not to suspect that when I quit my job that it would cause the whole economic of a country I have never heard of to collapse.  

"Venezuela is the name of my country," said the man in black suit who visited uninvitedly at my perfectly ordinary home.

"I know Venezuela. It is in Africa?" I invited him in and showed him to my sofa.

"South America," he pushed away a mountain of empty pizza boxes and sat on my sofa.

"But it's close to Africa I suppose?"

"It's closer to Alabama," he said with a slight frown.

"Of course it's. Say, would you like some tea?" 

"Tea would be lovely," he picked up an empty pizza box, checked it was indeed empty and put it aside with an approving nod.

My faucet was broken. I had no water. I poured some left over beer into my kettle to make some tea.

"And you are a...?" I asked nonchalantly while waiting for the beer to boil.

"I am an assassin."

"Accountant you meant?"

"No assassin. I murder people for money," he opened the empty pizza box one by one.

"I see," I checked my phone. It was dead. I remembered I spent all my phone money in pizza last month. My hand was shaking, but it could be the boiling kettle of beer I was holding. I tried to appraise if I could kill the man with the kettle. "You see... Mr. Assassin. You come to the wrong house. I have nobody I want to assassin today. And even if I want to assassin someone, I have no money to pay for your service."

"I came here to assassin you," he said apologetically.
