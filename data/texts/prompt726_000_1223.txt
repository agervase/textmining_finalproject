Some days, it's difficult to look outside.

The world inside the domes is peaceful and calm. We eat, study, and play, all in a perfect world. The grass is green, and I love the feeling as blades fold underneath my feet; the sun is warm and bright; the sky blue, never overcast.

At night, the System turns off the screens on the inside of the dome, and you can see outside. 

On the inside, green grass meets clear glass. 

On the outside, you can't even see the ground. It's covered in a swirling mist of sand. If you look above the mist - which varies in height from day to day - there's a bright sky, filled with stars.

On some nights, when the mist is high, you can see harsh sunlight wrapping around and filtering through it.

It's the most I've ever seen of the sun. The System tells us that, if the sun wasn't blocked out during the day, most of the colony would be blind within a week, even with protective lenses, and even if we never looked up.

I'll probably never see the sun. According to the System, a protective layer is being constructed around the planet, formed of several different chemicals. It'll be complete in a century, perhaps, with good fortune.

Most days, there are only a few of us that look outside. 

The rest stay in their small dormitories, sleeping to dreams of clear blue water, green grass, and a beautiful blue sky. Sometimes I wonder if they're experiencing some kind of delusion. A shared hope for a future that would never happen in their lifetimes.

I asked the System what It thought, once. It was impressed that I knew the word "delusion". 

I kneel down, face only a short distance away from the inside of the dome. The glass is thick, the sandstorm violent as it churns away just a metre from my face. For a moment, I imagine that I can see the ground. A single tear slides down my cheek.

A System droid wipes it away.
