I sighed... Looking over at the table sat my tickets for the Saints vs Man City game.

"You don't want me to go to the game?"

She nodded "You don't understand..."

"I think I do..." I smiled sadly, looking up into memories past. "I've been watching Southampton play all season." 

I grabbed my coat and made for the door. She grabbed my arm one last time weakly. 

"My love please don't..."

I took her hand softly into mine and looked deeply into her eyes. 

"I'm afraid that's what being a fan is about, especially with Southampton, through thick and thin." 

She nodded acceptance, looking down into her lap a single tear rolled down her cheek. I took her chin with my finger and lifted her gaze to mine giving her a reassuring smile. "I'm going to be ok."

Then quick as a flash I opened the door and disappeared down the lane.

"You damn fool... You damn fool..." she whispered after me.

6pm and the door smashes open. "4 fucking nil! 4 fucking nil!" I stride to the kitchen, passing the living room my wife follows in tow.

"You know what?" I say grabbing a whiskey glass and slamming it down. "I could take 4-0! We're shite! I know that, but not a single shot on target or off target. And why does Hughes insist on playing shane long every time?!!" I grab the whiskey bottle from up high.

"I tried to warn you! I tried to save you from watching that awful display! 1000 times I told you I...." She cried fully now, no longer the odd poetic tear or slight sobs but crocodile tears. Now I was crying. 

"You know what?" I said quietly now. "You can't save me, I'm a saints fan, I'll be doomed for the rest of my life." Pouring a quadruple measure I realise I'm crying too.
