The fact that the Many Worlds Interpretation seems to be correct is the only thing in this universe that has given me "faith", because without it, I would've erased my own existence in a million different ways.

I started small-time, testing the waters. Your Koreshes, Phelpses, Applewhites... little guys. I saw how their branches went, nothing big, then I went deeper.

I picked off Luthers and Buddhas and rewrote modern history. It was good... generally... but I never got rid of faith. Because there was always somebody deeper. A Jesus to a Luther, and an Abraham to a Jesus. 

So I stopped shooting, and started taking notes. Who heard what and where did HE hear THAT? I didn't realize that doing this would widen my search ad nausea. I started with soothsayers and shamans and ended up trying to peg every single stupid ape that I caught braying at the moon.

Having succeeded in this genocide, I was annoyed to find out that a lot of these same people were very good at keeping records and generally being useful reservoirs of knowledge, save for the preachy bits. I had to babysit these tribes a little, get them started on the basics and then jump forward ten years to cap the young bastard saying that his father learned how to make fire from watching an angel burn his grandpa's skull.

Let that last part sink in for a second.

I wasn't even out of the Bronze age and stories of an "Accuser" who "appears to punish the heathens" and "spreads knowledge in his wake" were already common folklore. The momentary high I got out of this was ruined by the realization that I HAD BECOME THAT WHICH I HAD SET OUT TO DESTROY!

Sorry, sorry, I'm a little... irritated.

Look, anyway, that's why I'm here now. I KNOW you were planning on having one last drink before the journey but c'mon, me, you've got to get in that time machine NOW so you can start a new timeline, set everything back to zero, and try again.

C'mon, bucko, fourth time's the charm.
