"This is it. This is the glorious day that we will take the world by storm!" 

I looked at the advisor who spoke, Admiral Whats-his-fuck, and forced my cheesiest super villain smile. The rest of the idiots were grinning as well. 


“Where have you aimed the missile, Supreme Leader?”


Another one of the jackasses was speaking now. I barely avoided gritting my teeth. As if they didn't basically tell me where to point it earlier. “The devils of the United States, of course. Have a little faith.”


I wasn't sure we even had an airplane that could make that flight, much less a missile, but they kept grinning like toddlers with stolen cookies. I so longed to silence them. 


“Begin the countdown!!!”


I couldn't even control my sigh. Who was giving the orders here, anyway? Assholes. 


“Patience, my friends. I must ensure that the world is aware that they will soon witness our greatness!” I leaned over to my press agent. “You sent out everything right? Especially the part about Trump basically being a little bitch?”


He nodded, his eyes bright, clearly approving of such apocalypse-inciting rhetoric. I returned the nod and looked up to the sky. Shouldn't there be a red white and blue missile hurtling in from somewhere by now? 


“Supreme Leader! Let us begin our domination of the world!”


I still gazed up at the blue sky, then shrugged my shoulders. I had sincerely hoped I'd given them enough warning to warrant a justified response. “Begin the countdown.”


A loud cheer rose up from the advisors, and a much less enthusiastic, but still quite loud, cheer rose up from the civilians “permitted” to witness the spectacle. 


I let out the second exasperated sigh of my evening, and surely not the last, as the missile corkscrewed away like a drunk sparrow and plunged into the ocean below. 


No one was ever going to take us seriously. Maybe if I kidnapped some actual scientists..
