I knew the black Jansport, I had carried it every day to class for the past two years. The frayed upper loop you use to hang it on something had gotten caught on jagged edge of hand rail while I was drunk at a party once. Thank goodness I decided to call an uber home and leave my car at the townhouse for the night. I was wasted. The driver, Ahmed, was one of those drivers who had all sorts of snacks and shit in the back of his car which I raided with fervor when I got in for the drive across campus to the high rises. My night wasn't over, I had needed to get rid of some of the work so I could pay for the unhealthy amount that I had ingested with some friends.

Looking at Ahmed on the stand I couldn't help but squirm in my seat hearing the state prosecution accuse him.

"Mr Hassan," the fucking ignorant bitch pontificated, "the charges against you are very serious and consequential should you be found guilty of them." She was young, almost certainly sure that nailing this case would give her career the roaring start it needed. Turning to us she informed "This man" pointing to Ahmed "not only planned to profit off of selling the controlled substance MDMA, known on the street as "molly", but through this action directly contributed to the death of BU freshman Mary Parkman."

I could see Mary's mother wince at the mention of her name, I felt my stomach fold over on itself. Molly was soo chill, and not to mention hot, I didn't know it would kill her. Mary's mother looked over at me and as we met eyes I felt like she was looking right through me. Her eyes begged. The feeling was unbearable.

I stood, only for a brief moment, my peripherals told me that the courtrooms gaze laid on the defendant Ahmed. I slowly sat back down.
