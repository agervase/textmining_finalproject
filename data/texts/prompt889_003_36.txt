I woke up to blaring alarms. A flock of pidgeons flew by, smashing violently into the wings of the aeroplane I was in. Damn this plane, I don't even know who was in the cockpit. 4 oxygen masks marked "O2" in a blood-red transparent ink dropped down from above, smacking me in the face. 

I quickly put on the mask as the plane violently shook. My mind suddenly blanked out as I stared into the small speaker embedded in the cockpit door. A side door opens. Weird white noise starts to engulf my senses.

Drop. My brain seemed to split in half. First, I took the lonely parachute in the corner and strapped myself into it. Then, I took flight. As I sailed into the sea, an island suddenly popped into view as if it was obscured by a filter. 

Pull. Instinctively, I pulled the red cord dangling helplessly beside the pack strapped firmly to my back. I looked up. Inscribed in blue on white were the words "Now it starts." in a gigantic typeface, one that was familiar, in the back of my head.

Land. My knees struck the ground and cracked violently. I happened to land in a dark, musty cave. I wrestled open the pack and found a flashlight, 2 spare double-A batteries and a pistol. Weird, how are there supplies in a parachute pack? I looked up as the plane blew into smithereens mid-air and plummeted to the ground like a fallen angel. I stared out into the land and noticed 9 planes of similar build, with no sign of civilisation in sight. Fuck. Assuming they had guns too, I quickly set up base in the cave, with no signs of life other than tinkling of water in the cave. And in my pants. I stared out into the rocky nightmare-scape, suddenly spotting a moving target.

Kill.
