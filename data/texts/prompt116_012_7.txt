As all the children started to reach puberty and develop in the more obvious ways, for me it was different. At first I did not notice and people around me began to feel the same way as I did. If I was passionate about a cause, people would rally, it feel good ... I was the leader ... the Alpha. I was so used to being the unpopular one and this power I had made me feel good. I was proud of the power it brought me and got cocky; I liked it and nothing was going to get in my way.

I started to notice that the emotions that I was feeling were being transferred to other people and the intensity was a lot higher than mine, after a year or so, I roughly worked out that that I must be passing around 100 times stronger emotions. It was happening to people around me like a outward pulsing circle, but all I could think of was how can I use this to make people fear me. The dark side called on me stronger than ever, being good was for people without power, you had to fit in like a helpless lamb! I on the other hand had the power and rightful could do whatever I wanted, who was going to step in my way ... who dared!

I hid in the chapel in our school hall, I had spent a lot of time last night watching videos that ranged in emotions. It was assembly time and once everyone was seated and into the morning singing; I closed my eyes and thought away. I imagined the most scariest thing possible and watched as the room filled with panic and the students and teachers were screaming in fear! It made me feel good and powerful, like a god; this was not enough I needed to make my life easier. Oh what could I do, what would make my life easier, oh where I could be freer than anyone else ...

It came to me I need to get money and lots of money, I set up charities and guilt tripped people into giving me all their savings, every penny of it. It was so much fun and I could buy anything I wanted, no more money worries for me! Unfortunately, the *goody two shoes* where on my case and this was becoming a bit of a nuisance. The last time a superhero nearly got hold of me, but I managed to think of something scary and this confused her and I was able to make my escape. I can feel it, they are coming together and planning something, this going to be taking up a lot of my time and I need to get a handle on these so called superheroes ... some way to outwit them ...
