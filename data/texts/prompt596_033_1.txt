They came rushing toward me.  Most of them were gigantic, and all of them were wearing bright orange unwieldy armor and masks that obscured their faces.  I didn't expect them to be so fast in the heavy attire that they were wearing, but they were upon me before I could even react. 

I did have a chance to look around at some other men lying on the ground.  These were dressed in white, and at first I thought they were dead.  It quickly became apparent that they were perhaps only stunned or in despair.  One was on his hands and knees.  

I began to fall down, doing my best to hide from the men that approached me.  I didn't want to be there.  I didn't know what I wanted.  I didn't even know where I was.  The only two things that I did know were that these men wanted to kill me, and that my name was Hin- 

The quickest man reached me before I could finish the thought.  He picked me up before my knees hit the ground and hoisted me upwards.  He turned so that he could use his shoulder and that of the man next to him as a makeshift seat for me.  I was too weak to fight them off, and when I looked down I was surprised to see that I had been wrong.  

I was also wearing orange, which meant that these men were not trying to kill me.  They were my friends.  They all flashed huge smiles upward at me and cheered my name.  I heard someone yell that he could not believe that a man of my string could have been the one to save us, but I had no clue what he was talking about.  

Eventually, they set me down, and I felt a sudden and inevitable urge to move my hips.  It was such an innate desire that I did so three times before I had a chance to stop myself from behaving so foolishly.  Although I didn't know where I was, I felt certain that I was doing something wrong.  

Suddenly, a flash of yellow flew before my eyes, and I heard a thundering voice from the sky.  It said, '15 yard penalty on Hingle McCringleberry for unsportsmanlike conduct.'
