As I lackadaisically finished and set down the glass before me, Jack's eyes widened in anticipation as I excused myself to the bathroom claiming to feel a bit nauseous. As I walked into the bathroom I see him in the reflection of a portrait's glass grinning from ear to ear and nodding at his lackey who proceeded to start heading my way. 

Great.... That gives me less time than originally anticipated, I gotta really start charging more for these outings. 

***Sigh*** 

"Hindsight is 20/20" I say to myself as I positioned behind the doorway, this was the easiest part though at least. They come in expecting just to find me dead on the floor and then extract the info from my brain.
Like seriously? Who'd have thought wiggling your ears 10,000 times would unlock the ability to scan people's minds?! Zug, that's not even the most off the wall prerequisite that I've heard of unlocking a T.K.! Evidently they even have people who can cross into different/alternate dimensions? Don't even want to imagine how they got that one... I don't know, that kinda stuff is way over my head to be honest I leave it to the A.R.M.O.R. guys, I'm just a field grunt. 

I barely have time to finish that thought as the lackey creeps through the door, his body language giving away the confusion he is more than likely feeling when he doesn't see my body on the ground... 

I look at him with a bit of sympathy as I pull the trigger of my ICER and tell him "It's really too bad that your employer doesn't let their guards eat or drink with them, would probably save me some time, and you quite a bit of pain... *Then again* that's probably exactly why they don't now that I think about it." I disarm him and leave him for the cleanup crew.

I activate my comm's as I'm walking out the bathroom and report in "Agent Ruben reporting in mission complete send in YoYo and Fitz-Simmons, over."
I finished making my way to the table, grabbing a bite off Jack's plate doing my best to avoid where Jack's head is peacefully napping. Before I can even finish his drink though I hear a ***CRACK*** and there are 4 guards tied up at the table next to me. 

"Getting slow there aren't you Slingshot?" I quipped to the slender woman now sitting next to me. 

"No I just had to pick up your slack, there were still 3 left Francis what's wrong hue getting rusty?"

I chuckled, "Well if Mack would've just gone with my plan of gassing them all first then we wouldn't be in this predicament now would we?" 

As she was getting ready to reply Fitz busts through the door wildy gesturing with his hands shouting, with Simmons not too far behind...

"World Cup?" I ask.

She nods bashfully and proceeds over to the table with Fitz getting closer I notice the one earbud in as he bends down to remove the briefcase from Jack's hand. 

As he removed the cuffs linking the case to Jack he was muttering "You'd think that these super villains would come up with a better way of keeping these things safe" 

We share a laugh and Jemma puts the analyzer in my drink "Let's see what they were trying to kill you with today Rube" the analyzer goes from a red, to blue, til finally a blinking green light and audible ding. 

"Jeez, I could've performed an autopsy faster than that" quipped YoYo. 

Jemma quickly responded "Well technically YoYo it's not an autopsy unless he's dead!" 

"Give me a tenth of a second and I can arrange that!" 

I smiled and laughed "Well maybe if you're lucky whatever's in this drink will handle it for you"

With that said Jemma opened the analyzer and started reading off the chromatography "Well it looks like they just wanted you to take a nap!" 

"Really? That's a first usually they try to load me up with enough poison to kill a entire species."

Jemma laughed "Oh, did I forget to mention it'd be one you never woke up from?"

Fitz chuckled as he was fiddling with getting the briefcase open "everlasting nap haha" he muttered before managing to get it open.

As the briefcase was opening and Jemma was talking to YoYo about enhancing her speed I thought back to how I got here, it's been 20 years working with the team and it still feels like yesterday that I was destitute and in the streets.
