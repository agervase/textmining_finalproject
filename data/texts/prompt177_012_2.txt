I went from car to car, hitting each one with the rake.

"Show yourself!" I shouted, angrily moving to the next one, and giving it a good swat.

"You sneaky little bastard, you think you can hide from me?"

No one answered, but there were still a few cars left. A window opened on one of the upper floors of the apartment house, with some irate guy calling out to me, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I ignored him and headed for the next car.

It was an old little sedan, and I hit it in the back wheel with the pointy side of my rake. The wheel cap made a bit of a clang.  
But there was also something else - a short beep.

A gleeful smile crept on my face as I took the first full-powered swing at the shabby car. "Got you!" I shouted, pulled back the rake, and started pounding the car as hard as I could.

"The fuck, lady? You crazy???" the guy from before was shouting from his safe window position, and I'm quite sure more windows were getting opened and some phones getting used while holding them the wrong way. I didn't care. I had found my target.

I hit it as hard as I could. Punched the metal ribs of the rake onto the hood, on the doors, on the windows. Raked it across the hood with my full weight behind it. But all the banging and scratching just resulted in my poor rake getting bent and the car staying untouched.

"You bastard! I told you to stay out of my garden! YOU STEPPED ON MY FOUNTAIN! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT FOUNTAIN COST ME?" I shouted at the car as my rake finally broke and I was left with a short, broken piece of wood.

Only then he finally transformed into his other self, a twenty feet high vaguely human-shaped piece of metal trying to strike a sorry, placating pose like I had any chance of actually hurting him.

"I'm sorry, I really am, I just wanted to watch some TV with you guys! I was just heading for the window. I didn't know you got that fountain, I'm really sorry!"
