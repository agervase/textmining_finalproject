I think I get why people stay silent when I come around. 

It’s funny, you know. Humans are obsessed with communication. They spend their lives coming up with faster ways to talk to other people and animals. People devote their lives to this sort of stuff. But when their life is over, no one wants to talk. 

Before they die, though, everyone’s talking. Everyone’s trying to fix them. Trying to get rid of me. 

Even when people have finally lost their battle, they don’t wish to talk. Maybe it’s intimidation. Maybe they’re sad. Maybe they’re scared. All in a day’s work. 

Every so often, though, I meet someone who’s willing to talk to me. 

He was different, though. He’s the person that came back. 

I was wandering through the halls of St. James’ Hospital, when I found him. He was sleeping peacefully. Then, the alarm started blaring. He wasn’t sleeping. Doctors and nurses rushed in and pushed his weeping parents aside. But he was slipping from between their fingers. 

His spirit stood up from his bed. I towered over him. 

“Hello!” he said cheerfully, looking up at me. “What’s your name?”

“Uh... well—“ I muttered. 

“My names Thomas,” he interrupted. 

“Nice to meet you, Thomas,” I whispered, looking at the walls of the hospital, which faded into the white pathway.  A long silence passed between us. 

“Will you hold my hand?” he asked gleefully. 

“What?”

“Mommy says it’s always good to hold hands.”

“Oh, I see. Yes, I’ll hold your hand.”

“Yay!” 

His smile shined brighter than the walls of the tunnel surrounding us. We were almost there. 

“Today was a really great day,” Thomas said. 

“Oh yeah? Why’s that?”

“Well it was Nathan’s birthday, so Dr. Ryan brought in a chocolate cake. It was really good.”

“I bet it was.”

“Then we all played games, and then I went to take a nap, and now I’m here!”

Another silence. 

“Hey, where’s Bubble?”

“Who?”

“My elephant. I want bubble. I want bubble!” He started to cry. 

“Hey, uh, kid, it’s no big deal. He’s probably, uh, waiting for you.”

But something was different. He was fading. 

“Hey, kid, where’re you going?” But he was gone. Nowhere. When I confronted my boss, even he didn’t know where Thomas had went. But it didn’t matter. He was just one person, and the days go on. 

But the next week, the same thing happened. It was the same scene, with doctors and nurses and a blaring alarm. Thomas’ spirit stood up. 

“Hi!” he said. 

“Hello, Thomas.”

And we made our way down the tunnel, him blabbering on and on about the daily shenanigans. 

And then he faded. 

And then it happened again the next week. And the next, and the next. I can’t count how long it went on for. But Thomas was always ready for me, smiling and happy to see me. The last day it happened was a very special one. 

“Hi, Mr!” Thomas said, getting up from his bed. 

“Hello, Thomas! How was your day today?”

“It was really great! It was my birthday!”

“Well that’s really special, isn’t it?” I kneeled down to his level. “How old did you turn?” He held up 4 fingers. 

“Four?! Wow, you’re really growing up.” He nodded enthusiastically. 

We made our way down the tunnel. He continued to talk. 

But this time, we made it to the end. I looked down at his hairless head and his toothy grin. 

“Hey, I’ve never been here before.” He said. 

“I know you haven’t.” I hesitated. “How about we wait till we go here? This place is really special.”

“Okay!” he said. We turned around and I let him skip ahead.

“Let’s play tag!” he shouted. So, we played tag all the way back. I almost tripped on my robes a few times, but it was more than worth it. 

When we made it to the end, the doctors had stopped. There was no alarm, and the only sound was the continuous beep of the computer next to his bed. 

“Just lie down there,” I whispered to Thomas, pointing to his bed. He laid down, and the continuous drone of the computer was replaced by individual, regular beeps. 

I turned around, and walked home.
