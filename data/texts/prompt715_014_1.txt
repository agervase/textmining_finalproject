He had been waiting for this moment for so long, but at long last, Victory was within his grasp. He could practically taste his foe's blood. He, in his full Dark Lord Regalia, summoned his lich form and proceeded to wreck devastation on his opponent, who helpless before his ice spell. Gleefully, he smote down his desperately struggling foe, who had started summoning minions in a last ditch effort to escape, only to have them caught between his ice well and his falling missiles. Finally, his opponents health gave out, and he knew VICTORY.

At long last, he had conquered his foe. At long last, he would win his prize. At long last, he, TheDarkLord, had beaten the hardest boss he'd ever met -

And then the power went out, and he was left looking at his dark monitor.

"GOD DAMMIT." The loud, feminine shriek came from the other side of the basement.

"HAH! I WIN. The power gave out after Victory was declared for me. Admit your defeat!" 

The older woman poked her head out around her three monitors, still annoyed, "I still say that it was a cheap shot and you totally took advantage of the damn balance patches that nerfed my runes. Plus, that damn armor is broken."

"Doesn't matter! Now I can date your daughter!" He did a butt-wiggle chair dance.

She rolled her eyes at his antics, but a smirk tugged at the corners of her mouth. "You can ask her and I won't say anything. Stacey honey?"

"What?"

"He wants to ask you out again."

"Did he actually beat you?"

"Yes, so now we can be tog-"

"Oh, dude," Stacey scoffed, interrupting him, "I only say that to guys who don't want to hear the word no, since no one can take my mom in GW2. Answer is still no, you're too old for me. but-" Stacey flashed a smile over her shoulder, "She obviously liked you enough to let you keep trying. And my parents are divorced!"
