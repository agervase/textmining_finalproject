Had to switch it off. Every news channel is filled with the same news. Even the shitty ESPN guys are on it but I don't think it will be legal to play sports like that. And don't get me started on all those outside my house, waiting. It's nothing like that last Sharma ji's kid who came after two years, they say he can run faster than anybody on earth and he's still 12. Imagine what this Krishna can do! Well, that Tantrik named him Krishna after all but what if it's a girl?? I know I'm going to laugh so hard!!
 
...

It should have been our decision. But, she's changed. She has gone through a lot. 15 years of hardship! 15 years 12 days to be exact since she had her last period. And before that she could not conceive even after 9 years of trying, or was it 10? we got married when we were only teens after all and it was only after the blessings of Mauja baba and his desi medicines that she got pregnant. Well, my sperm played the part as well! I guess.

I can hear her cry, it's getting louder. She's in the other room with that tantrik Baba. It hurts but she still does not want any doctor near him. Baba Mauja has asked her to endure the pain of labour. The pain which has lasted over a week now but the little devil Krishna still won't come out.

The door bell rang and I opened. It was Guddu, the traffic police guy. He's having hard time managing things outside. I can only imagine. He asked if everything is okay and I just nod. Then suddenly I hear the cry of Tantrik in the room. So loud!!
I quickly moved to the Master Bedroom, The tantrik is on the floor with his back on the wall, looking like he's seen hell. What is it, Shanti? Where is it? What happened Baba ji? The Tantrik looked shocked. He's sweating. He turns around to say something but then he sees Guddu standing beside me. What is it? Guddu asked? Baba suddenly got up and starting walking out when Guddu blocked his way asking, "atleast tell what happened?!!". Tantrik slipped past Guddu by bending over and ran like his life was on the line.
I could not understand anything. I don't see any baby. Shanti was lying motionless and won't speak to me even when I shake his hand. Is she sleeping? Or is she unconscious because of the pain? I could not feel it, the pulse. Time was lost to me.

...

So many people and the police. Even the big ministers came I think but i don't remember much. I remember burying a body. I lost my wife that day.

... 

Huh! I should have bought that EPT kit after all...

**EDIT:** My first writing ever. Done in work break. I'm good at day-dreaming them but never wrote before and now looking at it afresh, I see how hard it is to read and all. Apologies. Will contribute more and get better eventually.
