Uncle Mike had always been a strange one. Growing up, he was always in and out on his "trips". He'd leave for a while, stop by around the same time every month to drop off more of his garbage, hide in his study for a few days, and then he'd be off again. You didn't really care too much about it. You had always found ways to entertain yourself. Uncle Mike was filthy rich and if him not being around much meant you got a $5000 allowance each month, well, that was fine by you. Half of what was practically a mansion was yours for weeks at a time. Only rule was that you couldn't enter the right wing or the basement. That was Uncle Mike's. Again, it never really bothered you. A couple times you had gotten curious and peeked in to one of the "forbidden" rooms. What looked like piles of junk and garbage filled the room to the point in which you couldn't even fit in though the doorway.

*No wonder Mike didn't want anyone in here* you had thought *he lives like a fuckin slob.*

You never could bring yourself to look into the basement though. Something about it just, didn't feel right. You had shut the door then and and never bothered to go back in. That is, until today.

Uncle Mike passed away a few days ago. His funeral was held earlier today. It was a small gathering with mostly people you didn't recognize and a few people from the town coming to get a peek at the "weird rich old man who lived in the woods". Around the end of the funeral though, a woman approached you. She was middle aged and looked solemn at the passing of what you assumed was a good friend to her. She spoke with you a little about her relationship with your uncle, saying she was his pilot, Joan. 

*Figures that Uncle Mike would have his own pilot. Probably has his own personal plane too.*

After some typical small talk and the usual "sorry for your loss," Joan handed you a letter.

"He told me to give this to you if something ever happened to him," she explained "it may not make sense now, but I hope you come to understand. Your uncle was an extraordinary man."

And that gets you to where you are now. It's evening. The moon should be rising soon. Almost fitting that its a full moon tonight. Mike always liked to come home for the full moon. He said he liked the way the countryside looked under it. You scoff, he would.

You're standing outside your uncle's mysterious study, holding his unopened letter in your hands. You open the door to his study and walk in. The walls are lines with maps and news clippings. Old books, pens, papers, and Pop-Tart wrappers coat the floor. You chuckle. Mike always did really love Pop-Tarts. Looking closer at the books and newspapers though, none of it made sense. Werewolves? Demons? Magic?? It was ridiculous! This is what Uncle Mike devoted his life to? This is what he kept in his secret study?? You sigh and drop down into the single rolling chair in the study and look down at the letter.

*This is stupid,* you thought to yourself as you tore open the letter.

"Kid, if you're reading this, then somethings gone wrong and I won't be around for a while. That, or I'm dead. The point is, there's some things you gotta know and things you gotta prepare for. First of all, obviously I'm not your real uncle. Adopted you when you were a baby. Bet you probably figured that one out by now though. The way I kept avoiding the 'who are my real parents' question, you probably guessed something was amiss. No, you're real parents weren't exactly natural. Nothing I've been doing is exactly natural. Everything I've collected, all my notes, its all real. And I need you to protect it with your life. You're, well, my guard dog of sorts. You've been given immense power, given you learn to control it. And you will, around the time you hit 20. For the longest time, every month, I've been having to keep you under control for a night or two. Good thing you never remember that. I've got some nasty cuts from your claws alone--"

Your face twists in annoyance. Who does he think he is? Crazy old man! You flip to another page in the letter. Its instructions. You skim over them, face contorting in frustration.

*What, am I supposed to lock myself up in the goddamn basement every full moon until I'm 20??* You throw the letter onto the desk and stomp towards the exit of the study.

*A WEREWOLF???A GODDAMN WEREWOLF???* You grab the door handle with a clawed hand. Were your nails always that long?

*CRAZY, SENILE, LOONY, BATSHI--* And with a loud crack, you rip the door off its hinges. It flies through the air and lands on the other side of the room. You stare at it for a moment, bewildered. You did that. You, just ripped a door out. You're strong. So strong. And holy shit, you're hungry.

You begin to laugh. It was all just so crazy. He's crazy. Your laugh gets deeper. Crazy! Your laugh is rough, guttural. It's not even a laugh anymore. It's a growl. You're crazy. You're wild. You're hungry.
