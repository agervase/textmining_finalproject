The Devil went down to Georgia     
Where he got his red ass whupped     
Johnny was proud     
And he said out loud     
"I'll never be one-upped!"     

But as that challenge echoed     
Out into the Georgia blue     
The Lord jumped in          
With his violin     
Said, "It's time for round two!"

"You're getting mighty cocky,"     
Said the Lord, "Now you're in trouble!"   
"That kind of pride,    
"I won't abide!    
"It's nothing or it's double!"

Well, Johnny tightened up his strings    
He said "Don't make me groan!    
"I'll take the bet,     
"But what I get    
"Is a day upon your throne!"

There came a flash of lightning      
And the Lord said "You're all in!     
"But if you lose,     
"You'll take a cruise     
"Into oblivion!"

Johnny, now you're in too deep; that fiddle better sing!     
'Cause now you're up against the guy who made everything!     
If you win, you get a chance to rule both great and small     
But if you lose, you won't exist at all...

The Lord rosined up his bow     
And said "This will be quick!     
"I know some things     
"On Heaven's strings     
"That ought to do the trick!"

With a mighty flourish     
The Lord began his line     
And his fiddle played     
A serenade     
That was quite divine:

When the Lord had finished     
Johnny only rolled his eyes     
"If that's your best,     
"Just take a rest,    
"And witness your demise!"

The Lord, he raised an eyebrow, saying "Johnny, you've been cheating!     
"There's no sense smiting you, boy, if you can't feel the beating!"    
Johnny said "I'll tell you what, just save those declarations.    
"I'm so high, I've been playing the fiddle against hallucinations!"    
And he played:

Where did he find a golden violin?
