My little brother was far more known than I. It was his job to guide lives from the mortal realm. They even gave him a title, the "Grim Reaper." He was there at the end of every mortal's life. My job was, when someone was lost to all others' memories, to return their soul to a huge collection of energy. Perhaps then, it was fitting that I was lost to all others' memory.

Normally, each mortal dealt with my brother, and then after all who knew them passed, I then came to collect. I never really directly dealt with the mortal world.

I have recently had to begin preparations for something. Something cosmic. I'm not quite sure of the specifics. But I have had to put in more work lately. I think it's weird, but I don't particularly care. It's a change of pace.

Today was special, though.

Today, I had to visit the mortal realm.

It was strange, but I have to. As soon as I got there, I realized I didn't like it. The mortal was ubiquitously uncomfortable. I think it's because I'm not supposed to be here. But I finally pinned down the spot.

He was just sitting there. Staring blankly across the room. I'm not sure he knew I was in the room, or if he just didn't care. It's not like there was much to worry about. From what I understand, he was young, barely still considered a child. He was unclean, both in spirit and hygiene. His face showed that he had seen much, and had lost just as much.

His head turned my direction, but his face didn't change. He asked a question, but I didn't understand. Even if I did, it wouldn't change anything.

My job is to take forgotten souls. And his fit that description.

After all, who could have remembered him? There was nobody else.
