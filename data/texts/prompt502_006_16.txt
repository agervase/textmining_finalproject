**Entering Satellite Cloud – Please Refrain From Open Communications**

Aragnu: *“You would not believe the size of their walls; like impossible mountains segregating their world...”* 

Tomoisi: *“But why?  I thought the BNSFPR controls planets as wondrous and developed as this, why do they share it with their rivals?”* 

Aragnu: *“Did you ever wonder why the BNSFPR has such an odd name?  They're a conglomerate from this world.  When the Ferginar Corporation acquired Helium-3 mines in the Rigili Cluster they simply absorbed the company that owned the harvesters before them.  These Humans however...they take pride in their names; its part of their negotiations.”*

Tomoisi: *“So why do they share this planet?”*

Aragnu: *“This is where their names come from.  The TONKA, the people who designed the engine for this very ship, are from here.  The Trans-Oceanic New Kiwi Alliance holds the patents on most economy propulsion methods and as far as I know Kiwis only grow on Earth.”*

Tomoisi: *“Oh you mean those nasty furry sweet ovals?”*

Aragnu: *“Those are the ones, don't ask my why the fourth largest economic power in the galaxy named themselves after a foodstuff but like I said – its a point of pride for them these silly names.”*

Tomoisi: *“But doesn't their proximity result in unnecessary conflict, being that close to your competitor there must be constant corporate espionage?”*

Aragnu: *“Yes, how do you think the NSCIA tests and develops all its innovations...You'll see once were down there, you must always be on your guard and never speak openly about our business.”*

Tomoisi: *“I remember the training packet...only use the provided secure communications device once the ship is within sight-line of the Human satellite cloud.   I guess I'm just a little nervous, with all that currency flowing to and from this single planet, how has this whole system not just imploded on itself?  It's madness.”*

Aragnu: *“I understand your confusion, our people are one because we saw no other way, Humans see things differently.  There was a study done recently that proposes Humans are the dominant species because they haven't unified; their constant conflict and backwards engineering of their neighbors ideas, technologies, and cultures lead to them dominated all aspects of inter-species commerce.”*

**Arriving At Burlington Northern Santa Fe Pacific Rim Space Dock #74 – Please Enjoy Your Stay**

Aragnu: *“Ill see you on down there, they have this thing called pinball I think you'll enjoy, after work ill show you my favorite part about humans...they have whole regions of this planet dedicated to games”*
