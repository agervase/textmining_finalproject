"Hello?" I called out into a seemingly endless abyss.
I heard a weepy wobbly minor chord play on a harmonica behind me. There, in front of my own two eyes was the lord of darkness himself, slouched back on a rocking chair playing the blues. I trembled in his presence but noticed he was unamused by me. 
"Um, hi." I said quietly.
He spat what appeared to be lava into a spittoon that seemingly constituted itself. "What you want?" He said in a low charred voice.
"Are you...the devil?"
"You mean the ruler of the underworld, Diablo, king of the damned, foulest of the foul?
"Yeah him."
"That guy hasn't been around here for a while, looks like nobody needs him anymore. He's out of a job. It's just me, Rusty McJackoff."
I could see that he was down on his luck, so I walked over to him and went down to one knee. "There's nobody here who wants to drown my blasphemous soul in lakes of fire?" I could see his eyes light up, literally, flames appeared in his eyes, but it was to no avail.
"He's dead." Satan threw his harmonica yards into the distance and crossed his arms.
"I bet he's here. He's just...out of practice."
Satan narrowed his eyes and stuck his claw out at me, "You gonna leave like the rest of 'um?" 
I put my hands in my pockets and shrugged my shoulders, "Well, most of the people who I can't stand are in Heaven. And if I'm the only one here, maybe we can be friends for eternity." 
Satan disappeared in a cloud of smoke then reappeared in front of me, in a fine demonic suit and with a red pitch fork. "I still have to torture your soul, but we can hang out. I can promote you to demon if things go well."
"I had a feeling you'd say that. Eh, that's fine."
Satan looked at me and smiled, "Wow, you are a great guy, why did you even get sent here?"
I sighed, "I'm gay and Jewish."
Satan rolled his eyes, "You know that's bullshit. Let me check your sins...Wow, I'm impressed. Murder seems to be your favorite."
"Eh, it's a living." I grin from ear to ear.
We both high five.

End.
