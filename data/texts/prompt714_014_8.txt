-This data fragment was found in the remains of the primary north American invasion fleet which landed on or around Calumet Park, San Diego California. August 23rd 2019.

Mission Commanders* log – *date/time system not completely understood – estimated 5 days prior to invasion*

Today Archivist Quinn mentioned that we were  finally given orders from central command to begin our trip to system 7yx8-23b. a fairly interesting system with a stable main sequence star and between 8 and 14 primary orbital bodies depending on which astronomer who looks at the data you ask. But of course the one we’ve been interested in since it was discovered nearly a quarter of a galactic cycle ago, the third one. With a remarkable 71% of its surface habitable and very little sub-vacuum geological instability. Habitable water worlds that also have oxygen nitrogen subvacuums are incredibly rare, at least that is what the astronomers always say. But hey, with a usual level of galactic bureaucracy we were able to discover this planet, have it surveyed, and have a colonization plan in place in less than *approximately 450,000 earth years* who says that the empire can’t get things done quickly *subject makes an audible clicking sound*. 

Some of our biologists said that we’ll need a military presence when we arrive because of the super predators that were located in some of the areas we intended to immediately colonize. I am not a big fan of destroying local wild life, but these things are straight out of nightmares. Predators capable of swimming up to 40 km/h and are the length of 37 alphas*. I can see why they wanted some heavy machinery to help protect the farmers and colonists. One particular biologist had the audacity to suggest a recon mission, as if the recon mission we did 425,000 years ago wasn’t enough. I actually clicked out loud when he suggested that there might be some dangerous sub-vacuum creatures who could pose a threat. He was adamant, and almost got his recon mission, but the expense was deemed un-justified as not once in over 40,000 colonization’s as a sub-vacuum species ever been a threat. They simply haven’t had long enough to evolve, every school children knows this. Our society was doing geometric calculus in the deep planes of our world while the sub-vacuum life was evolving to trees. Nope, we get to fold space directly onto the ground and begin immediately out of sub-vacuum. Its just plain uncomfortable, I hate it. I have to go eat with my commanders to discuss some of these super predators and some methods for preventing predation of our colonists. 

Mission commanders log – Day of colonization. 

I have all of my troops ready and set for combat of local super predators, although I think they won’t be much of a problem. I have my platoon leaders equipped with some Spike guns which have been pretty good at keeping away large predators before, I haven’t met a single thing yet that enjoys intense electrical discharges in its general vicinity. I doubt very much we’ll need to use much lethal force on them. Once we get the nets up they won’t be a problem. I am ordering a couple full phase sweepers into the field, I highly doubt we’ll need them, but maybe one of the landing areas won’t be exactly as our geologists say and we’ll need to burn away some sub-vacuum terrain to make it a bit easier to work. I jump in just under an hour. Ill make another log with notes of what we screwed up this time so I can berate our scientists once more.

Mission commanders log – 

Emergency Log. I don’t know who screwed up, I didn’t believe it myself until my scouts pulled me from my command chair and made me look at a view screen. Sapients. Sub-Vacuum sapients! How is this even possible. Ive locked myself inside my ship while the jump drive spools up again, I have 24 minutes until its safe to jump back home. My northern colony ships are no longer responding to hails and I am no longer getting any data feeds from them. My sensor data shows that not only are there sub-vacuum sapients on this planet but that they have advanced to be an active threat to us! There are just so many of them, and they are massive. Easly 3 to 4 times the height and mass of an average alpha* When… When we landed they swarmed us there were thousands and some of them were armed. My men fired their spikes at them almost immediately and killed and injured several of them, but they returned fire with some kind of high velocity projectile round, a sub-vacuum weapon for sure, as no velocities like that are possible in full atmospheres. Most of the soldiers died as their suits were punctured and they were exposed to the low pressures. Sucked out of their own space suits; a horrible way to die. In retaliation we fired our two phase pulses. Both at full 90 degree sweeps at maximum power. They fully vaporized *an area of 1.25km in diameter from the center* but that just pissed them off. It was a stupid thing to do, I didn’t know how many of them were here. I tried launching a probe but it was intercepted by an object of considerable speed shortly afterwards and I doubt launching another will have any other result. Im setting the self destruct of this ship to exactly 1 minute after the jump drive is supposed to be ready, If I get a misfire and im unable to leave, I don’t thing the hull plating will hold out much longer than that. These sapients are advanced. Their use of the EM spectrum is sophisticated and rivals our understanding of it. Our scans of the sub-vacuum trace elements show ionizing radiation from Nuclear reaction weapons! How they haven’t figured out how to fold space is beyond me, but looking at the weapons they employ, the sophistication of their technology and their massive size, they can not get space folding tech! *a large whooshing sound is heard in the background* *rapid clicks are heard* they’re inside! We’re leaking atmosphere! The hull is breached sound the *data recording ends*

-Analysis of ship debris, data storage, and materials will be presented in future briefings.

-Designs for prototype phase 1 of E.R.B.F Drive space craft are in appendix C as well as congressional budget allocations for future program vehicles.
