"God it stinks of fish in here" Everybody looks at me with expression of confusion.

"No it doesn't Steve" I look over to the culprit his adorable furry face. A couple feet down I can see another face poking through the trenchcoat.

"Steve, so we were out with Otto last night."

"Oh right"

"I'm telling you Steve he is a great guy. He wouldn't let anyone buy drinks."

I look over to him tapping away at his keyboard. His whiskers are twitching.

Everyone is cleaning out the office but I still have work to do. Otto is still sat at his desk. I can hear them communicating with squeaks. I have only ever seen the two heads but I can tell there is at least 5. Unless they are those giant Otters from the amazon. 

Otto walks over to my desk. "Goodnight Steve" he says with his tiny voice. As he goes to leave I stop him.

"How come I am the only one who knows?"

"Sorry?"

"I can tell you are just a collection of Otters. Why can't anyone else?"

"You are right Steve, I am a group of otters. Other people do realise. I identify as human. They accept that. We live in modern times Steve."

"Wait what?"

"I am trans-species"

"Right?"

This is the first time of heard of this. I mean I guess I shouldn't judge. If Otto and his friends genuinely feel human. Do I have any right to question that? I guess not.

"You seem shocked Steve. This isn't going to affect our work relationship is it. I like you Steve and I think you are great worker."

"Aww thank you mate. Just took me back a bit, it's all new to me. Well to me as long as you're a good bloke and you work hard. You won't get any grief from me."

"Thank you Steve, it means a lot to get your approval."

I get up to leave with him. As we walk out I feel like we might be friends. 

"So Otto, tell me more about trans-species."

"Well I have a Manatee friend who drives a Forklift for UPS."
