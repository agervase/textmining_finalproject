The physicist, Al Kowski, is retaking his general relativity course for the 5th time since he never took tensor calculus. He is bored having heard the same spiel over and over, as well as feeling a bit mad going to lecture after lecture expecting to learn but never being able to understand the material.

The lost student looked out the window since he was more interested in the outside scenery such as the university clock tower than the Elvish on the chalk board. "30 more minutes till I'm free to watch 60 minutes.." He thought.

Al Kowski, still bored in class, was pretending to have a conversation with Einstein in his head complaining about how his subject can't be fathomed!
"This 4 dimensional curvature is absurd! How can massive objects bend space time! This is fairy physics!" 
Suddenly! And spontaneously without thought he hears in a very playful and thick German accent "If I can't tell yö, zen I vill schow yö".

After that, something hits Al hard! Harder than a 1000 trains hitting a wall! As sudden as a brain aneurysm! And then evanescently the sensation was null.

The weirdness of the moment was increased when Al realized he wasn't the only one who felt it.

"I.. I think we just had an earth quake." The professor stated. "That wasn't like any 6 I felt." The transfer from Berkly quipped. 
Worried and quizzical, the professor announced "I'll pick up from here next time, you all are free to go. Be safe!"

Al then looked at the university clock and noticed something was off. "Wait, that clock is off all of a sudden, class ends at 12 usually and we ended with 10 minutes to spare, why does it say 2, I just checked it 20 minutes ago." As he leaves the building he sees the room he runs into his old colleagues and finds out that they are old, and through conversation...tenured??!!

Al, never understanding the zeitgeist of his new present proceeded to live as a hermit and later died alone. :( ∎
