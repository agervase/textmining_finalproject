Anna leaned back against the scaled coils of Moss's long tail. The air was warm and dry, perfect for relaxing. She pulled out her knife and the small stump of a branch, and began carving away at it. The steady breathing of Moss and ambient noise of the forest helped Anna reach a meditative state as she shifted all of her focus onto her whittling. She managed to carve out the rough shape of a fish when Moss finally woke up. She lifted her great head and parted her jaws, letting out a silent yawn. She craned her long neck to watch Anna, who was still intently putting steel to wood. After a few moments of watching, Moss grew tired of sitting. The emerald dragon lifted the end of her tail to catch Anna's attention, but the girl's eyes were stuck on her handiwork. After a pause, the dragon twitched her tail again. This time, slapping Anna lightly on the head with her feathered tail. Anna's copper hair flipped about her face, glowing in the sunlight. She turned to face the dragon with an annoyed expression. "What?" The two connected eyes, but neither made any motion. Anna turned back to what she was doing. Moss was ready to play. Without making a sound, Moss arced her head over Anna and carefully clamped down on her oversized hood. A second later, the two were airborn. Anna screamed all of the curses she knew and flailed her limbs helplessly. Why didn't she take in a normal pet that merely yips for attention, like a cat? A nice lynx would have made a great pet. Anna's disloyal thoughts were interrupted as Moss flung Anna up and onto her back. Anna hugged the reptile's back with all of her might. She looked up just in time to see the sky turn to ground as the dragon broke into a dive. Anna let out another wail.
