Oh god. 


“Annabelle, what the hell did you do?” She desperately looks at me, “Look, Death is really nice, she said you’re good at this game.” “But what the heckin’ heck is even happening?! You’re dead!”


“Ok, when we die before our time we’re granted a chance at life if we can breath Death or Satan at a game of our choice, I chose Risk because I looked over the information hell has on you and you’re supposedly pretty good.” “And if we lose...?” She looks at me sadly. Shit. “So... losing isn’t exactly... optimal per se?”


Death snaps their fingers and a board appears “Pick your color.” I spend some time looking over them Annabelle whispers to me “Being picky? Eh?” “Look, I’m stalling for time, I wasn’t prepared for this.” Death looks at me, “It’s fine, I know this is hard for you, take your time, there is no time limit, as long as you’re here, time doesn’t pass in the physical world.” Death really is a pretty chill guy, must come with the job. “Ok, sir? Mind if we uh, have some time to discuss our strategy? Ya know, lives on the line and all that?”


Death nods, “Take as much time as you need.” They both get up and walk out.


“Annabelle. You’re insane, I love ya, but why?” “Look, we get our choice and I wanted some help, I signed the contract too fast, didn’t read it all.” By this point I’m quite exasperated. But O calm myself down, this is for my friend. “Ok... ok, let’s do this, what color do you want!” “Blue, why not?” “Great, I’ll go with red.” We take our armies, ok, general idea, “We want to centralize and put most of our stuff in one place, build a string defense, don’t want to lose in three turns, eh?” “Right, and take Australia, always take Australia.” We nod and stand over the board, completely unsure of what to do next, “We’ll figure it out?” “Yeah.”


Death and Satan come back in, Satan finally speaks “We sensed you were ready for us, good luck and may the odds be with you.”


“Shall we begin?”
