"Astronomer here!"

I paused a minute, pondering the next words. The path I had taken to get here was crazy if you thought about it. Start posting astronomy comments on a message board. Gather a following. The following grew- thousands became tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands and millions around the globe, conditioned to perk up at a catchphrase. From there it was easy- come meet her in person at AstroFest! Room for all and a great chance to rally behind science outreach!

"Astronomer here!" I repeated, after the crowds in front of the podium calmed down. "You know my love of the stars! But my friends, we are here in the shadow of The Enemy. Those against seeing the stars and truth for what they are! We are nothing in the universe, the stars will outlive us regardless of our problems on Earth!"

Another roar from the crowd. It all came down to this moment. "Astronomer here!" I shouted again, hoping the reverberations in the sound system would send the subliminal signals appropriately. "We must lead the way to solving these problems!  We have gathered here in the shadow of The Enemy, beside the State power station, for a mission! Our course is true! We must blot them out and bring back the night!"

The roar intensified, and the chants of "astronomer here! astronomer here!" let me know my mind control invention worked not only online, but in vocal recognition as well. The crowd moved from the festival grounds towards the State power station as if of their own accord, tearing at the fence and approaching the building. Once we had the power station, in the chaos dominated by only light from the beautiful shining stars above my army would stoke fear in the local government. Who controls the energy in a society controls its power. 

I smiled. "ASTRONOMER HERE!"
