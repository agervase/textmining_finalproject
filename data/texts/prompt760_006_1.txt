It started out innocently enough. 

If you watch the news, you already know this part my story. I was young, around seven or eight, and semingly overnight I went from being a below average student to acing every test. My parents and teachers were shocked. Everything spiraled out of control from there. Next came the IQ tests, then the private tutors, and when I was twelve I became the youngest person to be accepted into Harvard. I was declared a prodigy, and reporters from all over the world came to write about my story. My parents were so proud. 

I'm writing this as my confession. I'm not a genius, I barely even understand physics. I know it's a shock but I can't bring myself to lie anymore. Credit for all of my work rightfully goes to my pet chicken. 

Don't laugh, I'm telling the truth. For decades Mathmachicken has been using me as her vessel. She is the one who puts all of my brilliant thoughts into my head. The formulas, the equations, the books, all of them are of her creation. I have not had a moment's rest in years, instead I am forced to work day and night to carry out Mathmachiken's bidding. I'm am but a pawn in her master plan, something so terrible I cannot bring myself to write it down.

As I write, the numbers swirling around in my head have stopped. There is only anger. Mathmachicken is angry, she does not want me to warn you. I can hear her clicking footsteps approaching and I know my time is almost up. I hope that by warning you I can make up for the years of deceit. Stop Mathmachicken, before it's too late.

This is my first time publicly posting my writing, so I'm a little nervous. I appreciate any and all feedback!
