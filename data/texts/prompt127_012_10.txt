I rise to the sound of gunfire. The distinct crack of rifles and rat-a-tats of machine guns are my alarm clock. I don't need a motivational quote or some pithy saying to let me know I'm doing the right thing. The chaos in the street is my solemn oath to bring peace to mankind. 

I dress myself quickly, too quickly. I seem to always forget how much I disdain shaving with a shirt on. The shaving cream usually finds my collar and irks me in such a way, but regardless my face requires a razor. Life has been tumultuous to say the least but I know my plan will work. I have thought long and hard in the darkest days and hours of my life about what needs to be done. Mentioning it reminds me of the trench I called home. The mud and bodies that lined the floor. The god awful stench. My stomach convulses remembering it. 

Tonight I bring peace. Tonight I, I, end the suffering of millions. I bend the world by power of will and might. Like a strong man bending an iron bar, so I will take hold of this uncertain future and with efforts worthy of the Olympians, create a world of peace, harmony, and perfection. 

The razor slips in my hand just beneath my ear. To my amusement the blood does not trickle down my wet face in a bright red perfusion, but rather seems to instantly coagulate. I hold the razor, and stare at my face. I am not shocked, but rather intrigued. Whomever has judged me to be this vile must also be met with the same tenacity and vigor I plan to unfold. 

Tonight I cleanse the German Parliament. Tonight I save the people. History will never forget the long knives and the savior of Germany.
