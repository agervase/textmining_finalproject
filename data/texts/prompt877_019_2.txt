"What the- Mac! Dee!" Dennis shouted at the now iron curtain covered windows. "Oooooooh shit dude," charlie said sounding slightly scared." I got a bad feeling about this, Frank." Frank spins around, gun and whip at the ready. " Don't worry chally, anyone shows up and I'll whip the shit outta them. Dennis! You try to get the window open. Chally and I will start looking for the artifact." 
"Dammit Frank we talked about this. There is NO ARTIFACT....The McPoyles stole my god damn keys and -" "this is about the duster isn't it?" Charlie chimed in. " My keys are in the duster, they took the duster. So yeah it's a little bit about the duster." Dennis replied in snatchy tone. "Hey! Hello? Den, are you there?  (Are they not answering?) Shut up dee! I'm in charge of the walkie! ( I'm just worried that maybe they-) No buts Dee! Den! Den? Are you there?"
"Shit, Mac's on the walkie.." Dennis said coldly.
He then depressed the button on the walkie talkie. "The doors and windows are all locked, I need you two to find us a way out." 
"Do you have the duster? Is it secured? (Secured? Why are you acting like it's some secret mission?)" 
" Duster is still AWOL. Frank and charlie are going to check the basement now, I'm checking the main floor. Also, tell Dee to quit squaking in the walkie. If I wanted to be assaulted by birds I'd go the aviary." BANG! Dennis turned around, BANG! The noise was coming from the end of the hall. BANG! The door at the end of the hall flies open and a big unibrowed man comes out. Dennis quickly jumps in the nearest closet, hoping he wasn't seen. That's when he heard the snapping of a whip! Then a gunshot! Then another snap! Dennis peeks out of the closet just in time to see Frank whipping the shit out of the unibrowed man. "FRANK! Jesus Christ! Don't kill the guy! " He said as he came out of the closet.

I'll stop there and do more eventually haha
