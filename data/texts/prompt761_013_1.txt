 2.32am {Get to safety.}

*Shit, it’s begun.* The cover is thrown off and your feet land with a soft thud unto carpeted floor. A loud bang follows suit and you know you don’t have much time. It’s okay; you’ve prepared for this. You slip on loosened boots you’ve prepared for exactly this moment and grab the emergency rucksack you’ve stored and jump over the bed towards the window.

The bedroom door rattles violently and it’s small relief you’ve been taught to sleep with the door bolted and locked. It won’t hold for long but the precious minutes given to you are essential if you’re to succeed. You jump on the roof adjacent your window and try to make as little noise as possible as you scale down the posts and rush into your backyard.

2.35am {Stay alive.}

Gunshots ring behind you and the fence in front of you splinters at chest height. You brace both arms and ram through the fence door, grateful for the flimsy wood. You run and run and run, through neighbourhood bushes and backyards, staying away from the main roads and any accessible pathway. They may hunt you but this is your home turf, you have an advantage. Towards the thick forest you run but the yelling is getting closer to you. They were armed but you are not allowed weapons (not yet) and you understand this is meant to test you. You hate it anyway.

Finally, a tree you’ve inconspicuously marked is within your sight and you push yourself just a little bit faster, *so close, just a little bit more.* You feel relief, until a burst of pain erupts from your leg and suddenly your vision fills with leaves and dirt and the pain is overwhelming, you don’t notice you’ve fallen.

You don’t notice the flash of light overhead as they come closer to you. Still, you want to survive and you push up, not looking back to see what’s to come. Not until-

2.41am {Pray.}

Fuck.
