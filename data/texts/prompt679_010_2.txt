It's too easy to fall into the trap, being a liar. It's so rare, no one expects it. This fine gentleman? A liar? Preposterous! But of course, the fact that it looks so easy to get away with at first is the reason they get caught. You thought little lies had a way of growing bigger before, but these days a liar has no choice but to keep lying to cover up an initial lie. The truth can never come out, the story can never change, or it's game over.

I'm a liar myself, but I'm also a liar hunter. Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't hunt down a liar who doesn't abuse his ability. We didn't ask for this. Those who choose not to abuse it would be too hard to detect anyways. However, most of us do abuse our abilities. Like I said, it's too easy.

It's a bit cruel, the way the law has changed. A man's words alone can be his judge, jury, and executioner before he's even been arrested. Makes my job way easier though. I can catch and convict a perp just by talking to him in the street. In fact, the guy I'm after should be strolling in on his lunch break soon.

The door to the mellow cafe slowly wanders open, allowing a streak of sunlight to shine through onto the wall. Casting his shadow into that sunlight is none other than Mr. Liar. He looks well, successful. They're all successful. I watch him walk to the counter from my seat and he makes his order. After he sits down I grab my newspaper and get up to move to the table next to his.

"Hey there, you look like a pretty smart fellow. Think you could help me out with this puzzle in the paper?"

"Hah, a bit of an odd request from a stranger, but sure, why not?"

He's pretty good, even remembering to be honestly curt when approached. I hand him the paper, which I've actually written myself.

"Hmm, paradoxes, huh?"

He thinks for a moment and gives his answer

"This sentence is a lie."

Too easy. Even the best of them have forgotten to consider whether or not they can tell paradoxes.
