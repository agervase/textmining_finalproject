In the bed I lay, feeling my heart flatline. The beeping noises slowed down every cycle, until the oh so famous continuous long beep ensued, piercing my ears for what seemed like an eternity. I watched the faces of my son, wife and mother watch me. Soon after the eternity, everything went pitch place.

I felt anxious.. yet I could feel nothing. Spending the rest of the universes days in this place wouldn't be so bad, perhaps. Am I even conscious? Suddenly, a bright light flashes before my eyes. "This is just my brain fucking with me right now, isn't it?" I awaited for the light show to end, but it didn't. It went on for a minute, then an hour, then a day, and then a week. It didn't stop.

A voice called out, deep, yet full of light.
It said, "Ivan... come, come into the light."
I walked closer to the light, it engulfed me, filling me with glorious energy, energy I hadn't witnessed before. Soon enough, the light around me started forming objects. Big objects, small objects. I closed my eyes in anticipation. When I felt the light disappearing, I opened my eyes. 

Instead of the magnificent heavens I was yearning for, I'm greeted with desolate buildings, and old souls floating about; never to die. 

"Is this place hell? How is it any better than before?!" 

I ran about, checking every nook and cranny, until I found him. Laying down, on top of a rock. I quickly sprinted towards him, but suddenly a massive pug stepped in front of me.

"I am St. Peter, no one is allowed visit God." the pug roared. "You're St. Peter? I thought he was more, you know, human like?" I spoke.

"Well, I was. Then suddenly we get a woman coming up from earth after she died from blood loss, big bite marks. She said something about holding a "Pug Party."

"And?"

"Well, it was fancy dress so I went as a pug. Then god spoke; "You should not let that woman in here, she will be my demise!", and he then committed suicide."
