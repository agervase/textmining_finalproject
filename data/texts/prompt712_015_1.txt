A normal day, or even a normal life, for me is like a war for normal humans, in that I have horsemen of the Apocalypse for daughters. They are somehow still able to live together, despite the relationship-related fiasco.

10:00 pm, 10/4/17: Bellatroix, the gluttonous, yet ever skinny Famine-causer, managed to fuck Rocket Man, Juanice's "boyfriend", even though he is in North Korea. Juanice praises him every night saying that, "He'll save us all, cause a WAR, and conquer us all!" When she found out what happened, I wished for it to end.

Midnight, 10/5/17: Rosalie, the flat plague-carrier, gave both War and Famine AIDS, the Black Plague, and Ebola, just to calm them down. It failed, only riling them up, and Curie, the dead one, just slept through it all.

9:00 am, 10/5/17: Rocket Man is dead, so Juanice declared war on Curie. It was one-sided at best, and a massacre at worst. The whole school, including staff, had 1,500 casualties. 

11:11 pm, 10/5/17: Bellatroix had token all the fucking food from the fridge, but left me some pizza as a "stay away" note. Curie just snapped, killing all of fucking NYC for some reason. She never was truly stable...

1:01 am, 10/6/17: As some sort of payment, Curie was strapped down on the dining table, and just left there, with a piece of meat just out of reach. Juanice gave her an hour until she was to be killed, and Rosalie left some maggots in Curie's bra as a joke.

1:31 am, 10/6/17: Juanice began following the "GEOTUS", whatever that means, and got over Rocket Man pretty quickly, forgetting about Curie. The maggots have entered Curie's mouth and nose, and Bellatroix caused another famine in Syria. Rosalie caused Ebola to spread to Germany of all places, and only got Merkel.

7:00 am, 10/6/17: Curie strapped to the table notwithstanding, life has gotten back to normal. I should really start banning relationships in this household until *they* grow up...
