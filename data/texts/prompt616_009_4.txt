First a fate encountered blindly /
A grave mistake for all behind me /
For in an instant /
In a flash /
A song of reckoning rang at last /
And though the villain stood before me /
I had to leap, and without warning /
And as fell and smashed his head /
I knew for sure that he was dead /
"A hero! A hero!" The papers read /

Then one day I met another /
He took as hostage my sickly mother /
And among her many more/
The sick and dying /
The crippled poor /
I knew not the fate of all the others /
But thought only of my mother /
And with my hands around his throat /
I felt his breath leave with his ghost /
For my actions I am not proud /
But still a hero to the crowd. /

As weeks went by my burden lifted /
I'm just a man, I am not gifted /
But late one night /
Aroused from slumber /
A figure said he had my number /
He came to me and attacked with fear /
His intent soon became clear /
But in the darkness of the eve /
His widowed wife soon grieve /
Oh how I wish to take my leave /

They say there's good for every evil /
I am a hero amongst the people /
But a true hero /
Sees my facade /
And confronts me on the promenade /

Why must you kill and destroy /
Those who ensure my own employ? /
Are you the adversary I must now seek?/
What is the secret that you keep? /

I am no villain /
I am no hero /
I'm just a man /
Among the people /

As a victim of cruel fate /
Our hero leaps without debate /
First one blow /
And then a second /
This is it, I've come to recon /
In our struggle I must surmise /
That one of us will see demise /
And with my mother, weeks since gone /
I wish to end this sirens song /

But as fate would have it /
And with some chance /
Our hero falls to circumstance /
I will not run /
I will not hide /
A pale horse I vow to ride /
Despite good and despite evil /
I'm a hero to the people /
When my song is sung /
You'll be expecting /
For I am death /
And I've come collecting. 


So this was supposed to be a poem, but it looks like posting this from mobile may have fucked up my formatting.
