"How do you feel?" 

I opened my eyes, and turned my head toward the source of the voice. The silhouette was faint, and blurred, but the outline was vaguely recognizable. Whoever it was, was sitting. Relaxed.

"Porter?" 

Up and down movement. He was nodding. It was him. 

"Thought we were going to lose you there, for a moment," he said. "We got here in the nick of time."

"How am I not...gone?"

He stood up, and came closer. 

"You never need to worry again," he said. "You're supplied. For the rest of your life."

I shake my head. My thinking is...labored. Fuzzy. 

"But...why?"

"You saved her life. My daughter's. It's the least I could do." Porter shrugged. "She loves you. How could I refuse?"

"Your daughter?" 

Lightbulb. A dawning.

"Sorina? She's...your daughter? I had no idea. She spoke of a father, but..." I shake my head again, laughing a little. "I never imagined it was you."

He put his hand on my shoulder, squeezing it reassuringly. "You couldn't have known. Very few alive know our connection. And, when she ran away - when she disappeared - we didn't advertise it. Too many would have held her for ransom. For Medicine."

Porter - Sorina's father?! - helps me to sit up, propping me against the headboard. With what little energy I have, I shrug. 

"I would've done what I did even if I had known who she really is. She showed up, penniless. Begging for Medicine. I was raised to be generous, even in the face of hardship." I shrugged again. "I wouldn't have done anything different."

"I know," he said. "Even though she took advantage of you, and put you at death's door, I still wouldn't have done this if I didn't feel you were worthy. Times being what they are, and all." 

I couldn't argue with his logic. I wasn't the only one who'd been - or still was - in danger of running out of money and Medicine. The end of all things had seemed near...even more so when I felt myself starting to pass out, and then did. Sorina must have called him then. 

Everything was okay. I was alive.

Still, something was bothering me. 

"You said...she loves me."

"Yes."

"How is that possible? She barely knows me. And, as you say, she took advantage of me. Is that 'love'?"

Porter smiled, and then sighed. "The truth is, we've been watching you for a while. Sorina was your 'case officer' of sorts. We thought you'd make a suitable candidate, but...Sorina wanted to be sure. She wasn't authorized to go off-grid the way she did. She left a note that made us search everywhere but here." 

"Candidate? A candidate for what?"

Porter patted my knee, and winked. 

"All in good time, mate. All in good time."
