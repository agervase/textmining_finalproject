"Did you think, that after all this time, I would come quietly?" I stared Death down, a madness fierce in my eyes. My blood raced as it hadn't in nearly a quarter of a century, but my hands were as steady as they had always been, ever since the first time I gripped a blade. All crafts martial were my calling, and since the earliest days of my memory I trained and honed my skill to become the finest artist of my era. Over one thousand men fell to my blade throughout my life, not once was I defeated in combat. 'This was the way I shall exit this life,' I thought, 'with fury and freedom in equal measure.'

"Come on then, do what you've come to do" I spat to the spectral visage before me. Death said nothing, and for what felt to me a long time it didn't even move, no hint of humanity on what could barely be considered a face, an etheral smoke filled a space that looked uncannily like a weathered human skull. Then, almost impercetibly, Death nodded, a rare sign of respect from an eternal being. 'Death out to recognize me, I've sent plenty of souls his way over the years.' I grinned at the thought. 

Death approached again scythe raised, its frame flashed towards me faster than any man had before. I barely rolled out of the way of the swing of the enormous shythe in its hands, making a tight arc with my blade as i did so, and so when I came to face Death's rear, I had managed to slash off a small portion of the cloak it wore. As it fell to the floor, I was able to distinctly observe the tip of my blade pass through what had to of been Death's left headquarter, but there was no resistance, no apparent sign that the blade had passed through more than air. I raised my blade again, but my breathing was hard and short. Age had caught up to me, there was no way I could sustain this any longer. 
"ENOUGH!" I bellowed, and I charge towards Death, blade tip forward and a scream issuing gorth from every fiber of my being. 
Death turned to face me, and I would swear it smiled.
