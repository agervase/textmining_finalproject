  

I sighed as I gazed down at the slowly flexing human arm in my hands, shaking my head as I reached back into the bucket of brackish water to grab a bright orange cloth. After giving the arm a good scrub, I brought it up to my lips took a hearty bite, making sure to suck up all the juices before they could spill out of the wound. The zombie I was in the midst of eating had very little reaction, as always; they tend to only react when there was something living nearby, and there currently wasn’t. Even being eaten wouldn’t stir them up much, unless it made a big enough mess to attract more.

After chewing and swallowing, I resisted the urge to pluck the hairs from between my teeth – there would only be more in the next few bites anyway. It tasted somewhat like nearly expired chicken, and badly needed more salt, which I kept forgetting to get more of. Of course, if I didn’t wash the arm before eating it, it would taste a heck of a lot better (all that sweat and dried blood would be delicious), but I had still had some standards… I may not be human anymore, or at least not exactly human, but that doesn’t mean I want to eat food that has been rolling in filth for who knows how long.

I looked down that the zombie I had knocked over to get breakfast, wondering if I should just finish him off – but the problem with that was that there were very few ‘clean’ ways to kill off something that was already dead… and making a mess of the poor bastard would just draw more zombies over and risk starting a frenzy. I suppose I could just eat the brain instead of the arm, but I hadn’t worked myself up to trying that yet... some mental barriers are just way too hard to cross.

After I had finished breakfast I tied a rag around the brand-new gaping wound in the zombie’s forearm, grabbed my bucket, and got ready to face the evening! The sun had just finished setting a few minutes ago, and I had the whole night ahead of me to try and find some survivors.
