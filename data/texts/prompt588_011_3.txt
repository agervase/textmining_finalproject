This is my first try at this, I am not always the best at grammar so give me a shot.

Let's set up our spot here on the beach my mom says, we can get Sparky and Mya under the umbrella so they don't overheat. Sounds good, I replied to mom and step dad. We started enjoying the beach like we always do. Mya the crazy of the two pugs always likes to look for something dead to roll in as Sparky the older pug just like to sit and watch the ocean and to be left alone.

My step father wants to go for a walk with mom and the pugs, so I stay behind to watch over everything so no one steals our stuff. I wait awhile and notice that just mom and the pugs are coming back to the spot, I ask mom were my step dad went and she says her and the pugs helped him with his cancer and he has passed away. I soon start wonder if this is a dream I am having, but continue like nothing is wrong. We continue having fun on the beach and mom says that she wants to take a walk down the beach with pugs and I insist I want to go with her and she says maybe another time, you have to stay behind and take care of everything.

So I stay behind and take care of everything until I notice the pugs coming back by themselves and I ask Sparky were did everyone go and Sparky says to the other side of the beach, were not allowed in yet and they told us to come back to you. So we did and now we are ready for our adventures with you, so we decided to to take up pro wrestling classes in Shreveport and Sparky and Mya became my mascots as I would run ropes and take my bumps. Mya the sassy black pug even jumped off the bottom turnbuckle, as Sparky cheered on. One day I went to wrestling class and Sparky wasn't feeling well, I got a got call from my wife that Sparky insides where failing and that she thought she didn't have much time so I grabbed Mya and we drove home. 

 

We made it home and put some old wrestling matches on and Sparky and I started watching some matches I started to do color commentating and Sparky finally let go when she heard my voice. That was a year ago and now me and Mya travel the road on our adventures of wrestling. Mya now has more responsibility now being a 15 year old pug, my wife and I have a our first born on the way and Mya will be a manager to a new stable of crazy wrestling fans.
