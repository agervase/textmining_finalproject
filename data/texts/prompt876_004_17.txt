I stood at the base of the Stairway to Heaven, my mortal shell dead beneath my feet. I felt the kind light wash over my face, promising eternal happiness and joy unbound. 

As I was ascending, I could swear I heard delighted laughter of children, friendly chatter of adults, and grumpy, but heart-warming ramblings of old people. I imagined the blissful birds chirping over soft clouds, imagined the eternal warmth, the glee of meeting my family…

When I arrived at the Pearl Gate, I found it closed. I expected a welcoming committee, but maybe, that was the idea – you make your own first step to Heaven? As I pushed the gates, they opened without a sound, light as a feather. Beyond laid a garden, filled with the most beautiful plants on the Earth, including the extinct ones; beyond that I saw fountains of gold and marble, inviting me with rainbows; beyond them I saw cloudy passages over the greatest cities of the world – anyone walking could look down and see the history unfold. 

It was magnificent beyond my fantasies, but… It was deserted. There were no people here. There were no sounds beyond the splashing of the water in the fountains, no smells beyond the pollen from exotic plants. 

The Heaven was stunningly still, like Pompeii – frozen in time by some unseen threat. 

I felt my heart race as I paced down the Heaven’s passages. Still nobody around. No chatter, no shouts, no friendly banter… No sign of any man or woman. 

My path brought me to an enormous temple, rows of it’s pillars holding the sky itself. As I walked into it, the sun set, and the moon rose, drowning the temple in pale, sickly light. At the centre of the structure was a throne, upon which a man was seated, his back turned to me. I saw his white hair cascading down the back of the throne, and I felt an almost tangible sensation of power, emanating from him. 

- Hello? – I called, going around the throne. Despite never seeing Him in person, I immediately knew who it was. The God. 

He was dead. His limbs were bloodied stumps, His golden skin greyed, thinned and wracked with blackened veins, His whole frame exhausted beyond life. His eyes were dry, looking forward in constant sorrow.

My knees gave up, and I fell and wept. I cried and screamed and begged as inhuman anguish has overtaken me. 
This should not have happened. It is impossible. How can He be dead? How could people abandon Him? How…

I heard steps. I raised my teary eyes and saw a figure in a white robe approach me. His head was framed with a Crown of Thorns. He was as exhausted as his father, but he still lived. 

- You were not supposed to be here, child, - his eyes looked at me with weary surprise. – You should be in Purgatory.

- J… J-Jesus? – I asked weakly, my voice still trembling from my despair. 

- Yes, child, it is I. Come. There is nothing for you here but sadness, - he beckoned me to follow him, avoiding a 
glance at his dead father. 

I wiped my tears and caught up with him. He walked slowly, with a pace of a man without purpose, lost in his own thoughts. 

- What happened here? 

- Humanity happened, child. 

- Jesus, I… I need answers, - I touched his shoulder. - Please tell me more about this. 

He sighed. We approached the fountain, its streams creating a dancing show of a moonlight. He sat down wearily, pointing next to him. I sat down as well. 

- My father… He made a mistake, - practical blasphemy rolled from the mouth of Jesus. – He believed that humanity would find its way on its own. When you were made, he intended you to be perfect. No sins, no temptations, no mistakes. Yet when Adam and Eve fell from His grace, we were shown the error of His ways. We were shown that He could, in fact, make a mistake… The first to openly oppose my Father was Lucifer. He knew that humanity was inherently flawed, and that it should have been either fixed, or destroyed, but Father declined his qualms and cast him down to the depths of Hell for his hubris. 

- And he became Satan? – I asked, not realising I have been holding breath up to this moment. 

- Yes. He is still down there, looking over sinners, protecting Heaven and Purgatory from the worst people. All other angels did not dare argue with Father as humanity continued living on Earth. But more people in Heaven meant more problems. Heaven was supposed to be a perfect sanctuary – a place where everyone would be happy and could do whatever they wanted for all eternity. We did not account for boredom and ambition, inherent for humanity. The more people arrived – more things we had to do to entertain them and make their stay pleasant. 

Jesus sighed, looking into the fountain. A fish splashed water on his hands playfully, but received no reaction from him. 

- Father took it very close to His heart. He wanted to prove to Lucifer that he was wrong, and He worked himself to the bone. He did not sleep, did not rest, did not eat – He worked for His people, His masterpieces. And then, He sat at his throne, never to stand up again. And when He was gone, nothing held people here anymore. This place became a cemetery as humanity went to the Purgatory. Come, I shall lead you. 

I stood up and followed Jesus, our path marked by stunned silence. 
We went down the cloud passage, and I saw a city in a distance – vast beyond any imagination, buildings made of various materials and in various architectural styles rising above each other, like a vision of a mad artist. Even from a distance, I could hear noises and smell the dusty urban air. 


- Wait… - I said to Jesus. – How could He die? He is Immortal, is He not? How could He die to His own mistakes? How could He give in to His pride?

Jesus turned to me, lights of a distant city dancing in his weary eyes. 

- You were made in His image. **You** are His reflection.
