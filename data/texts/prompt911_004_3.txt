On my way to the hyperloop station that night, I held the hard disk in my hand.  It looked weird, it was rectangle shaped with a shiny metal tip at the end.  I asked GSS (Google Synapse Systems) the term video games and the information flooded in.  Apparently, these puzzle based programs were a heavy part of 1st world culture well into the 22nd century.

I sat down at my desk and set the memory stick into the analysis pod and watched my printer build out something called a 'USB' port.  The port acted like a hub, the instructions said to literally PLUG the device in.  This port was interfaced with my home system.  After I jacked the stick into the PORT, the printer began to concoct a small contraption with these strange circular sticks protruding out of the face.  I picked it up and my retina visualizers flickered on.

CRASH BANDICOOT
      'Press Start'

I pressed the right faced, rubber, crude looking button and began to get a glimpse into the later 20th century.  I had to press buttons to make the character do specific actions, the two sticks controlled the camera and movement.  It was, enthralling - my heart was beating so fast.  It was archaic but beautiful.  

"So, this is how it all began?"

I beat every program on the stick!  Crash Bandicoot, Super Mario World, Bayonetta!  As I worked my way through the library, the tiny pieces of software got more advanced and exciting.  Don't get me wrong, these 'games' are nowhere near the integrated systems technology we have today BUT they are special.

Realizing what was on this device played a crucial role into developing the modern world, I donated it to the Planetary History Archive.  They will now be uploaded and rediscovered by humanity and discovered by every planetary civilization we have come into contact with since then.

I felt proud, planting my discovery in the archives.  Maybe if we piece together enough data, we will be able to put together what really happened our ancestors.
