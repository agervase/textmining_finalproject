*Toothpaste*. 

Tch.

You don’t need *toothpaste*, or to brush your teeth at all! Don’t listen to those other 9 dentists, they’re all full of shit. They just want your money and your teeth.

Me, though... I’m honest. I don’t want anything from you except for you to keep your teeth clean and healthy.

And you don’t need fucking *toothpaste* for that.

Here’s the lowdown on toothpaste: Applied regularly to teeth, it does a spectacular job at keeping the bones protruding from your jaw sparklingly white and clean. The ingredients help to strengthen your enamel and gums, along with freshening your garlic-breath so that your girlfriend will finally agree to kiss you.

Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?

*Wrong*. 

After many years- long enough for you to trust that your innocent tube of toothpaste means you no harm... That is when it happens.

You get a cavity.

You see, there’s a secret to toothpaste that those other 9 dentists will never tell you.

They design it to eventually wear down your teeth, giving you cavities and gingivitis. You, ignorant as a lamb, go to your normal dentist, and they reassure you that everything is fine, and instruct you to continue brushing as normal.

Only this will eventually cause all of your teeth to fall out.

So you go to the dentist again, and that’s when they put you under. They claim they’re going to fill in some cavities, give you a couple of fillings. You’ll be fine in no time.

You have absolutely no idea that this was their plan all along.

Because now they can finally do what they’ve been working towards your entire life.

They’re finally going to be able to harvest your teeth.

Don’t listen to your ‘dentists’. Those tooth fairies will stop at nothing until you’re broke and toothless.

Listen to me.

Just eat a goddamn apple. That’ll clean your teeth riiiight up.

And keep those sketchy-ass doctors away, too...
