I froze. My entire life, this bag had supported me in any situation, but how could THIS be right? "Hurry up and get off if you don't have a ticket" the driver barked, "People are waiting to leave so they can get home!" I stood still like a statue, the aggressive words of passengers and the driver ricocheting off of my distraught expressions. All these people must have thought I was some sort of lunatic trying to get a free ride. "I'm sorry, let me check again sir" I finally replied to the now very irritated pilot of the shuttle. I reached back into my bag, pleading to whoever or whatever listening that it wouldn't be there. I wanted to feel the small paper stub I had hoped to grab earlier, but again my hand was met with the cold steel of a pistol. I remember thinking at the time that maybe this had been the first clue as to why my father had just vanished while I was young. Had this bag led him astray and he had to escape? If he had decided to escape the "evil intentions" of this leather bag, why would it have been entrusted to me? My thoughts were cut short by the bus driver. "Look. You NEED to leave this bus. No one has the time for you to just act like you have a ticket in that handbag of yours."

He was right. I needed to get off of the bus. If this magical bag had intended me to do something criminal, then none of these innocent passengers were safe. I apologized and stepped down from the steps as the shuttle launched off down the road. It was twelve miles from here to the family manor, but at this point all I could think about was how I needed to pay grandpa a visit. It was time that the bag of our ancestors was properly explained to me.
