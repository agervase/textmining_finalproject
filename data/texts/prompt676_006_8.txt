*God damnit*. I stare blankly at the unexpected defeat screen. I had that round. I fought carefully, maximizing the bounties of what luck came my way, ruthlessly pressing the advantage the moment it tipped in my favour. It payed off. My obnoxious foe was cornered; all I had to do was click and drag and their HP would be in the negatives.

And yet the easiest task, a mere formality of my victory, was beyond my reach. Or at least, my mouse's. The damn cursor wouldn't appear anywhere. I frantically alt-tabbed through long forgotten browser tabs and neglected essay, somehow expecting it to be hiding within. The green light indicated the battery was fine- I plugged and unplugged the usb- no change. The turn timer was ticking. My opponent must think I'm just prolonging a tasteless insult.
*Tick.* The turn ends. My opponent's forces swarm the board and steal my hard-fought victory.

**"GOD DAMNIT!"** I slam my desk in fury, jolted by the stinging riposte on my hand. A dull thud of the wall echoes it along with the muffled curses of my neighbor. I sigh, tabbing back out of the game. 2:47 AM. I flick on the lamp. Stale clothes, books, and mugs. Mummified tea bags. I absently shift my mouse. A movement, in the corner of my eye. *Oh, there the stupid fucker is.*

I slide the cursor back onto the screen, absently opening a new upload by my favorite let's player. 12 minutes later. My mouse overshoots the narrow bookmarks bar and slides past the monitor again. 

*This piece of shit...*

I stare at the cursor, hovering uselessly over my desk. I wiggle it around a bit. My sleep-deprived mind is intrigued. I move it down and click on an empty green mug. Drag. The mug follows. I twist around in my chair to follow it as it nears my trash can. Yet, the can is against the opposite wall, and the mouse only seems to move on a flat vertical plane as if an extension of the monitor. I hazard a flick of the scroll wheel, and the mug explodes against the closed door. *Hm.* 

*Maybe I should lower the sensitivity.*

But I can't be arsed, surely I'll adapt. I pick up my floppy mousepad, think better of it, and grab a clipboard with old sketches. *Let's see what else this can do...*
After a tedious struggle with much squinting of eyes and an uncomfortable wrist, I manage to pin-point the cursor on my window. *Cool. Let's open it.* Scroll up.

The window and a good bit of surrounding wall smashes into the neighbor's house. Shit. In my flustered panic I right-click and a menu pops up, all the way across the street beside the cursor. I desperately squint to try and read the far-away text, before my fidgety fingers click again. The neighbor's house disappears. *Shit shit shit.* I dive back to my keyboard and hit ctrl + z. Of course. Nothing happens.
I get an idea, trying to block out the panicked car alarm and barking dogs. I right-click the house adjacent to the now-empty lot, carefully navigate to where I think the preferred option is, and click. Nothing happens. I sigh in relief.
Then I position the cursor back to the deleted house, right click, *careful, careful,* and left-click. In utter silence a duplicated house appears, daring anyone to question that it has always been there.

*Okay. Good enough. Now maybe I can copy paste some wall back into my house.* 
However, I can't find the damned cursor. It must be in the copied house. I spend a frustrating 15 minutes slowly moving the mouse with no results. *Did it clip through the ground or something?* My patience spent, I start recklessly clicking and dragging. There's no way I can't find it in there now. Yet, no results. My anger mounts as I click with unnecessary pressure. I'm nearly knocked over by the metallic boom and the jarring snap of an oak tree down the street. There you are! I lean out the hole in my wall, see the trailer that landed on the tree, see the shower of concrete debris and misplaced vehicles about to pummel down on my location.
