Looking back, I think it all started when the sixth one moved in. Like all of us he simply appeared one day and stayed. 
Narziss he called himself, what kind of emotion ist that? But, well here he was and here he stayed. 

And I've got to admit, he did an awesome job. School became a breeze, we changed from being the nice but weird kid to the one everybody wanted to be friends with.
Oh, and he taught us, showed us the way of the world. Sometimes these were harsh truths, but I know it was necessary. Things like "I" comes first. The world is yours for the taking. They are all jealous, they begrudge you  your successes, and so on. 
And it worked, it worked so well we didn't care about the cruelties we did to look good, feel better, It made us _happy_.
All the while Narziss standing beside us, telling us we deserved to be happy, we deserved to loved. It was our right!

Time went by and we grew dependent on Narziss and his words of wisdom, we needed him. We, Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Happiness gave ourselves over to him. He didn't like Sadness, but even I don't know why Sadness ist here.

Narziss showed us new and exciting ways to be happy, to be exhilarated. And we ignored the inherent cruelties, the breaking of hearts and wills. For what does it matter, when we are feeling so good.

What formerly made us happy, now simply was boring and bleak.

Only the thrill of the hunt, the search for prey, making it trust us, radiating safety and smiling, the ever present, pleasant smile. The smile is what lures them near enough for the trap to snap.

I don't know when I started to question Narziss and his methods, but I know it myself, We can only go on without him we are nothing.
