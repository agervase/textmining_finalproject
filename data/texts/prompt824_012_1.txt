Jeremy woke up at 5 a.m. as he usually did. He made himself a usual cup of coffe, accompanied by the usual scrambled eggs. As he was sitting at the table, casually consuming his ordinary meal, he could have sworn that something was off.

He couldn't quite catch that feeling. It was mildly disturbing at the same time, partially because of its uncatchiness. He looked around the kitchen, but everything was just the same as yesterday. Even the clock showed 5:40, he was on time. Nothing seemed off. 

He finished his meal and put away the plate. This was the moment he decided to look out the window. He had at least 5 minutes to do so, because at 5:55 a.m. he should leave the apartment and go to work.  

The window revealed a quiet street, with only a couple of other clercs at the bus stop. Jeremy knew them, they were always at the stop at this time. The street clearly was not the problem. He turned around to look at the kitchen again. Everything was fine, except for the U. The giant half-transparent letter U. It crossed his sofa upside down, bent upwards touching the carpets and went up through the ceiling lights.

Jeremy was confused. He approached the sofa and tried to touch the U, but to no success. He felt nothing as his hand traversed through the U, just as if it was made out of thin air. 

Well this was unexpected. Jeremy tried to estimate the rent with this new acquisition of his. He almost fainted when he completed the calculation. Unaffordable! Unthinkable! Un... Un... Ugh. But what could he do? He couldn't even touch it! 

Jeremy shrugged and looked at the clock. It showed 6:00 a.m. and he was late. He decided to think about the U after work, hoping that the landlord would not show up today. At 6:05 a.m. he left the apartment and headed for the bus stop. Work was already on his mind. 

Poor Jeremy! Little he saw, and little he knew. The letter U was only the beginning.
