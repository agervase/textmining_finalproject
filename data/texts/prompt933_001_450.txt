The mouse pointer deleted a whole building, and no one else noticed. The skyscraper was just there, until the mouse pointer glided along and *deleted* it?

Was I on shrooms?

I hailed a elderly man near me, and asked, "Did you see that? Did you just see that mouse pointer?" 

The man scrunched up his face, backed away from me, and walked away. I shook my head, incredulous, as the mouse pointer returned again. 

It floated down to the elderly man, picked him up and threw him across the sky. He vanished into the clouds and no one reacted to him flying across the goddamn city!

What the fuck was going on? 

The mouse pointer returned, this time dropping a volcano in the middle of the town square. Countless people were crushed under its weight, but everyone else walked past it, as if it were there the whole time. 

I looked around, following the mouse pointer wherever it went. But I couldn't find its source. Is this God fucking with us? Did he finally get bored?

No, no, it had to be me. Was I going mad?

The mouse pointer returned, making curving silhouettes in the sky. When it stopped, a roller coaster track appeared in place of the silhouettes. I followed the track as it went up and down and spun in circles in multiple places. The track wound around the city, and I almost pissed myself when I saw that it ended right next to me. 

I couldn't move, held in place by some ungodly magic. The mouse pointer dropped a roller coaster on the track and let it loose. The coaster zipped on the track, its metallic screeching ringing in my ears. It disappeared behind a skyscraper, and reappeared on top of it, plummeting down the track that led to me. 

It was thirty feet away now, its red metal body all I could focus on. I couldn't even shout for help, my mouth paralysed like the rest of my limbs. 

20 feet away. 

I could feel warm liquid running down my legs. 

5 feet away. 

All of my regrets flashed before my eyes. 

2 feet. 

How painful would a death by coaster be?

1 foot. 

Fuck.
