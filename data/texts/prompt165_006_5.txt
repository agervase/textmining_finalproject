My father told me SpaceX did great things for the world, and that this is a chance anyone wouldn't get that easy. Huh, I suppose I never cared for the cosmos as much as them. 

So I went to the address inscribed on the ticket, which is also when I started considering why I haven't just sold this off. Maybe I wanted to see Dad happy like he was in his old days, running about, checking to see if any other floating rock can sustain letting humanity live for a few more centuries, and a few more centuries I wouldn't live in. I think I'll pass up the mundane bullshit they do. 

I arrive at the factory. It's not exactly large, and I think  they had ones that weren't collapsing even without a sledgehammer bashing the walls. Well, what a waste of energy. I should've stayed home and finished a book. 

Well, at least they didn't slack off on the welcome party. I am greeted by a secretary, a really hot secretary. But not like Meagan Good hot, like an office secretary hot. Maybe a younger Allison Brie or something. She stares at me, head to toe. I didn't pay any mind, this is a new suit. Should've gone with the slightly redder necktie. 

"Good afternoon sir, shall I take you to the gallery to view our products?" She says, with just a hint of fake delight, possibly that she thinks I'm her next bonus.
"Sorry, but I am here to claim the prize on this golden ticket." I pass her the ticket, and her cheerful expression suddenly turned sour, as if someone took all hope of her bonus money. 
"You see that line? Follow that and ask the concierge. 
Show them the ticket."
"Well, thank you."
"You can stop breathing around my area now, peasant."
I was about to slap her with a paycheck to buy this entire thing, but no. I have to bring Dad a story of how this plays out. Plus, I want a Roadster. Since they shut down everything including Tesla, it became exceedingly rare. And I want one.

(it's 2:30 here in our country, I'll continue this tomorrow, please tell me if i'm doing this correctly)
