Xorgon was in a heated discussion, the Galactic Council was more of a joke than something civilized.
That was, until Mother came. She just placed her hand in the gem we all have engraved in our skulls , Mother had a special one, she was the only one who could mute our voices at will and raise her volume to a screeching voice inside our brains.

Mother speaked : "At ease. It's true that they are closing in, but this council is a secure place."
They were here, spherical heads with a glass, bipedal and two arms...It didn't sound so scary the first time they came...
We tried to convey our thoughts to them by our usual method, but they seem the glass that covers their faces block them.
Or so our team thinks.
But it didn't work, those who roam our outside decimated our diplomats with a laser gun.
My brother, Zyhon, did try to use mimic and signaling to try and make the outsiders  know they were in peace...that did not work either, those monsters captured Zyhon and settled in a very primitive spacecraft.
It was as if they were mocking us, we are powerless to them.
"Those beasts may have killed our comrades, but this will not be unpunished!"
Mother raised our vocal cord volume, everyone cheered like when Ixal won the interplanetary tournament.
Thousands of voices joined together to shout : Xorgon! Xorgon!"
And so was mine, my cords were raised too for once.
But...then the dome trembled.
Our voices quivered...the beasts were pasted to the dome for quite a while but...they seemed to be moving.
A huge ball crashed into the glass.
Mother yelled : "Hide!"
But it was too late...the bipedals destroy everything they touch, we tried to escape, fight back...they were like ghosts.
We could not anticipate what they were going to do.
Were they mute? Telepaths? 
I write this hiding in the rubble that, in a couple of seconds they have created.
Be warned about the bipedals.
