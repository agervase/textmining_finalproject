On the morning of my eighteenth birthday, I woke up in excitement. I knew what this day meant. Everyone looked forward to this day. For as long as I could remember, I had longed for the day, to find out what class I was meant for.

&#x200B;

Sure, I had been training with the sword for years with my older brother, a heroic swordsman (his gift), and practiced incantations as I performed my chores with my mother, but this would be different. My brother, Erik, had glowingly told me the sword felt different as an adult. He said that in his mind, he knew what he had to do before he did it. He could see how he needed to move and how his opponent would react.

&#x200B;

Just the memory of it, made my body flush with anticipation.

&#x200B;

Several times, I had watched him practice, after he grew tired of training me at a half speed. As he dodged and weaved around imaginary targets, his body became a blur that moved so incredibly fast my eyes had trouble registering where his arm ended and his blade began.

&#x200B;

I sat up in my cot and blinked the sleepiness out of my eyes. I didn't feel different. Not yet. But that was fine. Grandfather had not been hit with his awakening until a few hours shy of sunset. Of course, he had been cursed with the gift of healing. Whenever the horses had been sick or a calf had been born premature, his grandfather had held them and soothed them into good health. With such a gift, he had been deemed too valuable to be used in defense of the manor.

&#x200B;

I shuddered at the thought, but quickly moved past it. I would not share his fate, I was confident of that.

&#x200B;

Outside, I could hear it raining. Oh well, I thought, this would be the last day I worked the farm. After today, I would be a warrior. A protector of my family.

&#x200B;

Intent on finishing my chores before my awakening, I pulled on my clothes, careful to tuck my pants inside my boots so they would not get wet. I stuck a stale piece of bread between my teeth and pulled on my coat.

&#x200B;

Upon opening the kitchen door, I saw that it was raining harder than I was expecting. Quickly closing the door to keep the rain out, I opened the closet to grab my cloak.

&#x200B;

As I began to pull it over my coat, my eyes lit upon a discarded, ragged black cloak upon the closet floor. Thinking better of risking my own cloak, I hung it back upon the closet rack and grabbed the shabby one.

&#x200B;

Splashing my way through the muddy field, feeder bucket in hand, I headed towards the stables. As I approached, I could hear the horses in distress. No doubt, the leaks in the roof were upsetting them. I cursed myself for not thinking to patch it before the rainy season.

&#x200B;

Stepping inside, I could see the horses thrashing around in their stalls. Dropping the bucket, I ran to soothe the large mare closest to me. Normally quite tame, she seemed terrified at my approach, her very eyes rolled back into white as she convulsed in the corner of her stall. Calling soothing commands to her, I reached inside the stall to pat her backside when she suddenly released a thunderous kick that send the stall door flying open and myself sprawling backwards.

&#x200B;

Aware of her newfound freedom, the mare darted out of her prison and away from me towards the back gate. In response, the horses still locked in their stalls began to whinny and thrash with newfound violence. Crashing into the locked gate, and finding it did not give way, she faced me. Her head down, she began to rush me, a frantic look in her eye that sent a jolt through my body.

&#x200B;

In a panic, I jumped to my feet and backed myself against the door. Out of fear that she would crush me, I desperately searched my fingers through the tool rack on the wall next to me. Latching on a tool with a long handle, I swung it towards the psychotic animal and felt it pass through her body. In the next instant, the beast smashed into the door. Along with the wailing of the other horses, a sickening snap rang through the air and the mare fell to the ground with a thud.

&#x200B;

In utter shock and with gaping mouth, I stared in horror at the mare, now lying still. She had passed right through me as if I had never been there at all.

&#x200B;

Still in shock at how I had been unscathed, I bent down to examine her and saw that there were white pustules forming all along her body and blood coming from her snout. Her neck had broken in the collision with the door, the likely source of the snap he had heard.

&#x200B;

A great sense of loss washed over me and I promptly turned and vomited. I retched several times before fully emptying my stomach. As I wiped my mouth and opened my eyes, I realized the stable was absolutely silent. The silence hung in the air like death. Why had the other horses gone quiet?

&#x200B;

Gathering my courage, I crept over to the stall next to the mare's. Peeking my head over, I suddenly straightened and looked in disbelief at what I saw.

&#x200B;

Writhing in silent, torturous pain, it was covered in the same pustules as the mare. Blood dripped freely from its nose and its eyes were rolled back into white. Its ribs seized in agonal breathing.

&#x200B;

Covering my mouth, I moved to the next stall and found the same thing. Making my way to each enclosure, I found the same result.

&#x200B;

Utterly defeated, I slumped against the final stall and realized I was still holding the tool I had used against the mare. A scythe. In revulsion I tried to throw it, but discovered I was unable to release my fingers from it. Standing, I began shaking my arm wildly to liberate myself but to no avail. I could slide my hand up and down the handle of the dreaded tool, but I could not free myself.

&#x200B;

Yanking my fist up the shaft of the scythe, I felt my palm brush a smooth metal plate. I paused my flailing to examine the tool. In elaborate lettering, the plate read: Plague.

&#x200B;

Plague? I felt so confused. Puzzled, I continued to stare blankly at the plate. I tilted the scythe to look for a second plate, and in doing so, angled the tool into the stall of one of the affected horses. The poor animal let out a soft, yet terrible cry and an icy dread washed over me.

&#x200B;

I understood.

&#x200B;

As understanding made its way through my mind, I became aware of a hooded figure in the stables with me. Though I had never seen this figure before, I knew inherently who it was. A comprehension that seemed to stem from deep inside my being; from something long known to mankind but deeply buried.

&#x200B;

The reality of it all was too much. My head swam and I swayed and collapsed to the floor. I watched the stable wither and rot before me and the screams of my family escaped from the manor, as it too, passed into ruin.

I struggled to separate vision from reality as the words, "You'll do" echoed through my mind.
