I stopped taking possessions years ago. Thats just incovienent for everyone. I have to go hawk the item, they have to rebuy it, its just a mess. Plus its more to carry, do you know how big my fixit bag is? Well you don't, im not doing my job if youve seen it.
No, I only take money now. And nudes. If someone leaves decent nudes out, I take them. Digital, print, whichever. I had one guy try to leave me a blockbuster gift card. I almost took it for nostalgia, but I didnt want rumors to spread that id take expired  or defunct currency. I mean, guys gotta eat.
Ive gotten word from a few sites that news outlets would pay good money to hear my story, but I figure reddit is where my people reside, so I'm putting it here for you.
It started because I needed money. You thought itd be more rich, more noble, maybe more interesting? The economy tanked, i lost my job, rent was due, i stole. But I had to sell my car so i couldn't get far, and i felt bad stealing from my neighbors, so Id fix stuff. I considered it an even trade. 
It got weird when the police reports and newscasts stopped reporting it.
It got weirder when a subreddit and craiglist adds and facebook recommendations and yelp reviews started coming in. One guy gave me one star because I didnt fix his dryer. I didnt have the parts, man!
Then the news came back around and the people they interviewed didnt even feel violated, they just figured it was a service like Uber or something, overnight repair man. 
So now I run a small, technically criminal empire. I mean, why work alone? Ive got a few people under my employ, we take tax free money and we fix things. Ive fired a few people for stealing more thans fair, and Ive hired some uniqur folks.  Weve got an app coming.  Police, you ask? Half the cops in town use our services. Helps them get more done around the house. So next time something breaks, think of us! Everyone else does!
