So there are two things about demons that don’t really show up in the mythology. 

The first is that they can scale. In the ocean, Frank (he hates that name, so I’ve stuck with it) would be enormous. In a swimming pool, he’d be about the size of a bull shark. 

In a toilet? 

Frank ends up about the size of a gold fish. 

I had just sat down when I felt a stinging pain on my right butt cheek, like a sharpened clothes pin closing on my glute. I yelped, stood straight up and grabbed at the source of the irritation.

“What the fuck, Frank?!”

This leads me to the second, and arguably more annoying habit of demons...

They. Do not. Shut. Up. 

“PIECE BY PIECE, I WILL DEVOUR YOU, JUST AS I HAVE CONSUMED YOUR ANCESTORS OVER LAST THREE HUNDRED YEARS!”

I held him by his tail up to my face.  The demonic voice emanating from something that qualified as the runt of the sushi pile was almost hilarious. 

“What bro? Are you going to nibble me to death?”

Frank blinked, which is one of the most unnerving things he does, opened his mouth to respond, thought better, and relaxed. Hanging dejectedly from my fingers, he said, “FINE. PUT ME BACK IN MY AQUARIUM.”

I pulled up my pants, wincing slightly over the fresh abrasion on my ass, and walked out to my living room. Off to the side I had a twenty gallon fish tank that served as Frank’s enclosure. Keeping him held out for a moment, I reached down and grabbed the Spongebob-themed pineapple at the bottom and pulled it out. 

“OH COME ON CHRIS! NOT MY PINEAPPLE! I CAN’T SLEEP WITHOUT MY PINEAPPLE.”

I tossed him into the tank. 

“You should have thought of that before you decided to chew on my butt cheek. No pineapple for three weeks. You’re lucky you didn’t clamp down on any, ‘low hanging fruit,’ this time, or I’d stuff you into a canteen for the next year.”

Frank grinned.

“I THOUGHT OF THAT, BUT I NEED YOU TO HAVE CHILDREN FOR ME TO DEVOUR IN THE FUTURE. AS YOU’VE GOT THE WORST APPROACH ANXIETY WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING TO WOMEN OUT OF LITERALLY ANYONE YOU’RE RELATED TO, I HAVE TO HELP YOU OUT WHERE I CAN.”

I closed the lid and gave him the finger, but there was no stopping him now.

“YOUR GREAT-UNCLE PAUL WAS GAY, AND HE HAD THREE KIDS BY THE TIME HE WAS YOUR AGE. SERIOUSLY, SIGN UP FOR A COOKING CLASS OR YOGA OR SOMETHING. I’M STARTING TO GET WORRIED.”

I tuned him out. My family had actually figured out the secret to the curse relatively early on. Frank always appears in the biggest body of water that he can jump out of and bite you from. The moment he drops onto dry land, he disappears back into  the aether until his next opportunity comes along. As long as he was in water or the air though, he couldn’t go anywhere. 

My great-grandfather was the first one to notice that little technicality. Frank came flying out of a half-full bathtub, landed on the floor, disappeared, reappeared in the bathtub and went for it again. According to the family legend, Great-Granddad just said, “fuck it,” grabbed him by his tail and that was when it all came together. After that, our whole family picked up and moved to Arizona, and then everyone bought an aquarium to toss him into. It usually keeps him occupied for a few months. 

“CHRIS! CHRIS! CHRRIIIIIIIIIIS! LOOK AT ME CHRIS!”

I sighed and turned around. 

“How the hell did you get out this time anyways? I put a brick on your lid!”

The last time Frank got out, my niece had just lobbed a water balloon at my head. The second it hit, I had a sharp-toothed guppy chewing on my eyebrow. My niece thought it was hilarious. So did Frank. 

Having a five-year old and a demon laughing at me, together? That was just too much. I kept Frank in a bong for about a year for that one. He loved it. 

Frank gave me a toothy grin. 

“THERE’S NO FUN IN IT IF I TELL YOU,” he replied. 

“Whatever dude,” I said as I flopped down onto my couch and reached for the remote.

Frank pressed his tiny little shark face against the glass of his aquarium. 

“WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?”

“New season of Vikings starts tonight.”

“FUCK YEAH. KATHRYN WINNICK IS SO HOT.”

I smiled, and turned on the tube.
