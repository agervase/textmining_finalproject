Laoi had been born with the honor of being a Sunscout. It was his duty to scour the heated lands by searching for shaded valleys which would eventually become home to rivers for his farmers or identify mountains which would let his miners burrow deep before they had to escape the arrival of the frost. 

A thousand winks of sunlight reflected off his metallic scales as he spread his enormous wings and took to the sky. He was highly regarded by his people for his scales. Only those with so few flaws could venture so far toward the sun. 

For many moons he circled with grave purpose high above the northern wastelands. In past years his people's numbers have dwindled. They had only flat land to contend with leaving them vulnerable to great electric storms as countless tornadoes ripped through every settlement and farm they strived to create. 

He had felt like such a disappointment. His people relied on Sunscouts like himself to move forward and in times of dire need he had only been turning up empty handed. Upon each arrival his silence was answer enough and echoed through the camps louder than any scream. 

But this time was different. He had prepared to head further North than he had ever flown before.  On the horizon sharp jagged peaks jetted from the ground.  They cast a dark shadow which stretched towards the other horizon. To his great surprise a small river twisted around the base of these giants. He had never seen water this far Sunward.After some time he lifted his wings to land and rested at a bank of the river. 

As he scooped water to his lips from the claws of his wings he noticed something he had never seen before. Something alive moving though the water, much different than the floodworms which flopped through the mud after a storm. It was small and had a tail like his own, but used it to swim through the water. Suddenly a thick stone-like hand locked his entire shoulder.
