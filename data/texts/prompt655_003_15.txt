I got the message yesterday. 

It read like a scholarship acceptance letter.. ironic, considering it was regarding my debt.

“Dear Eric” it read, my name written pretentiously across the top.

“I’m pleased to inform you that you have been chosen by the Marioli family to take place in their exclusive internship program. 

Your compensation for signing a contract with us will be the equivalent sum of your academic debt. 

If interested, you are expected to complete the following - 

First, please review and sign the enclosed agreement forums. Second, we ask that you deliver the signed documentation to the Marioli family directly. Compensation for distances above 20 miles is included.

The address can be found at the end of this document. 

Thank you, we look forward to seeing you.” 

The Marioli wax seal felt heavy against the papers in my hands.. 

I thought about it for a while, but in the end, I didn’t really have much of a choice. 

It never felt like I had much of a choice.. 

I reached into the top left drawer of my desk and pulled out a Nokia flip phone and a single sticky note. 

I dialed the number sprawled across. 

“Hello, Master Marioli is currently unav-“ 

“James, you know who this is. Put him on.” 

“Ah, master Eric. How nice to hear from you. Hold for just a moment please.” 

There was a pause on the line, and then a voice, a different voice than before. 

“This is Arthur Marioli. What can I do for you?” 

“I got your letter.” I said, with a shakier voice than I would have liked. 

“And?” The voice responded sternly. 

“3 years away is long enough I suppose... 

I’ll be there in 7 days, Dad.” 

“The jet will arrive at the airport in 5 days. 7AM. Do not be late.” 

The line clicked off.
