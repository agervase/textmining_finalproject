I love you Pop-Pop, my granddaughter said as she held me. I looked deeply into her eyes and saw a composure that was way beyond her years. 70 years had passed by way too soon and I had wrongly thought I would live forever. It’s the kind of thing that just hadn’t left me since childhood. I was the last real family she had and it felt like I was failing her. My time had run out just a bit too soon, but I knew somehow I would make it back here.
My eyes opened on a place I hadn’t seen in forever. I was sitting just as I had before it happened, staring at Snarlax. “How was the trip?” a voice from behind me asked. 
“I have to get back,” I screamed. 
There was this look of terror in their eyes, as if they were afraid of me.
“Give me more!” I screamed almost as if I was in a rage.
They backed away from me.
“I was the only family left for my granddaughter and I have to get back to her.”
“You’re who,” an unidentifiable voice said to me.
“My granddaughter. She was holding me as I died. She can’t become part of the system and an eventual statistic. I won’t let it happen.” I looked extremely angry.
“Listen,” Snarlax said. “What you see from the drug just isn’t real. It’s a hallucination.”
“No, I’m going to get back no matter what it takes.” I said with determination. “Give me more of the drug!” I said like I was crazy.” 
“No,” he said. “Listen, I don’t like what it did to you.”
I lunged at him claws bared and got a good swipe at him, before the others tackled me to the ground. I didn’t realize how close to death he would come.
I was charged later that day with attempted murder and that carried a 70 year sentence. That ended today and I have been released. All I could think about still was my granddaughter. Was she dead, did she become a statistic? All I knew was that I would never get to go back to that life.
