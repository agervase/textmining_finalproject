Lucifer opens his arms in a wide and you could almost see him tipping an imaginary top hat. The first thing soul number 3458231... noticed was that it was FREEZING.

3458231... says "Hey Lucy, why" \*shiver, "is it so freaking cold here"

Lucifer with a sigh on his face goes on to explain for the 3458231... time why it is so freaking cold in hell. "The big guy is up in la la land as you may remember he also is the one who has all the power, his mightiness and all that BS, well and I say this in extraordinary annoyance, no power means no energy no energy means no heat. God through me off from his high seat" at this point Lucifer is seething in rage "I, I was his most devote servant his closest friend and when he forces me to bow, bow me an angle to someone who is not his mighty royal bs he gets angry at ME, ME. I was a devote follower. So you asked why it was so cold in hell that's simple the heat is to expensive."

3458231... asked Lucy "Then why tempt people into sin"

Lucifer looked ready to rant again but sighed and said "in all honesty I just want people to eat what they want, think what they want, and be what they want, ... whatever you get the gist"

3458231... shivered again, "okay" said 3458231... looking around hell turned out to be a giant cavern with devils lying around some were sleeping and others seemed to be trying to sleep. The air felt dry and the cave felt dead. "what now Lucy" said 3458231... but Lucifer was gone. Rushing of to welcome another soul into Hell. 3458231... felt down and that made him feel tired so he sat down feeling as if all his energy was being taken away from him, "I will sit here for just one minute to gather my thoughts that's all see what do do next see whe where t" and by then 3458231... was all out of energy and he slumped down and closed his eyes.
