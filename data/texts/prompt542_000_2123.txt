"Who are you calling a hoe, Hoe?" 

We all burst out laughing. We could always count on Shovel to lighten the mood.  But, as evening became night, and the moonlight shone through the cracks in the roof of the shed, the only thing on my mind was the prophecy.

As I looked around at each one of us, I couldn't help but keep one eye on the door - watching, waiting, like we did every night. 

Was that waterlogged little bear sitting in the treehouse full of shit?  Was this just a game? A trick played by the toys to fuck with us, tools?  Or was it something more?  I see Sledgehammer, Rake, and Post-hole Digger leaning against the wall in their tangled knot of long-handled lust, but I can't even watch. 

Suddenly, the door opens.  First one muddy boot enters, then another.  Up from the boots sprout two enormous handles, as thick as tree trunks. If only Chainsaw were here.  I think fast, lunging forward, my righteous blade just grazing the beast, and he let out an enormous wail,

"God dammit!"

"What is it?" A voice cried from the distance. 

"It's the damn Sickle, fell down almost took my head off!"  

As I lay on the floor looking up at the beast, I feel his hand grip me.  Was this it?  Had I failed?  But, alas, he leaned me back against the wall, like he knew this dance of ours would not end this day. I dare not try a second lunge. 

As I watched the door close, as he walked away muttering to himself, I knew we had avoided our fate,  or at least delayed it one more day.  While I may not be the protector that the other tools want, I'm the one that they've got. 

I am... the Sharpest Tool in the Shed.
