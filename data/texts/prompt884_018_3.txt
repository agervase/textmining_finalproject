I guessed he was going to use me for his own entertainment, didn't matter at all anyway. I knew he wasn't going to be a challenge nor a problem at all.

&#x200B;

So there was I, sitting in the dark with a rope constraining my hands and feet. The little smirk on his face was clear as if it was in plain sight on a sunny day to me. There we were, the most inexperienced of us thinking he was the crocodile in the room, the other one knowing they were for certain.

&#x200B;

In fact, the 'serial killer' couldn't have known his series were poor and short compared to mine. The days before I heard about his name on the television and couldn't help myself laughing every time. Did people believe he was a real threat? I also didn't think he would've been so careless to kidnap someone he didn't know anything about.

&#x200B;

I knew he thought he could've tortured me before finally killing me. Not thinking about such stupidities and going straight for it would've given me a little more of a challenge, but there we were. In the end, I couldn't resist and burst out laughing.

&#x200B;

"What are you laughing for huh? Didn't you hear about me on the news?" he asked, they were trying to sound annoyed but were very nervous instead. In the end, it's not any day that your victim starts laughing like a maniac knowing full well they're going to die. I guess he didn't even know I could see him with that black darkness. "Oh, of course, I heard about you, with your stupid name and kills count, oh come one, who are you gonna fool?" I answered his question, 'ain't gonna be rude' I told myself. 

&#x200B;

I noticed only then that he was holding a rusty kitchen knife and guessed this was the first time he intended to mangle his victim. 'That's gonna take forever to cut even a single limb' I thought.

&#x200B;

He clutched the knife and answered "With that attitude, I'm happy I chose you to start torturing my victims." with a nervous smirk, but with rage in his voice too. "Oh trust me, you're not gonna manage even getting that thing close to me." I answered annoyed. He held even stronger onto the knife and screamed "IS THAT SO?" as he sprinted towards me. I smirked and, with a strong shake, I made the chair fall on the ground, I knew he didn't fix it on the ground. He tripped on me, falling on the ground and cut his hand.

&#x200B;

Using the scabrous floor to make friction I ripped the rope on my hands and untied my feet too. I got up and took that knife away along with the rope. "I told you, you hadn't any chance. Zip ties would've definitely been better, also rusty knives like this are horrible to cut limbs. You really are an amateur." As he was getting back up I kicked his face, knocking him out and, with a smirk on my face I started getting that job well done.

&#x200B;

In the next days, many wondered why they didn't hear about that guy anymore. On the news they only told he had disappeared to leave nothing behind, I wasn't a show-off like him after all.
