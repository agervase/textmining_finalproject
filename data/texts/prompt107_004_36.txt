"I didn't have a lot to do with the neighbors. We just sort of existed... They had their space and I had mine and that was that. It's not that we didn't know that each other was there because, well, of course we did. The small village had existed for centuries, appearing roughly some 300 years after I found my first resting place, it started as a few huts in the middle of a clearing and steadily grew from there."

"A few times a year I would fly over to see how they were doing (needless to say I did not get a warm welcome, the usual stuff, a few arrows here and there a boulder or two, nothing serious). After a while I lost interest to be honest it didn't look like they were up to much and I wasn't getting anything from my fly overs, sure I still kept tabs on them as they grew but if they didn't bother me then why should I bother them? So over 200 years while they grew from a small village in a forest to a town I kept to myself, feeding when I needed to and sleeping the rest. As time ticked by my dwelling became to small and I had to move, in those times I did check on the human inhabitants out of passing interest, noting the times when they were growing and the times when disaster stuck, fire, flood, plague and the like."

It is worth noting that not all dragons hoard precious items like gold, jewel. There are some that pursue the hoarding of knowledge (these often shape shift to lesser forms to achieve such ends though why they do such a thing is beyond me such forms have their drawbacks and to be perfectly honest should be beneath our kind), others like myself are content to lie and watch the world making use of natural gifts of far-sight and hearing though often we take a little more interest in certain subjects than others much like my village and for these we rouse ourselves from our rest to investigate further as well as avail ourselves of other benefits such movement brings (staying indoors does cramp ones wings after awhile). The other benefit of such watchfulness other than a full centuries rest without interruption by knights or mages and the like is the low cost of moving oneself to new environs.

"It was shortly after one such move, some having just fed myself and found a new cave to rest for a new century of watching the world around me, I noticed that the small town had experienced a long period of growth and had flourished to the point where it was now a city with several outlying towns and with what my far-sight could see had elevated one of their number to rule over them. It was I thought more than a little surprised (amazing how time flies in the blink of a dragons eye) time to fly over them once more and see how my village had progressed. Needless to say while I was expecting my usual welcome, though as it had been some time since I flew over them (preferring to watch from afar as I had done for the past 200 or so years) it was not entirely by surprise that while there were the usual screams of horror and surprise, the arrows were not as forth coming. Noting this I did fly over the central city of this burgeoning and successful kingdom to find them woefully under prepared for my appearance (not that I do anything aside from fly over, dragons that burn cities are sooo uncouth and frankly a boor) after so many years of absence so even more so it does explain what happens next..."

"Hello?, Hello is anyone there?" *cough*, *cough*, "Can you hear me? I need your help!".

The Dragon opened one scaled eye wondering what or who was making that unearthly racket, he had after his fashion just settled down to watch the world and rest for the next one hundred years or so. 

"oh thank god you're still here!" *cough*

His eye lazily searched his cave and settle on the shiny humanoid figure standing in the entrance to his cave, adjusting to the light now pouring through his iris he spoke: "HUMAN YOU HAVE DISTURBED MY REST, WHY HAVE YOU COME, I HAVE NEITHER RICHES NOR KNOWLEDGE FOR YOU TO PLUNDER AND ANY ATTEMPT TO TAKE OF MY BEING WILL BE MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND DEATH ON YOUR PART".

Bending slightly under the pressure of the dragons speech (it is no easy thing to have a dragon speak to you), the weak reply came "O dragon I desire not *cough* riches nor knowledge for in truth I desire none and I *hack* am not long for this world" *cough*

Collapsing under the weight of his armor and now apparent mortal wounds the soldier gestured to the basket on the cave floor now in front of him..

"please.... take her.... she will be safe with you...."

As I gazed upon the basket before me the soldier as I had ascertained him to be breathed, his last and passed from this mortal realm. 

Now my other senses had awoke I smelled fire and within the flame charred timber, stone and flesh and above it all the screams of death and the dying. Fully  rising from my place of rest I took to the sky knowing full well what would meet my gaze, the kingdom I had followed the progress of with some interest over the years, razed to the ground, its riches taken, men and women slain or slaved. I guess such is the way of human life that which I have watched for those long years full of life and love and on the other foot hatred and jealousy such had befallen my neighbors and while sad nothing too upsetting for I assume at least for now nature will either reclaim what remains or the humans will return and rise again..

"As such my tale is finished and I must ask you Andrisdia the spell for taking human form."

"Really? Ovryrth? You of all dragons? Do you not despise such forms?"

Ovryrth smiled a dragon smile as the babe in the basket woke and wailed "Times must I'm afraid".
