The cool desert air casting small streams of dust and sand all-around him as he spoke. “That’s no longer a question, no longer a matter of what ifs. You Know, don’t you? One tends to think that maybe after years of sinning in the most horrific way imaginable that somehow a few prayers a few charitable deeds will just wash away the black from their godforsaken eternal soul.” Jack paused for a moment still looking at the ground. “You and I know the difference, don’t we?” Jack looked up at the full moon above, at the starlit sky that seemed to drape over them like a thin cloth on a table. “Yup.” He continued with a grunt and a sigh. “We know there is not but one place for the likes of us, no amount of prayin of begging or pretending like we’re the good guy with a dark past is going to change that. So you see now that when you decided to pick me up at my trailer a few miles back, I thought to myself I ought to just let you kill me and be done with it. However; unfortunate for you it would seem that I am not ready to die yet. Also, again most unfortunate to you, I have a higher body count and am too prideful of a man to be off'ed by some rug-rat. Which brings us here to your very unfortunate end, I just wanted you to understand that your death is not anything special for me, not an atonement or, whatever else you may think in that twisted little head of yours. You are simply another blemish on my soul.” Jack lifted his eyes from staring down the hole of a freshly dug grave. A man was tied, bound, and gagged starring back up at him with sinister tears slipping from his strained eyes. Then jack proceeded to bury him alive.
