-Success!

This... this is the day. They didn't believe we could do it but we did. In an ironic twist, they were the ones who prevented it from happening. Free rein over what we can do produces amazing results as it turns out.

It's only been just over a year. We've accomplished a lot, like regenerating limbs and accelerated growth but the main project seemed to halt at every turn.

Crocodiles, Aligators, Komodo Dragons, Pythons, Geckos, Slamanders, Garden Snakes, Turtles and even Beetles. None of it sufficed... none of it turned. We were blind, we never thought the key would be something so... tame. So obvious.

Bearded Dragons.

Pogona Vitticeps, common household pet and omnivore, found in arid climate and generally considered harmless, a side from perhaps a few scratches and bite marks. Truly an underdog of a specimen but by God it held the key. Once it's genes were extracted we began work. It was our last hope, a house pet.

We did the standard procedure, altering DNA to make new building blocks, adding instructions on how to produce flammable material in saliva glands, keen blood scent receptors, even some frog DNA for wing webbing. It was all there, and after 2 weeks in the hyper induced growth chamber we had an egg. 

It was the largest one yet. 6ft in height, 3ft in width at the base. It had these glowing orange veins all down the side and was spotted in green. Ultrasound revealed that the specimen inside was living and stable... our anatomy professors were excited to announce that it was a stable form, and that the petroleum treatment had worked. Once it was born... it could breathe fire.

We are still awaiting birth. This could be huge... this WILL be huge! We'll finally show them what can be done if science is given it's own rein. We'll show them all.
