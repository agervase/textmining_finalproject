I hit the random button again, then leaned forward in my chair down in the dim basement.

*That* sub.

It had started as a joke, really; every candidate for president got one. Mine had originally been just full of links to my YouTube videos and memes about how some dumb guy on Reddit was *totally* going to become president.  And how better to parody the most infamous political sub than to go with r/The_Dragon?

Of course, some people thought it would be funny to help me, and so I'd started getting PMs "volunteering" for my campaign. No regular Redditor had ever run for president before, and, well, if spamming r/politics had worked for the Russians, why not for me?

Of course, everyone had forgotten just how dumb the press was. It only took a few playful botnets upvoting the few articles on me to the top of r/politics and r/news for the news to start picking up on me as a quirky news story, resulting in a cycle of the press reporting on my "internet popularity", resulting in more stories to get upvoted, resulting in even more "popularity".

People forget how many people are on Reddit, and it only takes a few to get you to a couple percentage points in the polls and make it on the debate stage, especially when there's a clear frontrunner in the election.

But the Internet is a funny thing. Amidst all the trolling and memeing and rare pepes (a vain attempt to reclaim them from r/the_donald), a few people genuinely wanted to help.

In *Fight Club*, the protagonists little army had said that they cooked your food and cleaned your house, so you couldn't screw with them. Of course, that was just a movie - but in real life, the Internet wasn't so different. Except instead of cooking your food and cleaning your house, the nerds on Reddit run your email servers and set up your VOIP lines.

And it only takes one of those to not like their boss, to not want the person who hired them to be the next president of the United States, to give you everything you need to, in the first debate, seem like the God of the Internet, the man who sees all the hidden strings that have been tied to the candidates.

Funny how seeming like you know what you're doing can boost you to the top of the polls.

Back during the campaign, I'd checked the sub several times a day. When the "TD hates everything" meme from back in my fanfiction review days took off, I made sure to make a few scrunchy faces to the press over the next few days that would be suitable for remixing. When they talked about the strings that controlled the system, I managed to get a picture of myself with my hands held up like I was dangling a puppet on strings on the front page of the Washington Post. Memes may seem like a dumb way to keep popular and relevant, but with a bunch of people constantly trying to get dumb meme posts to the top of every thread about me, it made it impossible for all the Russian shills to get their posts seen. The front page of r/politics became choked with articles with high memetic value, as everyone and their brother wanted to be the one to post about the dumb Reddit guy who thought he could beat Trump.

And so the news, endlessly obsessed with copying cheap trivia from the Internet, spent all their time about me reporting about dumb memes, while the President burned and twisted under scrutiny from all sides.

I stopped really checking the sub after I became president. Sure, every once in a while I looked again, just to see the latest meme and maybe help someone out a bit (and sometimes get some cheap karma by posting pictures of myself on the sub anonymously - something that r/karmaconspiracy began catching onto, though they thought it was just one of my staff).

But over time, as stuff got increasingly serious, I'd just sort of stopped - yeah, it was kind of funny, but it was also a bit freaky, and it was beginning to feel a bit like a cult of personality.

Still, couldn't hurt to post there today.

I moved my mouse over and clicked on Submit a New Post About Our Glorious Dragon Overlord.

> **I'm the President of the United States! AMA!**

> Hey guys! TD here, as you can see from my totally spiffy flair. I know I don't come in here much anymore, but I just thought I'd touch bases with you guys after tonight. I love all the support you guys have given me, especially given recent events, and I thought I'd answer any questions you folks had about anything that's going on right now.

I hit the submit button, and waited.

Usually, it didn't take long for threads like this to get a response.

I glanced down at the clock in the corner of my screen. 12:52. Sighing, I clicked back to the main page of the sub, then clicked on "new". There my post was, still with one upvote. I glanced down at the corner of the screen and waited. 12:53. 12:54. I hit refresh again.

Still one vote.

I reached up to rub my hand through my hair before moving down to the next few posts.

> **Where is he?**

> **What does undisclosed location mean?**

300,000 upvotes. I clicked on the thread, then clicked to sort by new.

The last post was four hours ago.

I glanced down towards the clock in the corner of my screen. 1:02.

Someone would reply to my thread soon, right?
