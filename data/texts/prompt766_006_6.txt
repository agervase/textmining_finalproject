"Installation complete?" I whisper to my self. What could have been installing all this time? A few days later i would remember... 

I woke up and prepared for school like any other day, i got dressed had breakfast and started on my journey. About half way there I see Tim, my best friend. He always had my back.

Stepping towards me he casually asked "Hey whats up my dude?" 

I replied "Not much how about you?"

He replied to my reply? "Nah nothing much... I did get this cool toy from the shop yesterday!"

He pulled a small item from out of his school bag, three plastic appendages and a metal nucleus. I knew what this item was, and it instantly reminded me of what I had been installing for the last two years. And then I realized: I HAVE TO GET HOME.

I made a break towards my house. Tim shouted somthing, probably asking me where I was going. I didn't have time to say. I needed to get home! I ran as fast as I can. It felt like an eternity before i reached my house. I opened the front door and ran up the stairs to my room. I turned on my computer, and logged in. There it was,  game that I had purchased all those years ago. Fidget Spinner Simulator, the closest thing to true art, it perfectly encapsulated the current human condition. I started the download and installation without realising it would take this long... Like it doesn't actualy make sense at all really, maby I was right about my computer being slow, that would explain why the installation took this long...

(Thanks for reading to this point... Unless you didn't. For better or for worse i don't write stuff normally so smash that like button?)
