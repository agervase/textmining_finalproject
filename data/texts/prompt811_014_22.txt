"Szalarial, Lord of Bones, Collector, King of Misfortune, I call on you. Szalarial, Emperor of the Forsaken, I invoke your name. Szalarial, the Great Calamity, in the name of the Wandering King I offer a pact." The young boy dragged the ceremonial dagger across his palm, squeezing precious crimson into the chalice before him. Szalarial became aware of the ceremony the moment his name was uttered. From his throne in the Abyss, he listened to the chant repeat. He heard the dagger scrape flesh, catch, and slide through wet, hot, blood. With mild interest, Szalarial noted that none had invoked his final and most terrible title in nearly sixty years. Not since...

The child had offered his pact in the name of the Wandering King. Had he no shame? No decency remaining? Szalarial's eyes snapped open as he rose from his throne and allowed the ritual to draw him in. He felt the tremors in the air surrounding him as his vision swirled and the majesty of his chambers was erased. He found himself standing - towering, really - over a boy no older than seven turns of the Great Wheel. They stood in a wood and dirt cellar filled with broken pottery, spoiling produce, and countless empty bottles. A single candle lit the small room from its resting place at the makeshift altar the boy had erected. Before the child had time to notice him, Szalarial willed his form to shift to that of a human.

&#x200B;

The change was instant, but for Szalarial, he felt every part of him knotting, shifting, and reshaping. His six fiery eyes fused into two, changing at the same time to a dull silver glow as his goat-like pupils compressed and rounded. His wings folded inward upon themselves dozens of times until they rested tightly against his shoulders before dissolving into his body. As they shrank, he noticed with disdain as his preternatural sense of the surrounding area faded. Without his wings he could no longer sense the movement of air as keenly. He could no longer detect any would be attackers. Or prey. No matter. The ritual had been completed and first lines of the contract were already forming in the air around him and the boy. Nothing could have interrupted these proceedings even if they so desired. Finally, he saw the room grow before him as his perspective shifted lower to the ground. His true form's nine foot long body shriveled to a mere six. He drew in a breath.

&#x200B;

"I am Szalarial. Master of Below, Champion of Torment, Keeper of the Secret Lie, and all the titles you have given me before," he boomed. The wooden supports creaked at the sound of his voice and dirt was shaken loose from the hard-packed walls. "My titles, like my power, are countless. You may call me Lord Szalarial."

&#x200B;

The child's eyes rose from the bowl upward to meet Szalarial's before quickly returning to the ground. He prostrated himself before Szalarial. "Great Lord Szalarial. In the name of the Wandering King I-"

&#x200B;

"Yes, yes. You offer a pact." Szalarial consciously lowered his voice, lest he bring the roof down on top of his would-be acolyte. "I can see his influence from merely looking at you. The Wandering King has offered you this ritual. I wonder. Did he extract a price for this knowledge or offer it freely?" Szalarial turned his left hand, palm facing upward, and lifted it in the air, bidding the boy to rise.

&#x200B;

"It was freely given, Lord." The boy rose and looked Szalarial in the eyes.  "He said that all I owed to him was paid in the summoning and that all I owe to you will be paid in the proceedings. Begging your pardon, Great Lord Szalarial, but what are proceedings?" The boy did not tremble with fear. He did not avert his gaze. He did not understand, then. He did not understand the terrible cost. But, the ritual had been completed. The contract weighed heavily on them both and could not simply be dissolved.

&#x200B;

"Our conversation, boy. This conversation will be the pro-"

&#x200B;

"Eos," he interrupted. He *interrupted!* "My name is Eos, Lord Szalarial."
