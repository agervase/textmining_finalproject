"Michael!" I shouted, as cold, thick hands held me down to the bed. "Michael!"

"He's gone, Jovan," said the woman beside the bed. The man holding me down let me go after I stopped struggling. A dull throbbing took over my bandaged arms, and my heavy head pulled me down to the pillow. 

"You couldn't save him, Jovan" said the man, his voice gruff. He looked out the window, his one eye covered with a patch. A heavy blizzard was thrashing against the wooden cabin we were in, a heavy, grey blizzard. 

"Where am I?" I asked the woman. "Who are you? Who is Michael?" 

The woman shook her head, red curls bouncing from side to side. Her golden eyes were glossy as they regarded as one would a puppy with a broken leg. 

"All those memories," said the man. "And nothing came of it." 

"Where is your sensitivity, Myran?" asked the woman, frowning. 

"Would someone please give me answers?" 

Myran sighed. "You gave up all of your memories to save your child. It didn't work." 

"My memories?" 

"Yes," said the woman. "I'm Lysa. You're Jovan. And you tried to save your son, Michael, from the Crusaders." 

I felt my stomach drop. I didn't know what they were talking about. But I knew they weren't lying when they said Michael was my son. I felt drawn to his name. The mere mention of him tugged on mind, but trying to remember him was like scratching a phantom limb. 

"How did he die?" I asked, swallowing a lump. 

"The Crusaders shot him down near the Bloody Cauldron," said Myran. "I told him i  wasn't safe there. I told him, Lysa! And I told you, Jovan!"

Myran leaned towards me, his fists clenched tight, and face twisted in a scowl. 

"Hey!" Lysa shouted. "You don't get to say that. You didn't give up all your memories to save him!" 

Myran turned to the window. "It's only a matter of time before they come for us." 

"Who are the Crusaders?" 

"They are the King's watch-dogs," Lysa said. "When the world found out we could cast spells by giving up memories, King Alynn ordered a witch-hunt. Michael was our strongest caster." 

"And now's he gone," I said. No matter how much they told me, it was like I was trying to put back a picture ripped to a thousand pieces. And Michael was the only piece I could understand. 

Thunder crashed in the distance. And then again, but closer. The door to the cabin erupted, and a giant man in steel armor stepped through. He held a large hammer with both hands and swung for Lysa. 

Lysa cried out a word before the hammer crushed her skull. In a flash of light, Myran and I were lying in the snow, the bitter cold numbing me instantly. 

"Bastards," shouted Myran, pulling me up. My legs were too weak and I fell back on the snow. More men in steel rushed for us, this time holding small cannons on their shoulders. 

Green burst from the cannons, rushing through the blizzard easily, but Myran deflected them with only a few words. 

"You may kill me," said Myran. "But you won't kill me with my memories!" 

Two more words he shouted, and burst into light. And light was I could see until the darkness took me. 

I woke up with a cry, my arms were ripped from my body and my red blood pooled over the grey snow. The blizzard had stopped, revealing a dark blue sky. The world was silent save for the sound of metal falling on the snow. 

As my vision faded and pain took over my consciousness,  I could see the face of a blond boy with dark red eyes smiling at me. 

"Michael."
