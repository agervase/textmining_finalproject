At first Aegir was appalled at the mortal's hubris in challenging the gods.  As the night went on, his disdain moved slowly into curiosity and then finally burgeoned into respect.  As their mugs magically filled themselves again, more times than anyone could even count anymore, Aegir clapped the man on the back and walked him over to another nearby table.  Seated at this new table was a group of four men.  As Aegir and the mortal approached, the obvious leader sporting his own massive tankard of mead, an even larger hammer laying on the table next to him, turned to regard them. 

"Tell Thor what you told me," Aegir said to the man.  The man looked around the table, from the leader to each of the other three warriors.  Suddenly, he ripped the shirt from his chest and grabbed two of the tankards off of the table and chugged them down, one after the other.  Then, wiping the foam from his beard he looked Thor straight in the eye and yelled, "I am the MACHINE!"

Thor and all but one of the warriors burst into laughter. The drinks flowed once more and as the hours passed, the gods showed no sign of stopping. The man known as The Machine kept pace with them, drink for drink.  Eventually, the third warrior could keep his peace no longer.

"It is disgraceful to have this mortal sitting and drinking at a table meant only for the gods!" He shouted as he stood, "I will have no part in it.  We will see what Odin has to say about this 'Machine'."  With that, he turned to leave, but before he could make it to the door, his head was caved in by a massive hammer and his body crumpled to the floor.  Thor stood from the table and walked over to retrieve his weapon.  

As he wiped the blood from the head of his mighty war-hammer he looked The Machine in the eye and said, "Fuck that bitch. This is Asgard."
