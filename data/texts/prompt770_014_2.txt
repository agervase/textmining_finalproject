'What do you *mean* what's the deal with the penguin'

&nbsp;

'I mean, what's the DEAL with the PENGUIN.  


&nbsp;

'There's a 6 foot tall penguin waddling along behind you.


&nbsp;

'That's not normal.


&nbsp;

'What's the deal with it?'


&nbsp;

I paused.


&nbsp;

'Wait... You're serious right now?'


&nbsp;

'Of *course* I'm serious, why else would I ask you?'


&nbsp;

'I mean... nobody else *has* ever asked me, that's the thing.


&nbsp;

'I've been to therapy, I've talked to counselors... hell... I just... don't even *mention* it anymore.  Just kind of go along with it.


&nbsp;

'Wait... what?'


&nbsp;

I shook my head.


&nbsp;

'I've had this thing where I've seen this giant ass penguin my whole fucking life.  And do you know who believes me?  Nobody.


&nbsp;

'That's who.


&nbsp;

'Nobody.


&nbsp;

'Nobody fucking believes me.  


&nbsp;

'Just... "there's obviously not a penguin here...  We should probably look into upping your medication."


&nbsp;

'So I don't say anything anymore.


&nbsp;

'I learned that a long time ago.


&nbsp;

'Don't say anything, don't make a big deal out of it,' I shrugged.  'After a certain point in time they stop believing that you *do* see something.


&nbsp;

'You don't bring it up?  Everyone starts to forget about it .


&nbsp;

'But not me.


&nbsp;

'I've had this little fucker beside me for God only knows how long,' I shook my head.  'Can't get rid of him, can't seem to figure him the hell out either.


&nbsp;

'Just a fucking *penguin* of *all* things, Following me the hell around.


&nbsp;

'Hell...  I would have thought he'd be *dead* by now but: nope.  Still here.


&nbsp;

'Still an ever-present and constant annoyance that nobody else can...


&nbsp;

'Wait...


&nbsp;

'...Fuck me... you can *see* him...


&nbsp;

'...holy shit...'  I blinked at her in astonishment.


&nbsp;

'...you can *see* him?


&nbsp;

She nodded.


&nbsp;

'I can,' she said, looking at my ever-present and nigh invisible companion for a long, thoughtful moment before looking back at me.


&nbsp;

'He,' she said.  'He has something to say...'


&nbsp;

She paused.


&nbsp;

'It's about to begin...


&nbsp;

'...we should get ready...'
