Alex moved to the city to become an architectural engineer. He was certainly capable of learning everything he would need on his own, but he needed the an official degree and a license to get the jobs he wanted. Alex’s dream was to design his own city.

On his first day in the city, he bought a plot of land five miles from campus with money he had saved up from collecting recyclables every day. He cut down the trees on it and made himself a rough log cabin in a few hours. Classes didn’t start for a week.  By the time they did, he was living in a two-story wooden house with plumbing and electricity hooked up.

Every day at five A.M., Alex woke up, made a three-course breakfast for himself, and then ran to campus. He missed taking care of the farm animals like home, but he supposed sacrifices had to be made.

His classes were populated by novices. They were bright, smiling schoolchildren, with not an ounce of sweat or muscle between them. They disgusted him, but he did his best to smile through it.

Each class was a mixture of practical and theoretical exercises. 

He studied theory night and day, sleeping in the library, only to wake up, run five miles home for breakfast, and run back in time for class. Everything was a struggle, as it had been his whole life, and he pushed through the pain. There was no other way. He had a far better grasp of the principles than anyone in the class.

For the practical exercises, he was assigned to a team with three other students. Jack, Melissa, and Barb all gave their names when they were paired up. He shook their limp hands and introduced himself only as their better. And he proved it.

For each exercise, his three teammates were left on the sidelines as his mighty efforts yielded top-of-the-line projects. A pinball machine with anti-magnetic paddles to propel the ball. A crystal fountain that could be switched into fire hydrant mode in an emergency. A stadium made from popsicle sticks that could survive being hit by a car.

But as the year went on, he struggled to keep up. Each competition was one against four, and the other teams had their own wonderful creations. The last straw was when his stadium lost a competition to another group that made self-cleaning sink/baking soda volcano that was a shout out to their favorite professor’s favorite science fair project. 

Why should he care what their professor liked? What was the point of something that cleaned itself? You were only missing out on a few hours scrubbing. That was nothing to Alex. 

He added an upper level chemistry course to his workload in the middle of term, assuring his class advisor that he could handle it. There was no way he was going to miss the chance to add chemical reactions to his project, now that the novices had given him the idea. But the lessons he joined built on weeks of knowledge he didn’t have. He had struggled for his whole life. For the first time he was reaching his limits.

Alex was laying on his workshop floor, staring at the ceiling, when Barb came by. 

“Jack thought you might want a little help.” She showed him a sketch of a Rube Goldberg machine, totally different from the cannon he was working on.

Alex’s head was dizzy from fumes of the chemicals he had been mixing. If he had been in his right mind, he would have shouted down her questioning of his abilities. Instead he weakly nodded, and immediately left the lab.

“Mom?” Alex paced back and forth, phone to his ear. He didn’t like feeling unable to keep up. His parents had always pushed him, and he knew that he could count on them to do it again. He would get stronger, strong enough to do everything alone.

After he explained the situation, and his moment of weakness in allowing the girl to help him, his mother was silent for a long moment.

“Your father had a brother growing up.” Alex frowned, wondering why he had never heard about an uncle. 

“He lived on the expert difficulty, like you chose to.”

“Can I talk to him? I mean, it’s not like I need help. But if I know what he did, I can learn to do it too.”

“No, you can’t. He died when you were very small.”

“He died?? How?” It was a ridiculous thought. Novice doctors faced the same level of challenge as someone playing Operation.

“He insisted on performing his own surgery, without anesthesia. He passed out while stitching himself up and bled to death. If he had had anyone assisting him, they would have been able to call for help. We never even found out he was injured until we got the call that he had died.”

Alex didn’t know what to say. The brief thought passed his mind that maybe his uncle just hadn’t been good enough for expert level. The pain in his mother’s voice prevented him from voicing that thought, however.

“Listen, your father and I had reservations when you chose expert level. It can push you to become stronger, but it also isolates you. Cooperation is another kind of strength.”

“I’ll think about it.”

“No, you’ll try it. We’ve never forced the issue before, but we can change the setting for you. Try out Novice level until the end of the semester, and if you want to go back to Expert after that, we’ll let you.”

“Mom!”

“I have to go, honey. I love you.” She hung up.

Alex the Novice joined his classmates in presenting a Rube Goldberg machine, with the first piece launched by a rocket, in the next competition. They won. 

He looked at the smiles on his teammates’ faces and felt his Expert reserve crack. This wasn’t so bad. Not bad at all.
