&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked. I glanced at Tim. Tim looked back at me, confusion sprawled across his face, his jaw slightly slack, his mouth slightly open. “Tim, Mom. Tim,” I said, putting my hand on her knee. Her brow furrowed in confusion, and she repeated her question. I sighed and shook my head. Tim put his face in his hands and sighed louder. “Mom, it’s me. Tim. Belle’s twin? Your youngest son? I did your taxes last year, I gave you rides when your license was revoked, and...I’m your son.” 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother said nothing. She hadn’t opened her eyes since she’d been diagnosed with glaucoma, since she’d learned it was far too late to do anything about it. I guess alzheimer’s hadn’t taken away that particular nervous tic. I patted Tim’s back and gave him a sympathetic look before turning back to my mother. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mom, you remember me, right? Belle?” her frown deepened, “Of course I remember you. What kind of mother would I be if I forgot the name of one of my God given children? I’m insulted you even suggested it!” She sniffed loudly and turned away from us. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave up. “...Ookay Mom. We’re gonna go. We’ll come by again tomorrow, okay?” I patted her knee again, turned to the nurse, nodded to her, and left the hospital room. “I didn’t think she’d gotten that bad,” Tim said, his eyes distant, “I thought we’d have a little more time. I thought she’d at least remember us long enough for us to graduate.” I grimaced towards him. I hadn’t been quite as optimistic as he, our mother had been...older when she’d adopted us. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I’m driving,” I said, reaching in his pocket for the keys, “you don’t look great, and I don’t want you stress driving.” He rolled his eyes, but let me take the keys anyway. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll call Sybil and give her an update, she’ll pass it on,” I said, dialing my older sister’s number. Our conversation was brief. I said something about our mother forgetting her child, told her I loved her, and hung up. As we walked to the parking lot, my pace slowed. Instead of the battered car we’d shared since freshman year of high school, instead of any sort of parking space, sat a single-ride bike fasted to a single bike rack. I slowed to a halt and my brother walked past me, as if nothing was out of the ordinary. His hand reached to where a passenger door would have been, appeared to mime opening a door, and...vanished.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped. I blinked. I walked forward, felt around, and found a soft surface. “Tim? Tim, are you there? Where are you?!” I blurted, feeling around the invisible something. His muffled voice said something, I’m not sure what. The something got softer and softer. Then it just wasn’t. I felt around more, hoping that the something my brother had just dissapeared into was separate from the something I had been feeling around, but either it was or it was just too late. Tim was gone. I dropped to my knees, and my phone vibrated. I silently answered the phone. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Belle, I’m going to visit Mom. Do you know what room she’ll be in?” I said nothing, still in shock. “Belle?” I found my voice - “Sybil, Tim’s gone. I don’t know what’s happening. Tim’s gone.” Tears ran down my face, and I was about to say more, before she interrupted me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who?”

Critiques wanted. Lots. Critique meeee.
