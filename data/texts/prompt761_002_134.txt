Skin is cold. Eyes are dry. {Wake up}. It is 3am but my body is throbbing with energy.  {Sit up}. I can see more words, but they are blurry, so I put on my glasses. Good. Sight restored. 

{Get to safety}. 

"Oh fuck." 
I sift through carefully catalogued memories of the past 24 hours, and make sure to monitor the stimuli that had logged into my body while my mind was absent in sleep. 

My consciousness tells me I am safe. 

My hard drive tells me I am not alone in the house. 

Its not that I trust my hard drive more than my consciousness- I simply know better than to fight it. It is impossible. It is law in my body. 

There is a sound from my ceiling. My consciousness tells me it is a rat or a possum or the groan of aged wood. My hard drive tells me to {run}. 

I run. 

I do not know where I am going. Bile rises in my throat and my head thickens with panic. {Escape}. I realise that my feet are bare and I realise I am still in my nightclothes and then I realise it doesn't matter because I just need to {escape}. My arms are heavy and my legs burn and I want to scream with the pain of it all but fear overpowers weakness. {Escape}. 
Footsteps behind me. Footsteps next to me. My consciousness is sick and oozing and it begs me to turn and look, but my hard drive screams into my head and my bones that running is the only way to {escape}. 

The footsteps are getting louder, but another noise begins to take hold. Metal grating and screaming and the feeling of nails on chalkboards and the squeal of a pig being gutted alive and of children being crushed beneath buildings. The pain in my ears is almost unbearable. I hear myself screaming along. My consciousness begs me to turn around. It kneels with bloodied hands and claws at my brain stem and begs and begs and begs. My hard drive slaughters it without mercy. 

{Escape} I {Escape} run {Escape} and {Escape} run {Escape} and {Escape} run. 

My legs {Escape} feel raw {Escape} and my feet {Escape} burn on the {Escape} asphalt and are sticky {Escape} with blood. My hands {Escape} have started {Escape} to peel {Escape} skin off my {Escape} face and rip out {Escape} fleshy chunks of {Escape} hair. 

Go, the hard drive tells me, go go go go go and do not stop.

I do not stop. 

I do not notice the truck. 

I notice the pain. I notice my sternum, and my ribs, and my femur and my ulna. I notice the cruel way they push through my skin, ripping it fully and escaping into the air with a wet pop and crack. 

The hard drive is silent. Everything is silent. There is no noise except for the gurgle of blood in my throat, and the sharp clicking of my exposed bones in the heavy wind. 

Vision impaired. Beginning to fade. 

{Complete}.

"Reports have emerged from across the country of mass suicides supposedly caused by technopsychotic software implants. Witnesses report the victims showed intense paranoia and were certain they were under attack from non-existent forms and suffered from intense auditory and visual hallucinations. All bearers of a technopsychotic implant are to be taken to authorities for isolation or euthanisation."
