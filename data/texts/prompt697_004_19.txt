I had recently created my character in the online video game everyone enjoys so much. Everything was normal at first and I began grinding quests and leveling up. I noticed something move amongst the dense fog (I have a slow computer so I have to play with a tiny render distance). I thought it was a cow, so I perused them, hoping to grab some hide for armor.

It wasn't a cow though. Looking back at me was another character with the default skin, but his eyes were empty. I saw no name pop up. He didn't stay long, he looked at me and quickly ran into the fog. I pursued out of curiosity, but he was gone.

I logged out and went on the forums to see if anyone else had found this pseudo-player. There were none. I created my own topic telling of the man and asking if anyone had a similar experience. The post was deleted within five minutes. I tried again, and the topic was deleted even faster. I received a PM from an account with no name containing one word: 'Stop.' When I went to look at his profile, the page 404'd.

I received an email from another user. He claimed the mods could see other users messages, so it was safer using email. The emailer claimed that he had seen the mystery player too, and had a small 'directory' of other users who had seen him as well. Their all described their mystery player to have no pupils.

About a month passed before I heard from my informer again. Some of the players who have encountered this mysterious man have looked into it. After some further information gathering, it was revealed to be a user who died in his VR pod, his soul trapped in the game.

I have had no other encounters with this "digital phantom", but users have been regularly reporting his presence on the forums, and my informer soon informing them.

If anyone knows the huge reference I have in that writing prompt, points for you. I decided to write this from the point of view of a player because I was reminded of an old myth I think some of you can find.
