&nbsp;

We miss you already vesci is doing great

&nbsp;

Since you're away we've ordered some lisk rolls and I'm letting her throw a sleepover with all her friends

&nbsp;

They’re playing games right now

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Cuuin, leizty,  the twins miz and mioz, and jennifer

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sorry I couldn't think of a reason not to let vesci invite her

&nbsp;

She did the thing where she makes her cheeks go all poofy and adorable ::3 it's impossible to say no to that face

&nbsp;

It's alright I'm watching them 

&nbsp;

They're playing games right now there's nothing to worry about

&nbsp;

>&nbsp;

>What are they playing?

>&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They're playing a hiding game 

&nbsp;

They turn off all the lights run away while jennifer tries to find them by sensing their air vibrations or something

&nbsp;

I know it sounds creepy but it's just a game it's harmless

&nbsp;

Your overreacting I'm watching them

&nbsp;

Nothing like that is going to happen

&nbsp;

Sorry

&nbsp;

I'll turn them on again if anybody sends a signal to be actually scared and not just playing scared

&nbsp;

I know I understand how you feel

&nbsp;

The way they lock on to you and follow you around. Makes me feel like I should be guarding my neck.

&nbsp;

Okay that's a little xenophobic ::P

&nbsp;

Someone, Sweety

&nbsp;

not something

&nbsp;

If it makes you feel better I can ask Jennifer to bring her parents over sometime and we can meet them

&nbsp;

We'll signal with them about about customs and what we do to keep ourselves safe so there's no misunderstandings and nobody gets confused.
