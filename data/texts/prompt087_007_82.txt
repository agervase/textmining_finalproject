It became easier and easier for me. I expected the opposite. 

Nevertheless, I found gates unlocked, dogs chained up, and even alarm systems neglectfully nonworking. The city had let its guard down for whatever fortunate reason, and burglary became my full time job.

I was humble at first, but with the sheer number of houses I'd hit with not an iota of suspicion having arisen, it was tough not to laud myself as something of a mastermind; up in the ranks with the likes of Al Capone and Jesse James. 

I stole just below a noticeable loot each time, and covered my tracks down to the last speck of foreign dust. As a matter of fact, I usually left the house in much better shape than I invaded it in.

This was the key I think. People mistook robbery for charity. The city was in revelry. Crime was reported at record lows. Haven seekers inundated the city. Newspapers wrote of a mysterious public servant. Citizens misunderstood it as a pro bono initiative and they lent themselves to this non-existent cause. Streets were cleaned and programs and charities started. Everyone pitched in to make the city a better place. 

They thought me their beacon of kindness and progress. In reality I was the city's greatest criminal. 

I played along with the charitable movement, and even set myself apart in 'good works' to ever ease suspicion of future thievery. I opened an orphanage. I joined PACs, I aided in catching other criminals, and now I find myself behind the mayor's desk after all these years of getting away with robbery.

The fools. If only they knew their mayor was a low-down scheming malefactor. They've made it too easy. I don't even need to steal anymore. As long as this city remains a safe, happy haven of peace and justice, they're all putty in my hands.
