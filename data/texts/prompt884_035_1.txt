He awoke to pain from forming bruises on his torso and the scabbing lashes left by a whip. Consciousness brought the vague recognition of being on his knees on a stone floor, wrists bound too tightly above his head. He couldn't feel his hands, the entirety of his body weight had caused the ropes to dig into his flesh as he hung limp from the ceiling. The sound of footsteps, then a yell, followed by more footsteps. The dungeon cell became warmer as several bodies entered.

The lead zealot spoke in butchered elvish, from holy books that the elves had never had a hand in. He became aware of a tightness on his face. No doubt flaking paint from runes drawn there. None of this was the focus of his thoughts, however.

What had chased him through the shadows? He had never been seen on that plane by anything that existed there. He stayed to the edges, to the pockets that let him slip between. Never disturbing anything and always quiet. He had felt it as soon as he passed through, something far more powerful than he was in the shadow, and his exit had vanished in that moment of realization. There had been no choice but to travel through the plane to find another. He practically fell out of the next one he found, landing on his face, drained from panic and the exertion of travelling so far in the dark. He hadn't had the luxury of being discreet, and so he ended up in a busy marketplace, the sun just setting, in one of the most religious cities in the kingdom.

The man grew louder, condemning him as tainted by the magic he wielded and blaming him for the creatures that continued to become more common across the land. They'd kill him to appease the elves they worshiped. The elves that didn't care about their useless human lives. The elves that were just as afraid of magic as they were, and couldn't save them if they had even an ounce of the needed compassion to do so.

It was a struggle, but he lifted his head and opened his eyes. The men and women around him were blurs he didn't care to focus on, despite the loudest of them wielding a knife that was likely meant to gut him. He was searching for the green glow of eyes he knew were more than anxious to get started. He found them in a dark corner, the flicker of candles hinting at a silhouette that no one else had the sense to notice. As if it had been waiting on him to wake, there came the wet sound of a blade passing slowly through the holy man in front of him. Familiar screaming started setting off fear and confusion throughout the group. He imagined that one by one their throats were slit by invisible blades, or their hearts suddenly felt a crushing pressure, but his chin came to rest on his chest, lacking the energy to watch the show unfold.

'We should play with the elf worshipers more often.' That voice in his head was always far too cheerful for his liking. He could feel its' aura grinning with sadistic glee. 'So many dead children and peasants on their hands, the level of terror in dealing with real magic was exquisite.'

&#x200B;

His restraints loosened, letting him fall heavily into the forming pool of blood. The warmth of its energy running through him was everything he could have asked for in that moment. Drawn into the sensation of fleeing life finding its way into his cold body, he heard the voice once more before leaving the waking world again.

&#x200B;

'A pity they didn't know how truly insignificant their body count was,' It was laced with disappointment. 'So they could have been far, far more afraid in their final moments.'
