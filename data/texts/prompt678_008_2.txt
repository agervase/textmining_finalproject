I thought to myself, "How can I keep this relationship going without telling her that I work for the NSA? And tell her that I'm watching her through her webcam right now? What will she say to me? Will she be mad at me, or will she forgive me and keep loving me? Will she treat me differently if I tell her? I don't know. I don't know if it is even worth telling her my true profession. I don't know if it is for the better for the both of us in the long run to end this relationship for the sake of my job. This is my job. Is it worth risking this relationship for the sake of my job? I really do love her though. She's one of the best people I've ever met in my life. Maybe I should tell her. I don't know if I want to."

I watch Skylar climb into her bed. I don't know why am I doing this to her? Gosh, I'm such a horrible boyfriend. Is it right for her to know this? Why did my boss have to assign me to watch her of all people tonight?

Skylar grabs her phone on her nightstand and begins to start typing. Soon, my phone vibrates a second later. I look at it to see what it says.

"goodnight sweetie! hope you're having a good day at work. :)"

My heart sank as I saw this text message.

"Goodnight, Skylar." I replied.

I sighed I sent it. I know she doesn't know I'm watching her right now. This isn't right. Each moment I do this, it feels like a part of me is whithering away.

I watch Skylar pull herself under the covers and turn off the lights. The screen then goes completely black.

I close my laptop out of shame.

I think I much rather deal with the consequences from my boss later...
