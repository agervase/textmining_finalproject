Frantic.

Disorientate.

Nauseating.

&#x200B;

It felt even more nauseous then entering a normal feed, her head whipping to and fro, relentlessly running down an undivided grey causeway.

&#x200B;

Her hands and arms were shaking.

Tears blurring her vision as she staggered onward.

Smoke filled the ceiling.

An eerie red glow stains the walls.

A continual shaking, not just from her, but from the floor, as though the building was shivering.

&#x200B;

She ran on.

&#x200B;

It was a stampede with nowhere to go.

People shouting, screaming and crying.

Some grasping a holy book, praying to their gods for mercy.

Others slumped over on the floor, losing all will.

Still others clinging to their cellphones, hoping to connect to their family for a last word.

&#x200B;

She passed them all.

&#x200B;

The corridor was an eternity, a haze of grey and red with only a bright white light at the end. *\[It dawns on me. But she could not hear what I have to say.\]*

Like in slow motion, she sees others, who were faster then her, already exiting from there.

It felt like forever, but she reached the opening in less then a minute. *\[I begged. At least, at least wait hold on for just a minute. Just a minute. But she could not hear.\]*

It last ages, when she catapulted herself outside, into the open sky, a bright blue sky as if there was not a worry in the world.

It gave way to a wall of grey and black as her vision tilted along with her body.

&#x200B;

She was no longer quivering.

Her tears rushed out of her eyes.

Like a strange stillness, all that could be seen was that wall of grey and black inching closer and closer. *\[I screamed, I begged for her to close her eyes... Futile, for she could not hear me.\]*

The time only seemed to go slower and slower, further and further...

...

...

It was just a mere 8 seconds.

&#x200B;

For some to witness their soulmate's death.

It's an inevitability.

&#x200B;

For some to die witnessing their soulmate's death.

It's just a statistic.
