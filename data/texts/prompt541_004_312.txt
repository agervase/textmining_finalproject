I still remember the first night.

We couldn't go outside, make a noise, light... so of course the first to fall were the families with young children. The elders were next, since fear can make you lose control, and they were more prone to fail.

We first didn't know what it was. We heard explosions, but they were far enough. We heard screams, some of them really close, and some rattling.

Then after a week, the first military forces came in town. they were reassuring. "No, things are under control". "Don't worry, it will be over soon"

*Soon*

It's been four years. We have since taken arms, but more in some kind of a guerrilla. The first raids were tried at nightfall, but it was definitely a bad idea. None of them came out of the streets.

We had to fight during the day. The enemy hates daylight, so we were fast to find it. Some people were talking about vampires, ghouls, and other fantasy names. But it was nothing like these. I saw one of them at my first raid. Gigantic, with big red eyes, sharp teeth, and a long tail which could cut a man in half easily. They look like giant rodents, kinda like giant rats, but with the muscles of kangaroos... and 2 meters tall.

I like to call them the Vermin. Except they are intelligent. Really intelligent. And strong.

They can't see, but their skin burn at sunlight. They seem to be able to track noise, some vibrations, and "feel" the light.

Four years...

After all this time, we had our small successes, and built some kind of stronghold around the town. And we are still alive so far, but that's up to us.

We are a small team of fighters who specialized in the fight against this enemy.
