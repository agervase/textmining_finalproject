Death leaned back, defeated. Only partially visible behind impossibly dark mist, he took a long drag from his cigarette. Raped his bony fingers on the table. His intense menacing red eyes had become less threatening, they were bewildered, both amused and annoyed. 

For the longest time he stayed quiet staring off, taping his fingers. The look one last drag then shifted his eyes to Quill, looking straight into his soul. A playful smile rose to Deaths face, exposing his rotting fangs, and he let out a disturbing snicker. Shivers went down quills back and he gulped. He hoped Death didn’t notice he was shaking. Of course Death didn’t need to see him shaking to know how he was feeling, and Death loved it. 

“You know...” An raspy voice grumbled. It was Ancient yet almost enthusiastic. Death spoke on.
“No ones ever beat me.” Death was focused on the chess board.  The centrepiece to the lightless universe Quill was sent to immediately after dying. “Billions of people and no one has won. Huh” he sighed and put his hands on the table.

Quill just stared back at him, jaw hanging open. Its not too often Quill is at a loss for words, but staring at A distraught and confused Death was one of them. 

“Should I punish you or reward you? Hmmm... probably reward, but damn. I had a really fucking long streak going.” Death mumbled, still staring off. Quill didn’t notice. “I guess I could give your life back... but the council doesn’t really like that... lotta red tape. Hmm. Ya like killing people?”
Quill was deep in his own anxious thoughts. 𝐼 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑑. 𝐶𝑕𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 𝑡𝑕𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑙. 𝑇𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒, 𝐼 𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑚, 𝑎𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔. 𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑎𝑏𝑦𝑠𝑠. 𝐿𝑒𝑡 𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑢-“

Oi! Death barked snapping his fingers. Quill jumped up, back to the chess game in limbo.
“I said, do you like killing?”
Quill stared, puzzled. Then quickly sparked up, “Never done it, don’t care to. Something else.”

Death raised his eyebrows. “Sure, let me get me pamphlet for you to choose what victory package ya want.” His eyes were switching back to that menacing shade of red. 

“Okay, okay” Quill replies motioning it with his hands. “Can you just pull some strings to get me back on earth?”

“I could.”
“Okay ... so..?” Quill was raising his eyebrows hope gleaming in his eyes.
“I could but I won’t. I can make you a  spirit? You’d be able to fuck around with people” Death said laughing to himself by the end of it.

“I was thinking that... but that would get boring super fast. Nah, no deal.  Come on, you’re the devil, you can do better then that.” It was Quills turn to laugh.

“I can fix three physical or mental disabilities pm loving people of your choice. Fully fixed, miracle material.”

Quill looked like he was pondering this offer. “There’s ailments on one person, or one on three people?”
The devil smiled, in a cheery voice beamed “I don’t really give a fuck! I’ll give grandma another arm for all I care! Don’t be cheeky with me, you smug idiot.” Still grinning his off-putting smile.
