The day I found out my car could transform, it definitely changed my life. Not necessarily for the best, but not for the worst, either. I'm not talking transform like Transformers, but rather, it just sorta altered itself in certain ways. The other day it was raining hard enough to wash all the pigment out of a black cotton tee shirt, and my Chevrolet Spark had become a hovercraft. Due to the recent cold and wet weather, it changed into a Silverado with studded ice tires when the temperature dropped to 10 below freezing early in the morning yesterday.

I woke up today, groggy as usual, got dressed, had a full pot of coffee, and walked to the garage. Normally, I'd keep my keys in the door on the keychain (the car keys themselves would change, but the other keys and keychains would stay the same), except that the car keys weren't there. I disarmed my security system, opened the door to the garage and peered in. My garage was big enough for both my Spark and at least 2 Suburbans to fit inside, but what I saw made me do a double take.

"I know a magically changing car is crazy, but *a tank?*" I thought to myself. Then I remembered why it changed. I slammed the door to the garage and rushed back inside to check the news. The TV couldn't get a signal, so, panicked, I checked my phone. Apparently, North Korea decided it was a great time to attack the U.S., and their first target was the state of Texas.

I packed up as much as I could, got my cats into their carriers, and started packing everything into the M1 Abrams that barely fit in the garage. Thankfully an instruction manual lay inside, and after what felt like the longest 5 minutes of my life, I had managed to get on the road and escape.

~by the way, this is my first real attempt at writing, go easy on me!
