Jeremy was shaking. This would be his first day as a fully fledged member of the infamous “10-4 Blue” street gang. The group had emerged suddenly just over three months ago and had grown shockingly fast since then. As the most promising member of Central City’s VICE unit, Jeremy had been tasked with infiltrating the gang and gathering enough evidence to bring convictions against their top leadership. He had dyed his hair blond, shaved his beard, and now wore blue colored contact lenses. For all intents and purposes, Jeremy was now David, a 21 year old street punk looking for a bigger piece of the pie.


The forty-something head of new recruits at 10-4, a name thought to intentionally mock the police who so futilely tried to stop them, looked Jeremy up and down. He had stern eyes and speckled salt and pepper hair. His strong build towered over Jeremy and his voice rumbled like thunder.

“You are green kid,” he said, “very green.”

“Sir I may be green but I will do what I have to.”, Jeremy responded.

“Good”, a smile flashed across his face, “lets see just what you are willing to do.”

Jeremy’s first mission would be simple: rob a liquor store that had failed to pay protection money. He would be accompanied by another new recruit, Sam, and a more veteran gang member, named Rick.

“Alright, listen up.”, Rick said when they were all together, “you all are new, and so you do whatever I say, whenever I say it. Otherwise someone is going to die.”

“Yes sir.”, came the reply.

They left close to sunset, hoping to catch the store right as they were closing. On the way they drove past a Dunkin’ Donuts.

“Let’s stop and grab some coffee”, Sam suggested, “so we are all alert for this.”

The other two agreed and pulled into the parking lot. Rick elected to stay in the car, instead giving his order: black coffee, no cream or sugar, to Jeremy. As Jeremy and Sam entered the store, Sam froze.

“Heya Robert!”, the clerk said, “I just got transferred here from across town, funny seeing you here, I thought your beat was east of the river.”

“Your beat?”, Jeremy was incredulous, “what the hell is going on Sam?”

“Listen man”, Sam pleaded, “you can’t tell anyone. I’m actually an undercover cop, I will do this job and then quit, and I won’t tell no one. I swear, just don’t tell Rick or I’m dead.”

Jeremy was stunned. “Sam, or I guess Robert, I am too. What department?”

“East Side PD, we sent someone in a month ago and haven’t heard anything. So I got sent in to figure out what was going on.”

“Well I won’t tell anyone, and you can’t tell anyone about me. Let’s just do this job.”, Jeremy assured Sam.

“Hands in the air everybody! You move, you get shot.”, Jeremy screamed. It had been one month since the liquor store robbery, and he had moved up to banks. Next to him Sam waved an automatic rifle around.

“Shut up shut up shut up!”, he yelled maniacally, pointing the gun at random people.

Rick walked up to the teller. “Put the money in the bag and no one gets hurt”, he calmly informed the shaking woman. “Just do as I say.”

Rick was also an undercover officer. Keyword: was. The money was too good and the risk too low for him to go back to the force. In fact, all the members of 10-4 Blue were former officers of the law. The shrinking pension plans and stagnating pay drove many of them to try and make some money on the side. Soon after, they quit and formed the gang. Now, after four months, they controlled most of the west side of the city. Their knowledge of already present criminal organizations and police procedures made them uniquely equipped to be successful.

Across the river, in the East Side Police Department, they had uncovered some shocking footage. A bank’s security camera had captured the heist earlier in the day, and one of the officers recognized Sam.

“What the hell do we do about this?”, the chief asked his remaining advisors. “We have lost nigh half the force to this gang, and other departments report the same losses. It was alright when it was just petty crime and robberies, but now they’ve started moving drugs and weapons.”

“I’ll fix it”, came the reply from a dark corner. “Let me go in. In two months 10-4 Blue won’t exist anymore.”

“You sure about this Jack?”, the chief asked, “after all, you’re only a few weeks away from retirement.”

“Oh I’m sure.”
