**EDIT:** If anyone is confused by the dialogue/font, there were different fonts for the sake of more "realistic" story-telling.

Brackets ("[  ]") denote that the dialogue is supposed to be in "Galactic Standard," the language of all Pan-Galactic Union citizens. I didn't have enough time or thought to create all of the dialogue in a language I had just invented.

**Bold** for the dialogue for which I was able to write "Galactic Standard."

*Italics* are for the narrator's bits of internal dialogue.

Anything else in quotation marks, assume it's Standard English.

Sorry for the confusion, now the story:

["So I went to this planet bro. It's just-It's just, the mos-...it's just the most awesome place to get some if you know what I mean."]

["Are the Dirt girls really that easy?"]

*Oh for fuck's sake, don't bring up any puns made with movie names.*

["You wanna know for yourself? Let's bring the Glorbla House for Dirt Spring Break"]

*Just pronounce it right dipass. It's "Earth."*

["Bro, I heard they had Oppalango porn on Dirt a thousand years ago bro... a hundred years ago bro! I know for a fact we can get mad laid if we bring Glorbla House to Japan."]

The Oppalango who just said that looked to the side in my direction and then back at his Poppobraca friend who initially brought up "Dirt."

["You know those "Dirt" people are just coming over to the Union and taking all of our fucking jobs. **And** they don't bother to learn Galactic Standard."]

He glances over at me again.

["Can you imagine if an entire race of laborers are allowed free tuition at the Milky Way University System? My tax Deuyoncs can't pay for that shit."]

*Fuck, this guy's way done. Better cut them off easy. They've been shitty tippers all night anyways and I need the money for my tuition.*

**"Wace traaux biaeska Gentleman?"**

The Poppibraca looked to the side in a drunken stupor.

["Excuse me? Oh yeah, I need- I need- Actually, I'm good, can you call me a shuttle bro? I'm not looking to get a PWI. Even though my Dad's a Pan-Gal Barrister, he said he would take away the Porsche if I got in trouble"]

The Oppalango looked over.

["You know bro, your Gal-Stand is pretty- pretty good, fo-for... for a human. What-When... Where did you learn it? When did you come to Nora?"]

**"Taebonas tock Nora. Galuu Leonga yeui leonga chuupril daece."**

["You're so well-spoken. So, is it... So, is it true that..."]

*Don't fucking ask. Oh please, just don't ask.*

["Is it true that..."]

The Oppalango lowered his head and his voice.

["Is it true that humans have a-"]

**Quopo wace Taxi traieska?**

["Oh yeah. Me and the Poppibraca over here my Primpi."]

The driver got them out of the bar as I pulled him to the side.

"Alright, they're both very drunk and they need to be dropped off as soon as possible. I have their shipping license right here and their address is on here. Don't take them to the address because that's half a jump away from Nora. They said Glorbla- yeah, exactly, **that** house- is where they're staying. MW Nora student as well?"

"Yeah, Sophomore Political Science major. But yeah, I got you man."

*Jesus, what a shit show. For fuck's sake, even Earth racists know to look side to side before saying that kind of shit. Oh damn, Xenvilian coming right here and she's got a Noradian friend. Play it cool. Play it-*

"Konnitagas Ladies, how're you doing tonight?"

["Oh my gawd, I love Earth accents. Don't you? Oh, he's cute. Don't say a thing about this to the girls at Aclopo House. I could lose my bid if I go home with tonight. I just heard that they, you know have... Oh shit, stop fucking laughing, you know it's true. It's why you were dating Dave even when your Noradian parents were against it. I just heard that Xenvilians and humans just make the cutest babies."]

"So, **wace biaeska**? Tequila is cheap tonight."

"Yeah... Tequila, nice would- would nice be... would be nice? [Oh my gawd! Did I say it right even with my Xenvilian accent?]"

*Well, for all of bigoted thoughts and ideas out there, might as well swallow this one and get laid tonight.*
