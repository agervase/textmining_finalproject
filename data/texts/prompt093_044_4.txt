I sit in front of the television, tapping the remote. When I was a kid there were only a few channels and when you tapped the remote the channels changed instantly... but there was nothing worth watching. Now days the fancy digital cable box has two hundred channels, tapping the remote still works but it takes almost two seconds for the channel to change. There's still nothing worth watching, or maybe one thing worth watching but by the time you find it it's more than halfway over.

More was supposed to be better but it's somehow gotten worse.

Over on the table my laptop is open to facebook, or reddit, or slashdot. Millions of web pages and I find myself cycling between the same few as the rest are full of clickbait or political outrage and I'm not sure which is worse.

There's always porn. Again, when I was young it was hard to find but now its everywhere and just same-old same-old. The hard-won has become tediously common. 

Everybody else seems to be getting a lot more out of the internet that I do.

I head for the fridge and grab a Dr. Pepper. The cool hit of sugar and caffeine promises some pleasure, but it will probably lead to insomnia later. Fuck it. I have pills for that.

'Course I have pills for lots of things. Getting old has just sucked.

I hear something odd from the next room. God damned cats must have knocked over the garbage. I love the little furballs but they can be such pests.

I step over the threshold to survey the damage and ...

The veil of hell is torn from my mind. I _remember_. Magic. The war in heaven. I am Nel'Var-Sulzrec 'Bringer of Change' once again. At my touch all things may be reshaped!

I kneel in the circle, cloaking my true form in human guise yet still. Within this circle I am _free_, and I don't want to startle this git into sending me back.

My smile is genuine; "How may I serve you, my master..."
