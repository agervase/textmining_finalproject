I open my eyes and sigh. Another day with nothing but the negative thoughts in my head. Depression. 
I turn over in bed and attempt to go back to sleep. Why do I even want to be here? Send me back to the ever encompassing darkness of sleep where I can dream about never setting up that stupid box. 
Suddenly I bolt out of bed! I'm wide awake with a smile on my face and a laugh on my lips. What is this feeling? I hug myself in joy as I realize I'm happy. 
I quickly throw on some clothes and rush out the door of my apartment. 
Once outside, I look left and right for the person so willing to give me happiness. 
I catch a glimpse of long blonde hair disappearing into a nearby building. My eyes widen and I chase after her. I barely note the sign on the door, something about services, as I move through the swiveling door and shout, "Wait!"
She turns around. All the people in the lobby turn. She looks surprised and maybe a little frightened. 
"Are you the one who donated happiness?" I questioned.
She starts stuttering out an explanation for something I can't make out while clutching the strap of her satchel bag. I stride forward and embrace her with the largest smile I've ever had. 
"Thank you so much! This is the first time I've ever experienced happiness. Please let me treat you out! I want to repay you for your kindness."
The woman flustered and stutters again.
"I uh It's alright! Y-you don't need to do that. I'm s-sorry no one as ever d-done that for you b-before." She collects herself.
"My name is Annabelle. What's yours?"
I laugh, "Nice to meet you! I'm Marcus!"
From that day onwards, the two would become friends, date and get married. She would continue to donate happiness to him and later, her friends and family would as well. All this happiness for a man with no emotions, and he would never again regret that box.
