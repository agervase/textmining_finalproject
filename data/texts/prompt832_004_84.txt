God bless America. I sold my soul the the devil, doing things for the country that I still see when my eyes close at night, and they returned the favor by trading me to some Quills for a box of quantum transcoders. 

It’s weird to have your life valued at approximately 234 hamburgers.

In a perverse way, I have to thank the CIA for being a bunch of cocks. When I got back from war, about three years prior to my sale, all I got was a free ‘thank you for your service’ every time I went somewhere in uniform. Nothing to help the PTSD, or put some food in my belly when it got too bad to see straight anymore. But over in Quambro, everybody is equally nobody. There’s no rich woman in gaudy furs complaining about her manicure that passes me when I’m lying on dirty stone. 

They feed me more than my home government did, even if it’s not exactly *gourmet dining*, and it’s warm full-cycle. We fight, those who win live another day and get a free meal. Those who don’t are dumped onto a lift and ejected into space like meatball fireworks. 

In the arena, we’re all equal. If I fight a rich man, he doesn’t get a fancy weapon or armor. He gets a tase-blade, same as me, and the weaker one dies. All that matters is skill. Power.

And after seventeen years, I still haven’t lost. A few nicks here and there, and an eye lost, but that’s nothing compared to a crushed head or being sliced in half. I, and all the other rejects on this shithole, are the strongest warriors this universe has seen.

And we’re fucking done fighting for show. 

It’s time to fight for ourselves.

A small planet. Then two, four, twelve, a system, a galaxy. We stole all these little turd planets no one cares to protetc, and now it’s time to take another step. Somewhere in the Imperium. Somewhere important.

I have a planet in mind.
