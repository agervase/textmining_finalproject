//I apologize in advance if this reply seems wobbly - I was super sleepy when I wrote this! Please enjoy!

Two anomalies have meet, are meeting, and will meet - one is an anomaly created by the finest minds of mankind, and the other being a pure one in a trillion chance of pure luck and biological coincidence.

I'm the latter. I've honestly lived for so long that my mind has been unable to remember where I began - but she tells me that she'd seen me pop up as early as 100 B.C. as a Barbarian protecting his land from the Roman Empire. I tell her she's crazy, she tells me she has seen it with her own eyes.

Right now it is, according to the Gregorian Calendar, the year 2018 - but she tells me she's so far from the future that such calendar had been discarded for something more scientific. 

"Fancy seeing you here. Come here often?" I ask the figure that sat down on the bench next to me - but the red, curly hair underneath that hat of hers makes it unmistakable to me that it's her.

"Oh, once in a while." She'd reply softly, her lips curling into a sly smile. "Not the most interesting time -- but you can enjoy a prolonged period of peace and rapid scientific progress." She said, raising her head as I turned mine, allowing me to look at her shining purple eyes. "Not that World War II or the Cold War is something you'd particularly miss?"

I can only smile, knowing very well that jokes about history and the future were now the bread and butter of our conversations. "Not particularly, no. If anything, I'm delighted that I won't need to re-learn my German or Russian." I smirk.

"Oh no - you absolutely must know Russian by 2030! It'll be the Universal language of the Earth!" She ushered me, though I merely looked at her with a raised brow, to which she responded with a giggle. "Joking, joking~."

"Glad to see comedy hasn't died in the future." I scoff.

"In many ways it has, I'm the only one keeping it alive." She gave a hearty laugh. I chuckled, not from the words, but just from seeing her so...lively and excited.

But the awkard silence that followed allowed a question to come to my mind as realization struck.

"Curious." I muse.

"What do you mean?" She gently tilts her head.

"We usually pop up in the middle of some kind of event, usually a gathering or a historical hotspot. Like when I saw you during Winston Churchill's speech, Martin Luther King's rallies, I even recall seeing you in Times Square on the New Year of 2000."

"Right?" She hummed. I can hear from her tone - she's caught onto me, and the fact I know she has a different reason to come here.

"Well..." I smile. "You're not gonna tell me that some kinda historical riot or catastrophe's gonna happen in this park, are you?"

She blinked quietly, and lowered her head as she hid her eyes from me. She smiled, but with the quiver of her lips, I detect the smile was a fake. 

"You're right." She whispered. "I...came for a different reason."

"Something involving me, I see?"

She nodded. "I...Don't quite know how to put this into words, but I have two conflicting confessions to make...One pleasant, the other...Not so much."

My curiosity is peaked as I cross one leg over another and turn my body to her's. "I like good news first. What's the pleasant one..."

"That doesn't make it easier to express!" She gasped out, then chuckling as she found my words humorous. "Ah, how do I put it..."

She coughed. "We've seen eachother a lot now - you with your biological gift and me with my tech...And, honestly, since I tend to escape my reality to go into time, you're really the only person I know, and--"

"With me living an immortal life, I barely have the time to get to know anyone, other than you..."

"R-Right." She nervously laughed. "...It's...Quite hard to tell who's popping up into whom's life...My point is..."

"I really adore you." She smiled.

I would've been more caught back by this, but...In a nice way, I'm not. I've lived for so long that few things surprise me, and I always think many steps ahead, like a professional chess player. But knowing that, after so many year-long gaps in our meetings, she felt the same way...I can't help but grin.

"Me too. I...Really do, too."

"But..." She turned her head away from me. "There in comes my...second confession..."

Remembering this, I frown. I feel tense - because never in my near two-thousand years of life I had ever seen her express any severely negative emotions.

"...Go on." I quietly say.

"What we have right now..." She whispered, looking at the Autumn leaves float onto the ground. "...I'm just...really scared."

"...Of what?" ...I ask.

"..." She took time to think, and doing her best to blink as much as she could to prevent tears. "I can't blink from time to time forever...Unlike you, I will naturally die in some hundred years, or however long the tech back at my time allows it."

I silently look at her as she turned her head to me, looking me straight in the eyes. "I-I'm scared because I've travelled far enough - and at no point have we achieved immortality. You are the first and last immortal human to ever live. I will die sooner or later...And, it's not only that I don't want to die..."

"...But what else is it?" I whisper.

"...I..." She sniffled softly. "I don't..."

She brought her forearm to her face, rubbing away at her eyes with her sleeve.

"I don't want to do this to you, damn it!" She gasped out quietly. "...I don't want to make you attached to me, because no matter how far back or ahead in time I jump, I can't do it forever. And I don't want to make you go through the heartbreak of outliving someone who's been with you almost your whole life!" She cried out, her voice becoming shakier. "I **age!** I will become older! E-Even if it's not a matter of time, at some point, I-I will just become an old lady living off of life support meds!" She exclaimed, and silently fell back on the bench.

A short moment passed.

I frown, and sigh. "I...Must say that...I, on the other hand...Have had my conerns too." I say. "Can I tell you something? But, please, promise not to become angry with it."

Suppressing her sobs, she nodded.

"Seeing you is...It's become a part of my life. Each time I see you, I feel sharp, incredible spikes of happiness. No matter how many years it is apart, just seeing you somewhere, getting to talk to you for just a few hours once every some decades or even century, it makes me happy. But like you, I fear two things. The thing I fear the most are larger gaps in how often we meet - or worse, that I'll ever stop meeting you..."

My lips quiver, but I do what I can to stomach it. "But secondly? I don't want to do this to you either. I understand you're escaping reality - I don't want to become this anchor in time that you keep returning to. I don't want to ruin your life by being a force that will outlive you no matter how much you can bend time."

"A-And I don't want to ruin your life either..." She whispered.

...

We spent half an hour just sitting at the bench. Quietly. I watched cloud patterns in the sky, she watched red leaves break away from their branches and glide across the park. We didn't look at each other, because we were afraid that the other would be hurt by having to look at us.

It is as I began to notice the shape of a horse in the clouds that I felt a hand intertwine its fingers with mine...Silently, I intertwined mine with hers. I turn to her, finding her eyes wet, and only now I realize that despite her flawless beauty, she had never worn makeup. A wavy, sad, yet, happy smile is on her face. I give a calm, kind smile in turn.

"Are all girls from the future as stunning as you?" I smirk.

"H-Heh, w-what, already wanna get to living in the future?" She softly scoffed.

"Not really." I rest back on the bench with a wide smile. "As long as you exist - past, present, or future...I'm more than satisfied with what I've got."

She took my hand with both of hers, and I would take both of her hands with mine. We spent a moment staring into eachother's eyes. We were both defeated, but hopeful. We searched for a light in the abyss of bittersweet darkness.

"Funny how...Through time and space, the only constant that remains the same is fate..." She smiled. "How I meet you every once in a while...How we always seem to be at the same place--"

"At the ***same time?***" I smirk.

"H-Heh..." She shook her head. "All I want to say is...Meeting you, and being your friend...It was more than worth all of this."

"I feel exactly the same. Despite all of these cursed years of seeing the world around me rot and decay, to see my close ones die..." I gently brush some hair out of her face. "...You're the best blessing an immortal man could ever ask for. Thank you."

"No..." She sniffled. "Thank you..."

Under the red Autumn trees, sitting at the bench, we hugged each other and held one another tightly, closely. All of my centuries of immortality felt nowhere as near as long as the moment during which we held eachother in a mutual embrace of what lasted a total of twenty minutes.

I'd see her many more times in my life - but rather to observe history unfold, she'd come to visit me. Some days she'd stay over for days, weeks...Sometimes as long as a month. Over time, I would see her become more mature, and age. As thousands of years passed, she appeared again and again. We cherished these moments.

We both have been blessed with incredible feats and abilities - but in our union, we found a curse. A curse of limitation and imperfection. 

But together, we took the best out of the curse, and made it a blessing.

I can't quite tell how the story ends, neither can I tell you where it begins. I only remember the best days I've ever had, am having, and will have with her. My life was decided for me - but in the fact that it decided to allow me to spend much of my immortality with her, is the thing I am most grateful for.

Thank you, my dearest, closest friend in my immortal past, future, and present.
