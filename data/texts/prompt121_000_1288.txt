“Master Wayne”

Alfred walked into the Wayne Manor’s study, barely passing the threshold of the lavish office. 

“Yes, Alfred.”

Bruce looked up from the shiny fragment he had stolen during the Justice Leagues battle with braniac. Normally he would take care of this in the Batcave, but bringing the tech near the Earth’s most connected computer system seemed like a bad idea.

“You have a visitor. A Mr. Johnathan Wick.”

Bruce remained stoic as he puts the fragment in his desk, gets up and walks towards his trusted aide. 

“Where?”

“In the parlor.” Alfred replied. 

Bruce took a quick glance out of the office window, and then swiftly left to meet Mr. Wick.

John Wick is looking at the Wayne family portraits adorning the walls as Bruce walks in. 

“John Wick.”

“Bruce Wayne.”

Bruce points at a chair for John. Both men take their seats. 

“What brings you to Gotham?”

“Business.”

“Business?” quizzed Bruce.

“Look Bruce. You know what I do. You know where I make my money. And you are a smart guy. You know why I’m here.”

Bruce’s glare did not waiver. “How much?” 

“$35 million upfront. More if I make you suffer.”
John leans forward in his chair.

“But neither of us wants that long of a night, old friend.”

Bruce smiles, “I’ll transfer you 80 million tonight. But what are we going to do about your friends outside?”

The shadows of several people overtake the large window in the room. 

John smiles. “Criminals these days have no tact. They tailed me. On a single lane road. In the middle of the country. Thought we’d have some fun.”

Bruce rolls up his sleeves. “I count 22 people. Same bet as in Marrakesh?”

John nods and pulls out his gun. Bruce glares. John puts his gun on the table.

John relents. “Fine. No killing.”
