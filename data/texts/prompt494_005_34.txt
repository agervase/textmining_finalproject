Gehrman sighed, his long, bony fingers resting upon the wheels of the chair. "I suppose you think you're a more worthy hunter than those before you?" He gestured to the graves on a nearby hill, only a few dozen, but already their names and stories were becoming indistinguishable in his mind. "The waking world cannot persist if I allow someone like you to wander through it."  


The hunter looked back at him, steadfast. Finally, he muttered, "I did not ask for your permission, I will not let myself be vanquished so easily. I can't go back to that doomed world, let myself live as a commoner again, ignorant of the creatures of the higher plane, letting my very soul be studied by creatures that look upon with indifferent disdain."  


"So you see them too," Gehrman smiled. "Yes... I can see how the paleblood reflects off your eye, your pupil is already starting to rot-"  


"I am not one of them!" The hunter snapped, spit flowing off his teeth as he wiped his face. "They have no remorse, no mercy. I would have never joined the hunt if they left me with a family to return to." He lifted his cane and slammed it upon the ground, as he did before each hunt. The blades elegantly unfolded in elegant motion, revealing a vicious serrated whip. It was pristine, polished with care after every hunt in the workshop, where he would talk with Gehrman for hours to distract himself from the cruelty of the hunt.  "If you wish to stand in my way, you are no better than the beasts we hunt."  


Gehrman stood from his chair, his joints ached, but his body moved as fluidly as it did on his first hunt. He reached behind his back and his blade unfolded, gears locking in to reveal a tremendous scythe. "You must accept your death. Be freed from the night."  


  


  
First time trying something here, so I tried to do an adaption off Bloodborne because it fit the prompt. (Can't guarantee it's lore-friendly.) Only had a few minutes so it's a lot briefer than I like.
