Everyone's a liar.  Well, used to be anyways.  Now theres only a few of us left with this curse.  Most of us were caught pretty soon: the habitual liars, the fabricators, or just the fools who couldn't keep their mouths shut.  I was never a big liar, so after the little bumps early on it wasn't a problem.  I had to get used to all the little lies we say every day.  I learned the "How are you doing?" and "You busy?" of everyday life can be a disaster if you aren't paying attention.  But eventually, I got the hang of just keeping it simple.  You can always tell the truth in a simple frame of mind, its how the truers get by with just a "Could be better".

But for me, I had another trick.  I only bent the truth in my favor when I REALLY needed to.  When I'm the last candidate for the job and I can look them straight in the eyes and say "I'm the best man for this".  You see, the real trick to lying now is that's my trump card. 

Except today I messed up.  I should have paid better attention.  Hell, theres a million things I should have done.  But you see, its the smallest lies we tell ourselves, those are the real lies.  You can't change those, no matter what stupid tricks you use.  And I'm gonna have to live with this.

The world sure changed with all the truers running around.  I wouldn't say things got better, but people sure did, but I could never figure it out.  See, what I never noticed before is that I can still lie to myself.  That's the most dangerous thing to do, and they can't anymore.  When they say something, it is or will be.  

Today, all the pieces fell into place.  I get it now.  And I definitely should NOT have told my wife I'd clean the house.  Its always the damn little things.
