A chill descended over the rag-tag assembly, and neither their small, poorly-made fire nor the tattered remains of their business casual attire served to warm them. Their conversation dropped from a murmur to a hush at the sound of a cracking branch.

Jane’s eyes darted to the source of the noise. “Hey--” she nudged the man sitting beside her, “do you see that gaunt, lanky-looking fellow?”  

**Hello.**  


The survivors nearly jumped out of their sweater-vests. They quickly turned around towards the voice as they waited for Jane, the group’s *de facto* leader, to speak.  
“Who are you? And why are you wearing that robe? You’re not some kind of, er, cultist, I hope.”  

**I am Death.**  


Wilbur, the *de jure* Head of Foraging and a former corporate account, blinked twice and reminded the survivors that he had advised *against* eating the canned food Jane found earlier that night.  

**The canned food was perfectly edible. You are not dead yet.**  

“Oh,” said Jane, “then what is it that you want?”  


Death explained his predicament to the survivors. In the realm of Death and Death-related services, an apocalypse is about as close to a market bubble as one can come. When Death was reaping souls by the thousands, business was booming. Death had even purchased a new, state-of-the-art scythe to keep up with the demand. The trouble, Death explained, is that a scythe – especially the UltraCarbon MetaFiber SoulCleaver Deluxe with satellite radio – is an expensive tool.  

**The heart of the problem is this: There are not enough human souls left to collect. As it stands, I have no hope of paying off the loan on my new scythe. And even if I were to pay off the loan, that would be the end for humanity. I would become…**  

Death shook his head, unable to finish the sentence. “Well, go on” Jane urged.  
 
**…unemployed.**  


“I have a solution!” Jane and Wilbur simultaneously exclaimed. They jolted towards each other, each trying to pierce the other by means of eyes alone. Ever since the minutes after the apocalypse, when this small and bureaucratic group of survivors had drafted their *Memoranda and Procedure for Life and Leadership in the Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland*, Jane and Wilbur had been fighting an unspoken war. Jane was a natural leader, and the survivors tended to follow her directions. She believed that the key to rebuilding society was well-intentioned and virtuous leadership. But Wilbur had been enshrined in the *Memoranda* as the group’s rightful leader, and he believed that that the key to rebuilding society was careful attention to established rules and hierarchies with an even more careful eye kept on the lookout for loopholes.  

**I am sure that you both have excellent solutions. I would like to first hear that of Wilbur, and then that of Jane.**  


Wilbur strode calmly and authoritatively around the fire as he began his address to Death and the survivors,  

“Clearly, Mr. Death, you are faced with a grave difficulty. In the time it would take to rebuild human society and restock the population, interest will accrue such that you may become unable to repay your loan. Therefore, I propose that you repay your loan by grouping future human souls that we can be sure will, at some point in time, exist and promising those to the bank.”   

**We do not have such complicated financial systems, Wilbur. It seems risky.**  
 
Wilbur sat back down, looking decidedly content. Jane glowered at him and began to speak,  

“Mr. Death, if I may be blunt, Wilbur’s plan is terribly hazardous. What we need to do is to ensure the steady and rapid re-growth of human society. I have been devising multiple highly efficient agricultural techniques based on a book I found at the—“  

**Stop.**  
 
“Wha- why?”  

**You are taking too long. And you were being shrill. I choose Wilbur’s plan.**  


Jane returned to her seat by the fire and thought, “Of course, Death’s a sexist.” The place where Death had been standing shimmered slightly as he popped out of existence – or, it would be more accurate to say, began existing in a different dimension – and then returned to its normal state of emptiness.  


Death walked through the void that was the Interdimensional Bank of Souls’ foyer and politely requested to speak with the high officials. His request was granted. Although even the highest officials at the Bank had never heard of the financial wizardry that Death proposed to them, they figured that as long as they got their payment it didn’t matter when they actually received the souls. Death had never failed to deliver souls to them, and besides, he had a big shiny new scythe – with satellite radio! They considered his debt paid.  


A great length of time passed. Jane, Wilbur, and all of the other survivors died. Most of them failed to have children. Their faded khakis and tattered sweater-vests decomposed along with the rest of their bodies, as their few children also grew old and also failed to procreate. Their children had no sweater-vests, so they wore furs. Their furs decomposed as well. And so on, and so on, until there were no more garments to decompose in the mud and no more humans to make garments.   


Up until now things had been going really, really well for the Interdimensional Bank of Souls. Executives and shareholders alike were thrilled by the novel technique Death had taught them, which was able to turn a Post-Apocalyptic Soul Recession into an unprecedented boom.   


It was at this point, however, that things began to go really, really poorly. Without any humans to harvest souls from there was no longer any usable currency. And since the currency in existence had been based upon the speculation that human souls would exist at a given time in the future, interdimensional beings discovered not only that their currency was worthless but that it had, in fact, been worthless for quite a long time. Suffice it to say that the Soul Economy crashed so rapidly and thoroughly that interdimensional society as a whole ceased to exist.

Some time after the crash a group of interdimensional beings sat gathered around a cosmic energy vortex. They detected a slight decrease in ambient temperature as well as the presence of a large mass distorting space-time. Death nudged the being at his side and asked if she detected the anomaly. She gave a disinterested nod. The anomaly slowly drew nearer. Death inhaled sharply as the anomalous lifeform loomed over him. It looked at the hodge-podge group of interdimensional beings, with their tattered robes and pathetically small energy vortex, and it said,  

**Hello.**
