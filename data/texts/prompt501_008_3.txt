This prompt reminded me of one of my favorite RPG universes. Welcome the Alpha Complex and the wonderful of Paranoia, where a psychotic computer rules with a copper fist.

---

„WELCOME TO EXPRESS LANE 47-A. PLEASE ENJOY YOUR RIDE CITIZEN. HAPPINESS IS MANDATORY. THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND.”

John-Y-BGD 2 looked around and beamed happily into the camera. He couldn’t see one at the moment, but it payed not to take chances. The Computer loved it’s citizens and wanted them to be happy. And how could one not be happy living in the wonderful utopia of the Alpha Complex. Only a mutant commie traitor, brainwashed by a secret society would fail to be happy. The Computer had to be vigilant on behalf of his citizens. It did not love traitors. Not one bit.

The cruise control of his transport unit was automatically set to exactly 55 miles per hour, so he had about half an hour to go, before he arrived at his new job. His first clone John-R-BGD 1 had worked long and hard for red clearance and had valiantly sacrificed his life in the fight against treason. This had brought him a posthumous promotion to yellow clearance, while the rest of the team was reassigned to give the interior of reactor core N0H0P3 a good scrubbing. 

Suddenly the transport unit he had just passed exploded. Probably one of the overhead laser cannons. He wondered what his fellow citizen, err that ruthless traitor must have done to be incinerated by the burning gaze of his friend the Computer, when the intercom came to live:

“ATTENTION ALL CITIZENS. THE SPEED LIMIT OF 50 MILES PER HOUR WILL BE VIGOROUSLY ENFORCED. PLEASE ENJOY DAY CITIZEN. HAPPINESS IS MANDATORY. THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND.”

Johnn-Y-BGD had emptied his pistol into engine compartment less than a second later and his vehicle came to a quick and rather painful stop. Two more transport units exploded close by.

“CITIZEN JOHN-Y-BGD 2, WHY HAS YOUR TRANSPORT UNIT CEASED TO OPERATE?”

“Greetings friend computer it is always a pleasure to converse with you. What a wonderful day. I had reason to suspect sabotage by treasonous elements. In order minimize damage to the control unit I disabled the engine so a forensic team might find evidence of tampering.”

“PROCESSING RESPONSE...”

He heard the distinct humming of a large laser cannons capacitor charging up behind him and forced an even broader smile on his face.

“ARE YOU SWEATING FRIEND CITIZEN?”

“That is only the heat from the burning vehicles friend Computer. Thank you for your interest in my well being.”

“PROCESSING …”

“RESPONSE 76% PLAUSIBLE. TERMINATION POSTPONED”.

“YOU HAVE DONE WELL FRIEND CITIZEN. THE ALPHA COMPLEX IS IN YOUR DEBT. A FINE OF 500 CREDITS WILL BE CHARGED FOR NON TREASONOUS DESTRUCTION OF COMPUTER PROPERTY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. HAVE A NICE DAY.”

Two near death experiences before he had even attended the mission briefing. That must be a new record.
