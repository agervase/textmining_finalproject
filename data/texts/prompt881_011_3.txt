Winter has come, the sky's grey and the streets are very crowded. You can barley walk without hitting people holding their magnetic umbrella. Even if it is night, my sight is still sharp. I can smell it from miles, their blood, it gives me chill. My employee's instructions were clear as a bell. I have my checklist. It includes fourteen names of all genders and ages.
