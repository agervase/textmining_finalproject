The buzz of mental voices around me was like white noise. I'd grown up with it and now that I was 18 years old I was pretty used to the endless buzzing of it. Once in a while someone would be interesting enough for me to pick up on, but other than that--

*I know you're listening.*

I froze, my pencil hovering over the notebook page. 

*I know you're listening.*

I casually itched my nose and began doodling on the page, glancing up once in a while to look around the library to see people's faces.

*I know you're listening.*

There! A guy with glasses and parted hair that was slicked down with grease, wearing a green polo under a grey jacket, and khaki slacks with white tennis shoes. He was focusing on the air in front of him, forehead furrowed.

*I know you're listening.* His eyes squinted a little as the mental thought hit my brain again.

I rubbed my temples. I needed to get out of here. If this guy didn't stop he would give me a headache. I began gathering my things, putting them in my backpack.

*I know you're listening!*

God, it was like water torture! I tried my best to pretend like I wasn't cursed with this stupid gift as I zipped my backpack and slung it on my back, walking as inconspicuously away as I could.

*I know you're listening.*

*Fuck you, asshole, some of us are trying NOT to listen!* I sent as aggressively as possible, turning to see pain shoot across his face as I pushed out the double doors. I sighed with relief as he looked confusedly around and promised myself that the next time I saw this inconsiderate asshole, I would mentally blast his brain until he made a point never to think consciously again.
