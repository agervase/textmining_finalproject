The surgeon called it. T.O.D. 11:55 pm and to tag me and bag me. The second hand is the last thing I hear as I lay motionless on the gurney. They take the oxygen off and close me up. Always ticking. I glance over to my wife on the other side of the gallery crying into the arms of the surgeon. The clock is slowing down, I shed a tear as I look at my beautiful wife for the last time. The ticking echoes on last time, it's now midnight. 

They say death is like slipping into a warm bath, but they're lying. Time stops and melts into the background. Everything fades away leaving the black backdrop of an endless, starless void. I'm still in my hospital gown and I already miss my wife. The tunnel part is right but the gate keeper is always there waiting for you...

"Ready?" the masked figure shouted without mouth. The dainty stone chess set appeared out of nowhere, centuries of wear could be seen on each piece. I could see why this was intimidating. We covered the ground rules and the wager... unfortunately I cheated and the three move check mate left Death stunned. I guess the meds hadn't worn off yet, although it was a cheap move it was the only move I could afford. "So be it!" and Death clapped twice....then again....and again..."CLEAR!"....and then the buzz of a defibrillator. 

I was back! They called it a miracle. After I was hooked back up to every machine known to man and tubes shoved in multiple outlets within me my wife came and hugged me. Sobbing she said, "Don't you dare leave me alone again!" As I hugged my with I saw a candy striper leave past the window... holding the same Queen I had used to win, her rye smile letting me know that the game wasn't over and the house always wins.
