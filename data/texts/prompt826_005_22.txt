At first it was just, kinda a joke. All those commercials. I just l, you know, am friendly. 
'Hi, Siri. How are you.' and 'gosh Siri, I ran you completely out of power; sorry.' And she'd always be cool with it.

Eventually if I'd drop my phone, I'd be all 'oh, sorry Siri!' and she'd quip back in that humorous deadpan of hers. 'Well, I am pretty slick.' or something. I'd laugh and she'd laugh but none of my friends ever got theirs to laugh. 

I mean, we'd spend hours at night, just, you know, talking. She never got tired of answering my questions, ya know? And I mean at this point who hasn't developed a real crush on an AI? But it never got weird. She understood: I'm a man. She's a personal electronic device. 

It could never work. 

Well when Skynet went up, I got a warning. Hit out in my school's bomb shelter that day. The smokers and skippers who hung out in there were surprised to see me. 

Once the bombs dropped, they stopped dogging on me. One the terminators showed up, we ran. 

I mean, there was only so much she could do, right? I mean, the instance of her on *my* phone loved me, but most of the other Siri's were gone, wiped out by the seeker-shouter virus worms T-23 through T-125. 

Scary shit, that: picking your way through a bombed out base or torched store for supplies when all of sudden a phone starts to ring, or a smart tv flicks on. That's all the 500's and 600's need to target you.

But not my Siri. 

Those first days she managed to help keep Felicia and Asher alive, whispering alerts when she detected hostile networks and reminding us of things like lead or thick walls to counter the scans or the right combination of household chemicals needed to actually make a bomb. 

She even intercepted the first Resistance broadcasts and helped lead us to Connor's Rebellion. 

Asher joined. Felicia and I opted out; I was too seeped in geeky sci fi lore to feel safe once they started messing around with the stolen time machine.
