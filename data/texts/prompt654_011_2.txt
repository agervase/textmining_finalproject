"So what is your power exactly?"

"I can phase through any matter I want, but when I do light can't reflect off my eyes and oxygen can't go through my lungs, and sound can't resonate off my eardrums so I'm blind, deaf, and unable to breath when using it"

Of all the powers I've heard, this one is possibly the hardest to use

"Well, let's try something simple. I want you to try and our just your arm through my chest. Focus, use your power on just your arm"

He held his breath and pushed his arm against my chest, and his arm came out my back.

"Good. Now ju--"

Before I could finish my sentence, he fell through the floor. After getting back up to me I asked if he was alright

"Yeah, I'm fine. This is harder than I thought it would be. Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath?"

"No, you probably shouldn't. Try again, this time with your opposite arm. Remember, breath easy and you'll be able to activate it on any part of your body you want"

His other arm went through me flawlessly.

"Good. Now, I want you to jump through that wall, just deactivate your power before you hit the ground"

"Ok, I'll give it a try"

He ran, and for a moment I thought he would simply hit the wall, but he managed to make it through the wall, but also through the ground. He eventually came back up

"Wait a second, if I can just come back out of the ground then what's the point of trying to go through just the wall?"

"Because it teaches control, and since you have no way to know where you are it can help you with estimating where you are, giving you a sort of sixth sense. Try it again, but don't let yourself be pushed out of the wall, try to deactivate it before you touch the ground but after you've cleared the wall"

After a while he finally got it

"Good job! Well, that's the end of today's session. I hope to help you in the future. What was you're name again?"

"Mirio"
