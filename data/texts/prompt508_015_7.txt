Day 300,

The human boy is back with his pet, that dark one from across the sea. He is bigger than when they first dragged me through the city gates. Soon he will be big enough to make a decent meal. The dark one is a problem though. He never leaves his master's side, and the other prisoners all fear him. The other prisoners are not Drak. They do not have claws to rip or fangs to tear. We will see about this pet soon. 

Day 303,

The boy and his pet are visiting daily. They do not speak to me, they speak at me. Questions I cannot answer in their ugly tongue. The boy wants to know why I didn't fight. He says that Drak never come quietly. "I am more than Drak," I say to myself after they leave. "I am Grahhh The Everlasting. I am Grahhh The Quiet. I am Grahhh, with the quick slash in the dark." 

Day 378,

I have gathered that the boy is called Tal. It took me a long time to distinguish this from the human word "tall." I confess myself disappointed in my lack of perception. The brown one sounds like Aree-us. It is not a word I have heard them use to refer to anything else, at least. 

Tal is sad today. He cries before my bars, screaming about a man named Ram. Aree-us does not try to stop him. He only glares at me, and there is something familiar in his eyes. This man is also a killer. 

Day 379,

I awoke to realization. As I slept, images crawled through my mind of a human, many years ago, whi ventured too far west. I was already very old when he wandered into my camp, and my memory has only continued to fade. I recall his scream as I drove his own spear into his gut. One word, one last breath. "Tal." 

But...that was many years ago. Before the boy, before his pet. It was before the cities and the walls, the ships and armies. When Drak prowled the west without fear of human conquerers. 


I have to go do shit. Should I keep going and get to the actual "suspicious of why you don't age" part?
