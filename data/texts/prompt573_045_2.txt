He did his best not to laugh as Death walked in the room, looking all menacing. I mean, come on. Did he never grow out of the edgy teenager phase?

**"HELLO, DANIEL."** Death said.

"Yo, Reap-o." replied Daniel. "How's the job?"

**"PRETTY GOOD, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. GOT A RAISE LAST MONTH."** replied Death, not dropping the voice for a moment.

"That's good, thatâ€™s good. So what am I in for this time? Sorry if that's a faux pas or whatever."

**"NAH MAN, IT'S GOOD. I GET IT. HEART ATTACK, 2 MINUTES AGO."**

"Cool, cool. Same dealio? Coin flip?"

**"RIGHT. YEAH. ON WITH THE SHOW. CALL IT."** Death pulled a shiny coin from his pocket, black as obsidian, and tossed into the air with flourish.

"Tails."
The coin flew through the air, bounced off of Daniel's coffee table, flew over the mounds of dirty clothes, hit the dirty wall, and clattered to the floor.

**"OOF. HEADS AGAIN. WHAT'S THAT, THE SEVENTEENTH TIME IN A ROW?"**

"Yeah, yeah."

**"SORRY, MAN. I GOTTA REAP YOU. YOU'RE MORTAL. JUST PROTOCOL."**

"Don't screw with me, man. You know our deal."

**"I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I COULD LOSE MY JOB."**

"Death, I knew you in *college.*"

**"IT'S MY JOB, DUDE. I LOVE THIS JOB. YOU GOT NO IDEA HOW FUN IT IS TO REAP PEOPLE. I GOT ANTONIN SCALIA A WHILE AGO. HIGHLIGHT OF MY CAREER."**

"Dude, that was *you?* I had no idea."

**"YEAH. DUDE CALLED HEADS, THING LANDED ON ITS GODDAMN SIDE AND RESTED LIKE THAT. YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE LOOK ON HIS FACE."**

"Ha! Nice."

**"YEAH, I -- STOP CHANGING THE SUBJECT. YOU KNOW I HAVE TO REAP YOU."**

"*College,* Death. I knew you in *college.*"

Death sighed, put his scythe on Daniel's coat rack, and slumped into one of his armchairs.

**"ALRIGHT, JUST THIS ONCE. YOU'RE A SNEAKY BASTARD, YOU KNOW."**

"I do my best."

**"WHAT AGE THIS TIME? FIFTY THOUSAND? TWENTY THOUSAND?"**

"I'm gonna try for a fifteen minutes ago. See if I can get to the hospital."

**"HEY, GOOD LUCK, MAN. IF NOT, SEE YOU IN FIFTEEN MINUTES."**

"Alright. See ya."

Death disappeared with a very unfitting "shplangle."

Loki sighed and put his coffee down. Welp, time to start driving before that heart attack goes on.

"You know what? Being mortal has its perks."
