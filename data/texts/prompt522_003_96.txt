“Fuck! I parried that!” On the glowing window, a Japanese kanji appeared. Text in English underneath read;

#D E A T H

Two samurai began walking away from the body, only for the man to stand back up and slay them with his katana. The shadow watched in awe. How could a human stand back up after being cut and stabbed that many times? And in such condition that they might cut and stab another human to death? The shadow did not know. It had arrived to haunt the house and its inhabitants, but it found that the teenage boy had the strangest powers. The shadow had watched him trick people, trap people, and destroy people, whether they be an army or a single man. Once, the shadow had seen the man control a woman in a long coat, with a sword and a gun. A glowing red man in strange garb with a pyramid-shaped hat charged the woman, but the teenager used his contraption to slay the red man. The woman on the portal then raised her arms in a 90° angle, standing over the dead man’s corpse. 

The shadow watched in awe as the teenager controlled his warrior to enter a battlefield. Out came a massive horse carrying an even larger man who roared;  
“I am Gyoubu the Demon! As long as I breath, you will never pass the gate!” 

The man controlled by the teen was clearly outmatched, yet the shadow watched in awe as the man nimbly dodged and deflected the strikes with the massive spear. Eventually, the man leapt and struck Gyoubu in the neck, and eventually a second time. The demon died, and the teen stated;  
“Who’s the demon now, du Hurensohn?” The shadow could not answer the question, but it began to believe that the teenager was the true demon. There is no possible way that the shadow could ever live up to the things the teen had done.
