The first year was the hardest to endure.  When everything froze I had a panic attack that reduced me to convulsions on a closet floor.  I gathered blankets, pillows, and heavy objects like books, weights, and my stereo, with what little mental clarity I had.  After covering myself with everything, I waited for it to stop.  In hindsight it is kind of funny that I thought of the stop of time as a going-on, but this is an unnecessary point.  

I waited it out for what I thought must have been a couple of days.  This was when I was confronted with the problem of keeping time in a timeless world.  It was such a foreign concept, especially the sun remaining fixed in the sky, that I had to retreat to the closet and wait out the shocks every so often.  Eventually, my body fell into a rhythm and the cycles sleeping and waking were marked as days.  

It was after about 20 of these days that I noticed marks on my right forearm.  Whether they showed up all of a sudden or I was blind to them from my hysteria, it does not matter.  What does matter is that they spelled out “however long it takes save us.”  This naturally sent me back to my trusted closet for a few days.  

It took me 13 years to figure out what needed saving.  Apparently a rogue planet was about to hit the Earth and end all life here.  The government wasn’t going to tell anyone to avoid a panic.  If they were the ones who did this, which I haven’t found anything yet that points to that conclusion, they could’ve at least left some breadcrumbs behind to help. 

Anyways, this is the very abridged beginning of the written account of my activity.  I figured writing would be a great birthday gift to myself.  Hopefully this year, lucky 136, will bring me closer to an answer.
