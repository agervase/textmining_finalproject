"Hail Lord Indra!” “Hail Lord Indra!" the chants woke him up from outside his house, as every morning since *'The Travel'*. They now even gave his mistake of a lifetime a name. *'The Travel'* he would scoff. *The Fools*, he would call them if he were to name his followers. Every morning he would go down a spiral of questions asking himself over and over, *how could I have not seen this? What was I thinking going back in time to kill every religious idiot? How did I NOT see this coming!* He had not spared anyone when he traveled back in time, men, women and children. Thought of god *is* evil, and to destroy evil, every thought of god must die with its bearer.

Indra was discreet as much as possible about the killings, he had poisoned the Pope’s wine and planted a dagger in the Prophet in his sleep. But he had little options when the Hindus gathered for their *Kumbh Mela*, or when the Muslims pilgrims travelled long and far for *Arba’een*. *Every thought of god has to die*, he would often find repeating himself as he laid thousands and thousands of c-4s. Little did Indra realize what he done there, in front of those millions of miracle awaiting eyes, awestruck and mystified by his sudden appearance and the great balls of fire and blinding light emerging around them.

*Now* he did. But it was too late, *he* had become their God! *How could I have not seen this!?* For centuries now “Hail Lord Indra!” was on everyone’s lips. Temples and shrines were built in his name and people still donated huge amounts to the church so that *Lord Indra will absolve all our sins*. But he was now sick of it, he couldn’t bear the thought of him being God anymore. Now he was the *evil*. Indra resolved to put an end to this once and for all. He had climbed to the edge of his roof still in his pyjamas. The people had fell silent, eager to hear their god’s voice. “Tell me, does a God die!” he roared and jumped to his death. A loud gasp rose from the gathered crowd. Blood splattered everywhere and a body lay plastered to the ground. The people could not believe what had just happened in front of their eyes.

*The Sacrifice*, they had called it.
