"We were wrong. Planet inhabited. Do not send rescue."

Tom sent the message, his hand lingering on the button a moment as he watched the transmission status. "That's it, then. I'll never see home again."

>but you are home

Tom nodded to the empty air, limping on his injured leg as he left the communications hub. He held the wound on his side, blood seeping through his fingers. Mullins... damn him. Got the jump on him.

Tom took a moment to kick Mullin's lifeless corpse as he shuffled out of the comm room. The hallway outside was littered with detritus. Plaster and metal from damaged walls. Shards of plastene from shattered windows. The shimmer of emergency force fields the only thing standing between Tom and the crimson expanse of the Martian landscape outside.

>is it not beautiful tom

He could only nod, clenching his teeth against the pain in his side and in his leg. The temperature was dropping. Wafts of steam rose from the still-warm bodies of Henderson, Guttierez, Smythe-Barnes, Nokimura, and Mikhailov. Their shells littered the hall, sprays of blood adorning the nearby walls. Smythe-Barnes had been divorced from her legs. Tom couldn't remember where he had left them, but watching her crawl for help had been...

>delightful

No. It had been horrible. Monsterous. But also, worthwhile. "All for you." Tom whispered.

>yes tom  
>  
>come to me now my love

Tom turned to the shimmering force field patching the hole in the station. It was built to hold back the vacuum of thin atmosphere, but a human could push through it easily. Normally this would be done to effect repairs, but today...

Tom picked up the helmet of a nearby exosuit. Affixed the seals, checked the air supply. One hour of oxygen. More than he needed. She was close. So close her whispers tickled his ear.

>come to me tom  
>  
>we will be together forever

Tom slipped through the force field, and shuffled across the arid red valleys of Mars.
