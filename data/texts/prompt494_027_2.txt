This is my first post in this subreddits, so apologies if it doesn’t turn out perfect, I’m also typing on a phone. Thanks!




“*The swing of my scythe is like the wind, it’s a cold and calculated force in this plane*.”

The Reaper coughed before taking another breath to continue,
“**You see**, no mortal is quite like you, and I’ve been waiting for the day we finally meet in spirit. Do you remember the night of January 5th of 2005?”


“No.”

But I did. And I had been trying to push that night as deep down into my memories as my mortal brain would let me. It never quite seemed to work.

I was raised to be hopeful, to be a good Christian, it was “WWJD” that I used to shout. Ever since my birth I was brainwashed into thinking of the afterlife as a ‘cookie cutter’ paradise, where there’s a Caucasian man on a golden throne. And maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong. Either way destiny decided a long time ago that it wasn’t for me to find out.


“1 in 4.” the doctor continued, “Basically 25% of the world’s population suffers from Dysautonomia, but cases like yours? In just Dysautonomia diagnosed patients? 1 in 100 million. So statistically, out of 4 billion people, there’s only 10 with your diagnosis.”



These words echoed in my brain until I could hear their reverb in the void I’m currently standing in. 
One^In^Four^One^In^Four

“We can tell you are lying.... one would think that’s not a smart thing to do in this plane. We saw, we remember, and we welcome you with open arms. It was our birthdate too.”


Legally speaking while I was alive I had been pronounced dead 3 times. I had passed out more times than I can count, and had more seizures than I did cousins. On two occasions I came to this same void I’m in now, but on those nights there wasn’t the Reaper that is now standing before me.


I was 5 years old when I spent the first night in the void. It was a calculated type of cold, the feeling you get from floating on top of water or from a cool wind. It was.... relaxing. I felt at peace in this void, it was calling my name and for some reason I knew my name was supposed to be there. The French call it *’L’appel du vide*’ or ‘The Call of The Void’, but it felt stronger than that.


“When mortals die they have two choices, restart, or take a risk on the end.”


Because of where my diagnosis had led me, I became fixated on Death. As a human I never trusted a single religion’s depiction of Death. It was a universal thing, how could there be just one set definition of such a large force in this plane? There’s only so many tools in our tool shed right? Someone or something else has more tools than us somewhere right? And I was.

“Taking a risk on the end is normally what most choose, and by most we speak of the unwise. If one is so unwise to choose the end, then they get the very privilege the creator has. A deep depressing solitude. The unwise can imagine any world to the point, but it is never enough to satisfy their hunger for the ‘real’. If you were able to choose the end, you would soon realize that your loved ones there with you, are just constructs of your thoughts. Machines powered by your own willpower, whether it’s subconscious or not. It’s like being in a dream that you know is fake, but everyone else there doesn’t. In the end it drives every single person **mad**.”


The Reaper paused.

“The restarters face a different challenge however, instead of becoming mirror images of the creator, they pick the restart in hopes of keeping all their prior knowledge. And that’s where it gets fishy, because in this void, there are no promises, no courts of law, and definitely no handshakes. They think life will be easier with a second chance. They think that success, love, and happiness will come easier this second go around. You should see the looks on their mortal faces when they realize their memory is wiped. It’s a special type of humor only for us to enjoy.”


I got sick to my stomach, or at least where it would be.


“But just like that plane, in this one there are also jobs.”


I couldn’t understand what the Reaper mean’t, but it’s words started to feel familiar.


“Think of it as winning the only lottery that truly matters. Or what some mortals might call a blessing, maybe even a curse.”

Ten^Out^of^four^billion

“Every thousand years or so there’s a shift change at this cursed and blessed place. New recruits like you come and relieve the old timers, 1000 years later, rinse repeat.”


“Wait, wha-? A shift change? This is um, this is-“

The Reaper cut me off.

“A lot. We know, it was a lot for us to grasp too.”

“And why do you keep saying we?”

“*Turn around*.” The Reapers voice was becoming more and more quiet as I was here, until it was a whisper.

I whipped my skull 180 degrees, unwillingly, and my eyes met a mirror. A shape shifting one. A mirror that had both my face and others reflecting off of it. 10 faces to be exact. A ethereal bony finger outstretched itself from behind and pointed towards our face. 

“*You are me*. *And I am you*.”

The Reaper handed me the scythe, and with a grip of the handle the Reaper disappeared. I looked down at my hands, which had now become the Reapers. I stared back into the mirror and said loudly,


***“We don’t think we’ll ever get used to this.”***
