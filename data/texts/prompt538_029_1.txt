Tessa skidded a crossed the concrete and toward the coffee shop where her best friend Shade would have a drink. 

Meanwhile, with Shade, a tall nice young man blinks curiously. 

"Yo, Hugh, you good?" Shade asks, saving his hand in front if Shane's face. 

"Never better." Hugh chirps, his English accent thick and soothing. 

Shade was never a gay man, but good Lord if he ever crossed to the other side. Of course, Shade knew that wouldn't play out. 

"I must say, I should probably get going. I don't have long here." Hugh drops a dollar beside Shade's drink and excuses himself. 

Tessa is wheezing and fumbles for her inhaler desperately. She's only a few meters away. Her paces and footsteps becoming sloppy and clumsy. 

Hugh steps outside of the shop and freezes with an elegant gasp. Quite the contrast of Tessa's horrible fall and choked gasp. 

Hugh watches his vision fall to the ground, and stumbles despite not moving. Feeling like he fell himself. Tessa sees a red sedan and a little girl run by in her sight. She catches herself but not before hearing that dreaded crack. 

A flash of white and Tessa lifts her hand to reveal cuts and scrapes from her now broken inhaler. She wheezes heavily and stands, limping and hobbling the rest of her journey. Hugh coughs for air and looks around curiously. Down the sidewalk, he sees a young woman struggling and walking like a zombie. The vision flashes again but instead, he sees himself looking at himself?? Tessa sees the same thing and looks up more to meet Hugh's? Her eyes? 

The flashes of white again and Hugh and Tessa break off in a spring to war each other, Tessa only making it halfway before collapsing. Hugh crouches beside her and calls out to her. 

"Miss? Are you alright????"

"My..... [Wheeze] inhaler..... [Coughing] broookkke....." Tessa had mixed a cough and wheeze for the last word. 

Hugh lifts her and starts calling for help.
