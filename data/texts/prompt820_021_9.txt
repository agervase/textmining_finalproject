"Carl." It whispered. The voice was definitely H Jon Benjamin.

"Carl, over here, it's me, celebrity actor H. Jon Benjamin." It said more plainly.

"Now none of your cheat, Jon." The warrior said, not taking his shit.

"...You're right. I'm sorry. Celebrity *voice* actor, H. Jon Benjamin."

It emanated from a shillelagh, an old one, maybe 50ish. It lay in a corner, a fine layer of dust on its handle.

"Look, Jon. It's nothing personal, I think I'm just gonna keep looking."

"No, wait. Dude." Down the hall one could hear another, wise and ancient sounding weapon calling to the warrior. "Ignore that guy, he sucks too."

"Yeah, but I want to be taken seriously, and he looks like a cool sword of some-"
"I will not stop until I get you laid." The shillelagh said, desperate.

The warrior had to stop and reassess. Down the hall the fancy glowing sword was calling, louder now. "Shh! Shut up over there just a second! Sorry, repeat that last thing?"

"Look, I am awesome at parties. Sparkles Mcgee over there will give you the power and stuff, whoopdee doo right? You wanna look cool and kill a bunch of evil all the time, or do you want to *be cool* all the time, go to ye old tavern with me and walk out with floozies under each arm?"

"Well... I mean, the evil ones did kill my father..."

"There is no dad ever lived that would be disappointed in his son honoring his death walking out of a bar with floozies under each arm."

"..."

"You'll also notice my handle is *very smooth*. *Very*. No slivers up in there. I don't know what you're into... but I don't judge. All I'm saying is that I'm multipurpose. I'm a club, I swing both ways. So, what do you say?"

"...Deal."

"YES. Alright! Ah, that's what I'm talking about. I am outta this joint! Now, uh, I don't wanna kiss and tell, but you should get some paper towels, maybe some pledge, my last user was... thorough."
