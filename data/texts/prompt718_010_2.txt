Two young men, one is a Marine Sniper, the other a freelance and extreme hobbyist photographer. The Sniper and the Photographer are brothers. Even from the beginning of their lives they knew what they wanted to be, and each had an affinity for shooting. The Sniper went to school on a basketball scholarship and was great at billiards. The Photographer went to a trade school and was an amazing striker on his soccer team. 

One day the Photographer comes home from work to find his brother's car in the driveway. Excited to see his brother for the first time in three months, The Photographer immediately hugs his brother, and the two go out for a drink. 

At the bar, the bartender asks them what they'll have. "Two shots of Vodka and two buds please," The Sniper says. 

"Shots, eh?" The bartender asks. "Tell me. You two look like you know a thing er two about shooting. Marine dress fatigues, hipster clothes and a camera? How do you line up your shots?"

"It's quite simple for me really. Make sure you're in the right spot with a good vantage point, look through the scope, and snap." The Sniper accentuates 'snap' with a snap of his fingers. "Afterwards, all you feel is satisfaction of a job well done."

The bartender looks at The Sniper, and nods his head. "So let me ask you what you do to line up the shot?" 

The Photographer takes a swig of his beer, and says "It's quite simple for me really. Make sure you're in the right spot with a good vantage point, look through the viewfinder, and snap." The Photographer accentuates the 'snap' with a snap of his own fingers.

"That simple?" the bartender asks.

"That simple." The Sniper and The Photographer reply. 

"You two brothers?" the bartender asks.

"Identical, but oh so different," The Sniper says.

"I thought so." the bartender says. And the bartender walks off and lets the two brothers enjoy each-other's company.

Sorry if this story is bad. Didn't outline anything and I'm not very good, lol.
