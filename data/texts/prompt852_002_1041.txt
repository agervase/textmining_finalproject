Legality and morality are not always compatible.

That's what I learned in the years following my defeat. *Our* defeat.

I remember the days when the world was simple to me, everything was black and white.

Then **he** appeared, and everything changed.

We thought ourselves invincible, with Truth and Justice on our side.

He did the impossible, felling us one by one. To those he defeated, he offered a choice. Join him, or lose their power. Lose your soul or suffer a fate worse than death.

At first, most chose their souls.

That didn't last long.

Cornered and with nowhere to turn but each other, we forged an alliance born of desperation.

Looking back, that, too, was part of his plan. He anticipated our every move, and acted accordingly.

We never stood a chance.

After my...*our* defeat, he acted swiftly to legitimize his political power. The only vote that mattered was for his house of delegates, who all answered to him.

And then he started changing things.

We always knew suffrage to be wrong, but he gave women the vote. Then, he started introducing them into political office.

We watched, horrified, as he allowed the other races access to an education and jobs. He even allowed them to buy and own their own property.

We could do nothing to stop him diverting funding from defense into  education and scientific research in medicine and technology. Within a decade, being paralysed was no longer a sentence, but a treatable condition.

Even those who had opposed him at first, whose powers he had quelled, were offered treatment.

Defeated as I am, I hid my face from the truth for so long. But no longer.

We were the villains.
