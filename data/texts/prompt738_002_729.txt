It had been about a year since Fred started coming around the gang, but try as we might we just couldn't seem to get rid of him. He was homeless, but he was very friendly and didn't ask us for anything. Even if we did give him some money, that we had stolen, he'd hang around and talk with us. After awhile, we just got used to him being with us because it was a nice change of pace.

He was a vet who had served decades ago, so that struck a cord with some of us when we found out, as some of us have served before. Eventually, all of us had gotten to know him better, what kind of person he was and why he was out on the streets.

We never did have the heart to tell him what kind of people we were. We didn't want to disappoint him.

One day, he had come in with a dog; that we all instantly recognized as his golden lab, Bud; with blood seeping from a bullet wound in the dog's side. Fred didn't look much better either, a black eye and a busted lip accompanied with bloodied knuckles told us that he had been in a fight recently.

All of us scrambled around, grabbing blankets, rubbing alcohol, anything to try and help them both. Unfortunately, our efforts were in vain as the dog passed away in his owner's arms.

None of us said anything for the longest time, and when one of us did, Jonathan was the first to speak. "Fred, did you know who did this...?" He asked, kneeling in front of the man we had known for months.

Fred swallowed thickly, tears in his eyes. "It...it was a group of men, near the park..." he said, looking down at his long time friend, who had just been forcefully ripped from this world.

"What were they wearing?" I asked, crouching down in front of him. "Blue, all I saw was blue....all of them were wearing it..." Fred said softly, petting the dog's head.

"We'll make sure he gets justice." I said, putting my hand on the old man's shoulder, giving it a firm squeeze. I stood up and signalled for my men to get ready. We were going to war.
