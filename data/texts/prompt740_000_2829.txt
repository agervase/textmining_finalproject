Rebecca pushed around the vegetables on her plate mindlessly with her fork. She hated how good the food was here, how much better it tasted than their rations. It just didn't feel right somehow.

"Hey," The girl taking a seat across from Rebecca exclaimed, startling her slightly. "Haven't seen ya round here before. D'ja come on the new ship?" 

Rebecca stared at her for a second before nodding in the affirmative and going back to poking around in her food.

"Oh, where'r my manners," The girl said, immediately breaking the silence again. "name's Zahara, of the RNS Indigo. Pleased to meetcha"

Stretching out her heavily tanned arm for a handshake, Rebecca resigned herself to the conversation and shook it begrudgingly. 

"Rebecca, IW Crusader." Struggling to suppress a sigh, she continued. "A pleasure." 

Smiling from ear to ear, Zahara happily continued. 

"Classy. So, Rebecca, what's your deal? Like, occupation-wise n such? Hobbies maybe?" 

"I am-," Biting her lip slightly to focus herself, she continued. "I was supposed to be head of agriculture, but clearly that's been taken care of already." She said, picking up a particularly angular root vegetable with her fork. 

"No shit, you're into farming and that sorta stuff?" Zahara said excitedly. "I grow like half of the veggies on your plate." 

At this, Rebecca raised a curious eyebrow. "Wait, you own a farm?"

"Well, not really own," Zahara said in the middle of chewing her food. "Me dad was our agricultural expert and when he died I just sorta took care of the farms we had. It's mostly automated anyway, so a lot of the work's theoretical anyway" 

"You have an automated system in place?" Looking down at her plate briefly, Rebecca felt her curiosity slowly overpower her disdain. "Can I see it?" 

"You bet," Zahara said, beaming up again. "But let me just ask you one thing." She paused, looking her right in her eyes. "Was the sky actually as blue as they say?"
