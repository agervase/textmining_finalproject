“This isn’t what I signed up for!! This isn’t what I signed up for!!!!” 

Paul screamed. Silence returned. Nothing was here. The granular feeling underneath his hands. He gripped the earth below him. Tears streamed down his face cutting through the dust. 

“Alan!!!! Where are you?!!!!” More silence. 

He struggled around on the ground looking for something. Trying to find his brother. Trying to find him. He knew he was close but what direction. He spun. Hands stretched out. Knees still in the sand. Finally. The feeling of a leg. 

“Alan!” Silence. The metallic smell in the air meant only one thing. Blood. 

It must have been everywhere. Paul frantically searched his brother for a wound. There. There it was. The neck. The side of the neck. The weight of the situation pulled him down to his brothers chest as he screamed in agony. A new pain he’d never felt before. 

That was it. That explained the silence. He was dead. His first friend. His only brother. Dead by his own hand. He laid on his chest and sobbed for what seemed like days. 

Finally a voice rang out and cut the silence. 

“Well and there you have it folks! Paul’s not really up for talking right now so let’s get his sight restored and get him on his way.” 

Paul regained his vision. Seeing the host smiling after what had just happened sent him into a rage. He charged the host but was quickly brought down. 

“Ooooohhhhh come on now Paul! It’s just a game! And you’ve won! Here’s your 20,000$ and the key to your very own brand new CAR!!!! Come on everyone big round of applause for Paul here.” 

“It wasn’t supposed to kill him!!!! You lied to me!!!!” Paul screamed. 

“Hey there! You signed the waiver. We never know what’s really going to happen but you’ve won! Big smile for the camera Paul! We’ll be right back with Family Feud after a brief message from our sponsors.”
