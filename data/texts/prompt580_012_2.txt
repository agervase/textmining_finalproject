Hey guys. Hoping this will be okay. I've got a multi-post story here.

Edits: A couple spelling errors that hindered flow.

Uncle Bill was always just Bill to me.

&#x200B;

I lived there, think about it.

&#x200B;

Everyone else gets "Dad" or "Mom", or something else equally short. So I called Uncle Bill, "Bill" from about the time that any reasonable child stops using the moniker "Daddy" or "Momma".

&#x200B;

Bill's house was undeniably different than anyone else's house that I knew. It was always cluttered, there really wasn't a single horizontal space that didn't have at least a medium-sized pile of items.

I would go visit my other aunts and uncles, these were the ones that you called "Uncle" Fred or "Aunt" Mabel, and I would stare in horror at the knick-knack shelves as the glass swans and pewter poodles stared back at me. Each dark eye filling me with a vague sense of unease.  My uncles would show off their cars or golf clubs and I would nod politely while attempting to suppress the faint look of horror starting around my eyes. They knew I wasn't at all interested in the hunting equipment and thankfully, none of the new acquisitions were paraded in front of me. They though it specially strange in light that I devoured the literature on their operation and the science of ballistics. The absolute worst were the pudgy caricatures known as Hummel figurines. Their slightly bloated faces, pale skin, and overly-rouged cheeks reminded me too much of bodies I'd seen in a funeral once when I was younger. My Great Aunt Jill kept several of these strange items on display in her sewing room. I could never fathom why and would walk swiftly by the door, willing myself to focus on the blank wall opposite the door. I thought it even more tragic because she produced such wonderful quilts and dresses for my cousins. She seemed to sense my unease, and if I stayed over for more than a day she would sometimes take her sewing to the kitchen table on a smaller antique sewing machine that was worked by foot-pedal. This happened a few times a year when Bill would get suddenly called away "on-business".

While there, we would warm up with the usual small talk, school, which sports I was in, or if I still had a crush on so-and-so? We would talk about the weather, which was bizarrely fun because she could tell you almost exactly what the weather had been on that day, or almost every other day, for last 40 years. Eventually, these topics exhausted, the conversation would turn to family history. And here, I would usually sit silent for several hours, while stories of our ancestors, 20 generations past flowed from her, timed by the cadence of her foot on the treadle of the sewing machine. She always claimed the stories as truth, having been "writ in her brain as if by God's own pen," she would tell me. Most of the stories had come from her own grandmother, Grandma Wojcik, though Aunt Jill could recall having learned some from two older relatives, the twin uncles of Grandma Wojcik, when they were very old and she was very young. When she tired of stories and I could not prod her to continue, sometimes she would stop sewing and ask me to examine the machine. "It is such a simple, yet important, device," she would tell me. "See!" she would exclaim "It spins of my own power, and how many moving parts does it have?"

&#x200B;

Bill's house wasn't dirty, I mean, it didn't stink, but it wasn't clean. It was cluttered, to put it politely. A "right-tilting dis-array" he would mutter under his breath when I was younger. The "tilting" giving way to the much more vulgar and accurate "fucking" when I was deemed mature enough to hear that sort of language. On the rare occasion that any of Bill's brothers and sisters, or my aunts and uncles from my father's side of the family dropped by, they usually didn't stay long. Often just enough time to drop off a birthday card, gently fattened with "guilt" saw-bucks, on account of "not having seen me in so long". I could tell that the extra bill or two was because they were appalled at the conditions of Bill's and my quarters. Sometimes, if the weather was good, a couple of Bill's brothers would bring a cooler of beer and some food to grill. A small hibachi would be produced and we would throw a frisbee or play horse-shoes for a couple hours. Then I would go to bed and Bill and Uncle Steve and Uncle Herbert would talk until well past dark.

Eventually, I grew up and left Bill's house for college. I loved coming back home. Nothing beat leaving the manufactured experience of a large college town and loosing myself in the piles of accumulated items. Breathing in the dust, steadying teetering towers with a hand or foot, while sifting for something I hadn't seen yet. The last part, finding something new wasn't difficult. Because what everyone missed, was the fact that the items in the house changed fairly regularly. To be fair, amongst the thousands of items in his house even I would sometimes miss a new pile forming behind a familiar one. Or the presence of an old pile, stepped over a thousand times, suddenly gone.

Shortly after graduating college and starting my first real job, Bill called me at my desk. Surprising as I was almost never at my desk, he was flustered and excited in a way that I had never heard before. He needed me to come over "...as soon as you possibly can!" "matter of grave importance...," "..most bizarre!" I could hear his voice fading and growing as his head turned away and back towards the handset of his old rotary phone.
