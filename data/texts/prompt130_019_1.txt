  

Sorry if the ending is a bit lackluster, but I could think of a very satisfying conclusion, so I cut it off early instead.

===========================================================================

"Alright, alright, you got me."

Daniel stood static. His breath stopped, every cell in his body froze and his face displayed a messy amalgamation of shock, fear and disbelief as his teddy bear stood in front of him.

"How the hell'd you figure me out after all this time? 18 years and I'm just hearin' this now?" The bear winced slightly as it ran a fingerless paw over the back of its head, apparently hurt from the impact it had just made against the wall. Daniel, for his part, was still collecting fragments of his reality that had just been shattered by what was currently transpiring.

Another five seconds gave him his breath back, but not his speech.

"This is-... I don... You... I" A mess of letters dribbled from his mouth before he finally formed a complete sentence. "What the fuck are you!? What the fuck is this!? What the...! Just.. What the fuck!?" He half shrieked, half whispered the tirade of questions, not wanting to alert the rest of the household, and he pointed unsteadily at the furry figure.

"Eh?" The teddy, it seemed, was just as confused as Daniel. "Why're you askin' me when you just said it yourself?" The bear rose to its feet and stomped to Daniel with a less than friendly demeanour, causing the youth to back away as if an actual Grizzly Bear were closing in on him, rather than the 1-foot children's toy making its way to his bed. "I'm the goddamn Devil, kid" he growled.

Daniel felt trapped, yet somehow hearing those words calmed him somewhat. Perhaps it was the contrast between the hellish imagery the word "devil" evoked and the frankly adorable plush toy mean mugging him, but a handful of his fear gave way to scepticism instead. 

"Oh, r-really? Th-then why's the devil look like a little stuffed toy, huh? Why not some scary looking monster with goat horns and batwings?"

The bear scoffed at that and proceeded to grab Daniel's ankle. After a single frame of darkness, like an involuntary blink, Daniel's reality was torn and mangled from that of his room to a hellish landscape of brimstone and fire. He screamed as almost exactly what he had described lifted him by his ankle with a terrible, clawed grip and forced him to look into a pair of evil, yellow eyes. "This more to your liking, Danny Boy?" the devil bellowed with a venomous smirk.

Daniel was quite upset. "NONOI'MSORRRYPLEASEJUSTTAKEMEBACKTAKEMEBACK PLEAAAAASE...!!!" Daniel shrieked, drowning in the nightmare he now found himself in. The devil cackled as he slowly loosened his grip, and as soon as Daniel dropped-

He was back. After another black frame, he drew a panicked breath as he looked around him, seeing nothing but the regularity of his room and the Teddy Bear shaking in laughter at his feet.

"Bwahahaha!! Priceless! Absolutely priceless!" Daniel was back to how he started. Terrified, agitated and confused. "Haha... Alright-haha...! Ah... Alright, alright, I'll explain" The bear let its smile fade before speaking.

"Allow me to introduce myself properly. I go by a lotta names; Satan, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, or, like I said, the Devil. Real names Lucifer, but call me whateva you want. Honestly, I don't fuckin' care." Daniel didn't say a word, staying completely still whilst hugging his back to the wall. "Now, I'm sure you're probably confused as to why I look like some cheap... Er, very EXPENSIVE carnival prize, and am standing in front of you. Right?" Daniel stayed silent, giving only a faint nod in response.

"Well, hell's a pretty big place, and aside from the eternal torture and anguish I get to dish out to the poor saps down there-which I love by the way- it can get kinda boring after a while. SO, rather than spend all my time down there, I'll occasionally take the jump up to earth and see what poor schmuck I can torment here instead. Only problem is, my regular hellish form which you just had the good fortune of seeing can't materialise up here, so I gotta possess a physical object instead. Hence, Devil Teddy Bear" Daniel looked mortified as cold realisation nestled in his stomach.

“So” the bear followed. “Any questions?”
