"That was MY lunch! Put me down, Ig!" She yells, pounding the claws holding her aloft. Unlike Prin, her fluffy white cat, this dragon never listened. Okay, who was she kidding, Prin didn't listen either. 

She felt the air pounding by her in waves as the blue dragon pumped its wings. A rise and dip, rise and dip. It used to scare her, those dips especially, but she knew just a few more and they'd be atop the heights. 

She looked up at the smug reptile as it winged upwards. It's dark blue scales shimmered in the shadows of the cliff above. And as they reached the top scintillating rainbows erupted on the navy hide. The dragon's swirling left eye looked down at her as she drifted towards a landing on the top of the cliff.

A dainty dip as the claws grazed the ground enough to drop her off and then she was buffeted by the dragon's landing gusts. As the graceful landing turned into the not so graceful curling around the girl. It was like watching a dog get in just the right spot for petting. But this giant dog was too excited, and it showed.

"Didn't you hear me, you big lump. I wasn't done with my lunch." The girl repeated pointing back down into the bowl of the mountain. 

The dragon opened a swirling eye to look at the girl and gave one snort, exhaling a tendril of steam in the process. It then closed its eye, waited a moment, then used its tail to push the girl over to its frills and ears for scratchings. The girl's boot heels left ruts in the gravel as she went. But she laughed, giving the huge neck in front of her a hug, before she gave in and scratched behind its ear.
