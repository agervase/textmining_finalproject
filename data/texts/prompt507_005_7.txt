Just for the night, H-143 reminded Rachel. She required a small upgrade. Lots of families requested upgrades overnight, so as not to disturb their daytime schedules. So robots would leave after bedtime, walk to base, and return before the family woke up. 

“I should be back by…” H-143 checked her internal clock, “3am, maybe?”

Rachel could see that an upgrade was required when H-143 left her bedroom out the window, not the door, and left it ajar. That wasn't standard programming. She brushed off the thought and curled up in bed, idly listening to the gentle footfalls travelling away from the building. 

H-143 had been Rachel's birthday present, nearly 11 years previously. Her parents chose a design with brown hair and deep chocolate eyes, much like Rachel's. Physically, they could pass for sisters. 

Over the years, they'd grown together, in a way; as Rachel matured day by day, H-143 (or Heidi, as they started to call her) would go away once every few months and return expanded in the relevant dimensions as she matured.

After Rachel's second tantrum, her mother requested that the company stop sending Heidi back taller than Rachel. 

Lying in bed, Rachel heard her bedroom door open, a sliver of light cutting through the far wall. Gentle breathing, and the door closed. Apparently she was never too old for her mum to check she was sleeping, the top of her head just poking out of the covers. 

She kept an eye on the window, not able to drift to sleep. After a time she managed something like it, a hazy semi-consciousness where time became unimportant. 

It was gone 4:30 when Heidi came back, clambering clumsily through the window. Rachel sat bolt upright in the dark. 

“What's wrong with the *door*?” she whispered. 

“Hussshhh.” Heidi stumbled towards the bed, and put a finger to her lips with a smile. She missed.”Hu-shushes. You'll wake everyone up.”

“Maybe I should. Your upgrades must've gone all wrong.” Rachel sniffed. The air stank of alcohol - how much of a clean had Heidi's systems needed?

“Tha's funny. I got my upgrades.” Heidi winked, “OK, you can get out of bed now. ‘m tired.”

“Heidi…”

Heidi stopped fumbling for the covers in the dark, and squinted up at Rachel, “You're not great at jokes. You can stop it now. And drop my voice, it's creepy.”

“How about *you* stop imitating *my* voice?” 

The two stared frozen at one another.

“Oh, shit.” Heidi mumbled aloud. Mascara was smeared like she'd been rubbing her eyes. 

“What?” 

“You think you're me.”

“Don't be stupid,” Rachel scoffed, “I think *I'm* me.”

“Look, this got out of hand,” Heidi said softly, “you've gone all weird in the wires. *I* am Rachel.”

“*I* am Rachel,” she echoed.

“Oh, *hell.* Dad's gonna flip. Look, you're not Rachel you're - lemme show you.”

She felt her way to a chest of drawers, pulling out an old brownies penknife from the bottom drawer. 

She held up her hand. Flipped out the knife. Slid it over her finger. When the dull blade didn't do anything, she muttered a complaint and rummaged around the floor for a safety pin. She pressed it into her finger and quickly yelped, shaking the hand vigorously. Held it out in front of her, showing one drop. One tiny drop of dark red liquid. 

Rachel inhaled. 

“You… You're not supposed to bleed.”

“No shit, Sherlock. And you don't, look.” Heidi reached out, grabbing the penknife with her free hand. Carelessly. Dangerously. 

*“You're a real sport, Heidi-hi,” Rachel murmured, leaning over the mirror to finish her lipstick. The shade didn't suit her, but she preferred not to be told that.* 

*“I don't really think I understa-”*

*“Look,” Rachel whispered, dropping the lipstick on the bedspread and taking Heidi by the shoulders, “‘Heidi’* *is sneaking out. For ‘upgrades’ and shit. ‘Rachel’ is staying here to sleep like a good girl. That's all you need to do.”*

*A warning beep had started to sound in Heidi's head. She was late for upgrade.* 

*“I'm not-”* 

*“Just lie down, and don't get up until I get back. If mum tries to talk to you just keep the covers over your face. Do that voice thing. ‘Mum, I'm tired.’ Is that enough of a sample?”*

*Missing an upgrade wasn't good. It was like a human missing sleep. It could do funky things to her programming.* 

*“Yes, I can copy that, but -”* 

*“Repeat after me, OK? ‘I am Rachel’.”*

*“I am Rachel?”* 

*“‘I am human.’”*

*“‘I am… human.’”*

*“‘I am Rachel.’”*

*Everything went… staticky.* 

*“I am Rachel,” said Heidi, perfectly parsed, with full conviction.* 

*“Great. I should be back by… 3am, maybe?” Rachel climbed out thee bedroom window.* 

Knife in one hand, pin in the other. One girl pulled the other off the bed in the dark, trying to jab aimlessly, just to show she didn't bleed. One girl trying to pull the blade from her hand before she did something stupid. A scuffle, a slip, a sharp inhale. 

The light went on. One girl lay on the floor, eyes in contorted, permanent surprise. One stood, and held up shaking, bloody hands to the light. A defensive cut to her arm shone silver. Metal underneath. 

“But… I am Rachel,” Heidi whimpered.
