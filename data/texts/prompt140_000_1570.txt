Interesting,  I never really look under my desk.  I don't really have time.  I have to keep track of the hourglasses that line the walls and go up and down the tables in my office.  

To call it an office might be putting it a little gently.  You see its more like a warehouse, that is if the warehouse were 17 football fields long and filled with tables, shelves as far as the eye can see, each table meticulously covered by tiny hourglasses that represent the time remaining in someones life.  I'm note exactly sure how my counterpart Life does it, but each one is the same size, about 2 inches tall but they can still take decades or in some cases over a hundred years to run out.   When they run out, I collect the soul of the person who it represents.

However, apparently I missed someone. Or maybe I didn't, its impossible to know for sure.  This dust covered hour glass is on its side.  The sands of life have stopped running for it.  

As I examine it I see the date of birth on it is 1922, which is not bad they could conceivably still be alive so this could be worse. 

You know what, a few more years isn't that bad of a thing, this could be a record breaker when its all said and done and thats not a bad thing.  If I just turn it upright, its got about half of its grains left to run.  So we'll let them run, why not?  Besides who's to say that this person can't do some good up there in the next 40 or so years?  

As I set the hourglass up on the table I can't help but wish this person luck, they've obviously had it up until this point and I hope they continue to have it for the rest of their time.  

Good Luck, Betty White.
