"Go!" I commanded as I held up my sword, mentally preparing for my demise to guarantee enough time for my queen to escape. Hoards of enemies appeared on the horizon and quickly charged down as the rest of us began our retreat.

"Captain..." I shook my head. They knew that no amount of words will turn me back from my decision. They knew how stubborn I am.

"Make sure she lives..." I gave my second-in-command a bittersweet grin and with that, he nodded and departed. I stood at the designated choke point, where enemies could only come in few. I muttered a short prayer before engaging in combat.

Like a lone wolf fighting hoards of endless enemies, I hope that my death would at least serve somewhat of a purpose. A heroic death.

*The world...has greatly changed...since my death...*

*I've seen... the world transform... from villages... to small towns... to giant cities...*

*I've seen war... the endless cycle... of humanity... Oh how ironic it is... for us to fight... rather than... cooperate...*

*I still ponder... at my semi-existence... why am I still here?... Is this... what afterlife... looks like...?*

*I doubt it... There's no one... but me and others... living beings... who are completely... unaware of me...*

*Many things I can do... Defies natural laws... go through physical beings... float and watch... like a spectator watching... the beautiful world... slowly and finally...  working together...*

Fellow men, the Empire dates back to the one man who saved us all. His bravery. His courage. His noble sacrifice is what continue us to this day. Let us learn from him.

Yes sir!

Alright children, gather around. Here's a story about a legendary swordsman who risks his life for the greater good. 

Oh! I love that story. My grandfather tells me that one all the time. I love it!

Now now Jack, let's not spoil it for others.

"Haven't you heard, man?" Joe said as he kept drinking, now completely wasted, "That infamous legend of the warrior that managed to keep his queen alive by sacrificing himself. I aspire to be like that for Maddie."

"Shhh... You have too much to drink tonight. You and your love for history. You wouldn't want to do that for that crazy ex of yours."

-------

*Ah... Maybe it's not that bad... I hope I get to see... how much humanity... progresses into... the better future.*
