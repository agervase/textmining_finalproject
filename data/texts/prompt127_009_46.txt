I always knew, since I was a baby. If I’ll be a good boy, then my blood will be white.
I was always scared of having black blood.

I must be a good boy.

Around this simple principle, I built my life.  And it felt good helping others. I was happy!

I studied medicine because I thought no greater good exists but saving a life. 
During my years in university, I tried to be as helpful for my colleagues as possible. I helped everyone who would ask for it, even at the risk of being slowed down. Usually my kindness was one-way, but I didn’t care. I was happy while helping others, and all the rest didn’t matter.

After finishing my studies, I became one of the most famous and talented surgeon in the whole country.
By the age of 55, I had lost count of the people I saved.

However, one day, during a routine operation, my life completely changed.
While setting up a needle, it touched the tip of my finger, and in that moment I realized I’ve never seen what the true black looks like. Until now.

I saw the hole. I saw the black.
Nothing came out.
I was shocked. I spent my life being the best possible person, but my blood was cursed. I was condemned for the rest of my life.

I quit my job and started an internal journey to find the answer for my condition.


How could it be?
But then, I came to my epiphany.

It was simple. Helping others felt good. I didn’t do it because others would feel better; I did it because I would feel better. I didn’t care about the others. I was always interested in my happiness.

In trying to be the less selfish man alive, I have been the most selfish. 
And that was my punishment.
