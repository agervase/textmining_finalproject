Death stalked into his office. Judging by the amount of dust, he realised it had been sometime since he had entered let along sat at his desk. It would take time to clean up the mess that was left there. But after all, time was the one thing he had in abundance. 

After a few hours of cleaning and the stacking a pile of hourglasses into a small crate, he stooped to peer underneath his desk. Underneath what seemed to be centuries of dust was a hourglass. Wondering whose life it was he reached under for it. As he clasped it in his hand, before he had even set eyes on the glass, he knew whose it was. 

“Yes, centuries of dust indeed.” He mused to himself as he brushed the dust off the broken hourglass. There was no name written on this one, no sand filled it anymore, and yet he clutched it almost gently in his hands. 

He began a slow walk down the hall of hourglasses. It took time to pass the ones that still had the sands of time running. But he had time. 

Past heroes of old from the Romans and Greeks to the Egyptians and past. Not often did he comes this way and he paused to admire two larger than ordinary hourglasses marked Gilgamesh and Enkidu. 

He reached out and gingerly felt the wooden shelf just between the two hourglasses, whispering almost to himself. “What tales you weave in your times.”
He stood for a time remembering all he had seen through ages and through the lives of man. 

He began again, past names faded and forgotten until he reached the end of the hallway and a small cabinet made of fine hand carved wood. 

Again he reached out his bony hand to open the cabinet door. It creaked on it’s hinges as he pulled open one of its small doors and then the other. Inside sat another hourglass it’s wooden casing as green as the day it had been made and the sand still flowed. He placed his hourglass back next to hers and sighed. Someday he would see her again. Someday they would be together again, even if time was against him.
