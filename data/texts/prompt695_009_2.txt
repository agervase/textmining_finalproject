It's not that bad being secretly famous. I mean being famous to a very certain category of people. Like Jack is famous among plumbers for his legendary approach to pipes, Joe is known to some as a YouTuber even though his videos are mostly about cucumber gardening and Jill is mildly known for winning a few cooking contests. For any special talent there is an equally special audience. 

Mine are time travelers. I bump into at least two per week. Mostly jolly fellows, tourists. Sometimes pirates, those are not as jolly, even though they're rarely hostile. Time cops, as well. Those are usually ignorant because, well, their job requires them to be not that excited.

I know, you're itching to ask why is that me who is an object of constant interest for time travelers? I guess it's kind of like cats on the internet. I'm no particular cat, but I am interesting as a representative of my folk. My folk being... People of certain interest for time travelers. We're going in circles, but isn't it always so in case of time travel? And speaking of circles, to begin one properly is a hard task. 

Mine began when I was 10 years old. I was a child with vivid imagination, so I've imagined what I could have done if I had a time machine. Just in a year or so that  was handy enough when the first traveler came. What I needed from him was information. Beginner's level. When 36th came, I had enough to travel on my own, but I really needed just one  timejump. I've chosen one of the more trivial coordinate sets, because I needed to bump into another time traveler. 

It was easy to recognize the guy. After all, it's hard to forget your first time traveler. We chatted for a few minutes onboard of "Titanic". "You know, who you absolutely need to see?" I asked? He was curious and the rest was history. And history goes in circles, which move because of self-made men, cool people. Not unlike myself.
