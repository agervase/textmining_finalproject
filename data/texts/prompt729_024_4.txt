A falling sensation, followed by a rude awakening in an unfamiliar place. A moment later it dawns upon me that my yearly Ordeal is upon me once more. For reasons that I have not yet been able to discern, despite some centuries of research through dusty old tomes in a dozen different tongues, it seems that once each year I am to be cast out from my home into unfamiliar surroundings.

Some things I have learn from my research, that this world is the 'true' world of humans, where most (but not all, although I shan't tell too much) are born, live out their brief lives, no more than a century, and die; the cradle, home, and grave to the human race. The world that I was born in, in fact, many millenia ago. 

And what is more, time passes differently here. It seems that each time I enter (return seems technically correct, yet wholly inappropriate) only a day has passed from my last annual sojourn. And what is more is that I am regarded only as an innocent babe in this world. I, the three-thousand year old caretaker of the Library, keeper of the sum total of the knowledge of mankind, no more than a mewling babe!

I struggle for a moment to piece together the far-flung pieces of my memory of my last 'days' in this world. As much as this is an unavoidable nuisance and interruption to my serious studies, I had decided some time in my first millenia to seize the opportunity to better understand the 'reference points' in some materials.

I get up, and search the room for a phone to call Lin Han. Han had been one of my favourite students in the Library, who had agreed to be my guide during the wild and disconcerting days each year when I was unceremoniously thrown out of the Library. After more than forty visits to this world, Han had become something more than a student. Han was a friend.
