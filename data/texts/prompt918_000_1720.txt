*(Fair warning, for whatever reason, I read the title as "you ARE the doctor" and wrote a story. Still fits the prompt though so I'm posting)*

I sit down comfortably in the patient's chair. For whatever reason, Mark, our nurse here is taking a while in back. I feel a little pang of irritation, Mark's always rubbed me wrong, and I know that I rub him wrong too. Every once in a while I'll pray that he gets in a tragic accident, and it never happens. A bummer, since I know someone's listening now too.

... Yeah, been 5 years and I still hardly believe it.
 
Actually, it's kind of amazing how well everyone's taken the whole world being a simulation. I can remember the exact moment we all knew, just over 5 years ago, when every creature in the world tagged with the [SAPIENT] tag suddenly heard an otherworldly voice in their head. Apparently the whole world was created by some sociology grad student in a "higher reality". For reasons which he didn't really explain too well, his project was being cut due to "misconduct", and he had decided to dick around and play God a bit before we got turned off. I started to have a bit of an existential crisis just then, but luckily for humanity's collective emotional state he just turned those off temporarily while we got the news.

Right after he announced he would be trying some changes in "the settings" in a few phases. For a decade (apparently not much longer than a few rotations of their planet) he was going to try certain "utopian settings", which included turning off natural disasters and "PvP", among a bunch of other convoluted changes involving the probability of bad things happening and the quantum physics model the simulation uses. 

By PvP, I mean, it's now impossible to intentionally harm anyone. You can still TRY, but somehow you always fail. Try to tackle someone? Well, there was a banana peel you didn't see. Try to snipe someone standing perfectly still with a high powered sniper rifle you assured works perfectly just before taking the shot?  A banana might fall out of the sky onto your head, distracting you just enough so that you miss the shot just barely. It honestly ruins my immersion, which now knowing that the world is a big simulation, is extremely important to me.

But the real tragedy of no PvP, is no matter how much I want to backhand that dumb asshole Mark, fighting is literally impossible now.

Oh! Here he comes in now with the needle. Christ, it took him forever to prepare that shot, the hell? What I especially hate about Mark isn't really his dullness, or general uselessness, though those are certainly qualities he possesses. It's because he's constantly talking to Sandra. Sandra, or Dr. White properly, has been my coworker for years now. Mark is just new this year, and he'll probably leave soon too. I know he has a crush on her. He knows I have a crush on her. He knows I know he has a crush on her, and of course I know about him knowing that he knows I know he has a crush on her. We're both very painfully aware of each other.

Very painful indeed, I think while I say to Mark, *"Took you long enough, distracted by something unimportant as usual, Mark?"* I force a nice smile, but my tone of voice is pretty condescending. Wait no, my grin was pretty condescending too, damn.

*"Oh, just got distracted talking to Dr. White about something PERSONAL between us two. My apologies, sir. Shall I administer the shot now? Please lie back in the chair."*

... *'something personal'*, the words ring off his voice sweet like honey. I can tell he savors teasing me. "Just administer the damn shot before I have you fired." I let my irritation get the better of me. 

*"W-Well, I, you shouldn't, uh, talk to me li-. D-Dr. White, uh-..."* Mark starts to mumble something, but he stops. He suddenly jabs the needle down at my arm, and I brace myself, he jabbed it pretty hard.

...

Nothing, no sensation at all. I look down at the needle, which is now totally bent across my arm. *"Mark, did you intend to HARM me just then? I see the anti-PvP system must have just triggered. You god damn bastard. I'll charge you with assault."* I ignore the fact that assault isn't a real crime anymore for the moment. Mark has his moment too, going silent and staring at the needle.

*"Well, maybe I DID intend to harm you. F-Fuck you Dr. Johnson! If PvP wasn't off, I'd have hit you for always lording over me and getting so mad when I talk to Dr. White a long time ago!"* Suddenly I see his fist fly at me. But instead of getting hit, Mark trips over the chair, landing headfirst on the floor. I bolt up.

*"That's it! This is self-defense."* My head is full of rage, and I'm aiming a solid kick right at his head before I consider the circumstances at all. Suddenly my legs twists upwards by no will of my own, sending me careening into a shelf holding some recent blood samples, a few of which spill over me and Mark, covering both of us in blood. Mark grabs another needle, aiming it at my neck. I'm terrified, but like the last it just bends and flies out of Mark's hand. I grab a clipboard to smash Mark over the head, but I lose my grip and it flies into the florescent lighting above, smashing half of it. Suddenly Mark starts running, and I give chase. I think I hear Sandra's voice at the other end of the building yelling, she must have heard the commotion.

Breaking my train of thought is Mark, taking a hard right into the supplies closest. I try to grab him and pull him down, but his shirt just comes off, unbuttoning itself and slipping off perfectly in a motion that kind of reminds me of pulling a tablecloth from a table. I flip on the supply room lights, and suddenly see Mark with a collection of surgical tools. He's picked the largest scalpel in the collection, and I reach for the second largest. He can't do anything to stop me, because when he does his arm suddenly spasms out of my way. We both suddenly stop and stare at each-other. 

*"This is it Mark, we can't do this anymore. It'll never work..."* I lament. Mark is silent, but then slowly nods. *"... You're right, Dr. Johnson. We're both totally unharmed, we can't beat the simulation."* I pause, offering a tentative hand, *"Let's shake on it and be done with it?"* Mark nods and extends his hand. Hah, the fool. I'm just going to stab him and pretend it's a surgery! Maybe then it'll work! Just as I get to stabbing Mark, I suddenly feel something prod against my stomach. His scalpel! Bastard tried to trick me! Unforgivable even if it literally CAN'T hurt me.

But more alarming than that, is the sudden arresting voice in my head I hear. This is God (the grad student) speaking, and time slows to a standstill accordingly. *"Hey gentlemen and ladies of my favorite little world simulation, I'm getting shut down a few days earlier than I thought here in higher reality, so I'm speeding up my settings tests. I've decided to turn PvP and natural disasters back on. This time it's the opposite, bad things are even worser, or um, I mean more worse than they use to be. Like if you get stabbed, this time it'll hurt even MORE than I used to have it hurt. Like, uh, maybe ten times more? I'm not really sure. But yeah, no more utopia, just dystopia. Make it interesting, cheers."* I hardly even have a moment to digest the situation, because there's a scalpel in my gut, and when I look down at my own stomach, I see I've successfully stabbed Mark too. 

We both scream.
