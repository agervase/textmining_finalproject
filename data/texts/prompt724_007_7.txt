I coughed as the smoke cleared.  How did I even burn something, I was just putting the icing on!

<SPEAK YOUR BIDDING, MORTAL!>

I rolled my eyes at the booming voice.  "James, is this you trying to be PrankMan again?  Jesus, you ne-"

<shhhhh!  Don't say His name so loud, He might hear!>

I paused in confusion.  The voice sounded legitimately afraid.  I waved my hand ineffectually at the still-thick smoke.  "Are you trying to prank *James*?  Tim?  Jesus, dude, I can't see a thing, who is this?"  I finally found the extractor fan switch and clicked it to full.

The fan pulled the smoke up and out of my kitchen, and I chuckled as the end of a fake rubber snake came into view.  A goofy-looking foot with scales and claws was next, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud.  "A Godzilla costume?  Halloween is months..."  The words died in my throat as the knee came into view; *it bent backwards*.

"Jesus, man, are you okay?  We need to get that leg to a hospi-"  I turned back from my phone as I heard the man crash to the floor.  He was curled up in a ball, sobbing and hiding his head.  Dedicated costume, though - horns and everything.  I knelt down and put my arm around his shoulders for comfort.

"Hey, man, it's going to be okay.  Hang in there, alright?  I'm calling 9-1-1."

The man's head turned to look at me, and turned, and turned... My blood ran cold as his head made a smooth 180 and looked behind his own back - neck injury?  Then I noticed the teeth, and the worms, and the eyes, dear God the eyes...

"Jesus Christ, what in Hell?..."

A fresh round of sobs shook the creature's body.  In a barely audible whisper, it choked out <please stop saying His name...>

Two cups of strong black coffee later, it had calmed down enough to speak.

"So you're a demon?"

<Yes.>

"Like, from Hell?"

<Yes.>

"And I *summoned you*?  By humming along with the radio while icing a cake?!"

<With the Word and the Feast, yes.  Did you not know what you were speaking?>

"Uh, Gregorian Chants?  Something something Latin something domino?"

<Not Gregorian - Jesuit.  Called 'God's Soldiers', or simply 'the Company.'  'Mala ut purgare' - 'bring the evil to me that I may cleanse it'.  You were reciting their hunting spell.>

"Hunting *what?!*"  I looked at the creature in front of me (but not the eyes, never those again!) and decided to roll with it.  "Uh, okay.  You said something about a feast?  All I was doing was icing an Angel's Food cake."

<Not 'feast', Feast.  Do you see my left arm?>

I hadn't though to look before.  "You, uh, don't have one?  Is that a, um, demon thing?"

<Have you considered what angels *eat*?>

<Michael caught me.  He smiled sweetly, and told me he would start with my arm; then he tore it off and ate it.  Someone more important came into view, but he warned me he'd be back to finish his meal.>

My mind reeled.  "Je-...Sorry, um, wow.  You'll have to let me think a moment, this is a lot to swallow."  The demon made a disgusted face.  "Sorry!  Didn't mean it that way.  Um, just a lot to...process. Mentally.  That's all."

The pounding at the door shook us both to our bones.
