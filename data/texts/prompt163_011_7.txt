A lone female stands alone at her locker. She must be careful, this area has many males prowling around. The males in this area are loud, and often travel in packs. Each pack has a lead male, or alpha. Look! Look there! A pack of males have entered the corridor and have taken notice of the lone female. That is pack 69, their alpha is a member of the species, *Fuckboy*. 

The male must be cautious. If he fails to court her, it will cause him to lose status within the pack and will encourage other males to challenge his dominance. He approaches the female with a smirk, a facial expression to show smugness and overconfidence. The female takes notice and tries to ignore him. Unfortunately, this inflates his ego even more. Members of the species *Fuckboy* use imitation tactics and careful flirting to court females.

The young male slams the locker shut, startling the poor female and manages to trap the lone female. His pack members are grinning and encouraging him, and the female is blushing. Blushing is a sign of embarrassment, and is also a signal that the female is interested. 

The male leans in close and presses a kiss to her lips. The female is too caught up in the moment to notice that he slips a piece of paper into her hand. She did not retaliate, and stands there dazed. The male grins and pulls away, and makes a *call me* motion with his hand. That is a sign that he wants her to communicate with him, using a device called a *Smart Phone*. All she has to do is to input the number she received to start communicating. 

This male has managed to court many females in the past, and he has just snagged another victim.
