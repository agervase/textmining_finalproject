Read the top response and this is like that but with slight differences, and omnipotence.

"I wish to understand every language!" And then the pain came in, it flooded my mind as every single language, spoken by man during the times of Jesus to now, from man to animal, from Earth to every language that simply existed but what was most interesting was maybe the single most important language.

The coding language that ran the Universe.
And I understood it all.

My mind changed the illusive figures that may in my head to ellegible characters. Dots and lines turned to As and Es. Child-like circles and markings became comprehendible words and phrases.

And there, in front of me stood the Genie. Or, in the code of the Universe [E.MW.P92.Genie092] the language was rather simple, the first letter, E meant Entity, anything living was E, anything that was an Object was an O and everything else in-between was a U. The second to third meant "Milky Way" and the Fourth to soxth represent which planet. Earth bring P92 and Mars P93. It took a bit of getting used to but it all came to me in the end. and the genie, who loomed over me grinning, hoping I was dead from the flood of knowledge causing my heart to go into cardiac arrest as my blood began to pump harder forcing more water to my brain to help it but I got up, matching my grin to his as he stared at me in confusion and, even if it was remote, horror and I simply stated one thing; "E.MW.P92.Genie092/removelimb.LeftArm removelimb.RightArm" so not one thing, or something simple, but either way, the affects were the same. Both his arms simply disappeared.

(I had more plans but had to go, if someone wants to copy and paste this, go right ahead)
