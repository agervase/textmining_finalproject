It’s not that I have anything to prove.

But the people call to me.

I’ve just given peace to the Brits across the channel, I’ve already done more for European Unity than any man before me; not the Furher, not the Little Corporal, not even the great Roman Empire was able to extend wealth and prosperity to this great continent as I have.

The Ruski have always been part of our family. Their last true leader was cousins with the King & Kaiser and their heritage is intertwined with ours.

They belong with us. 

No, they deserve to be with us. A part of the great continent I am shaping.

It’s not that it’s never been done before, it’s just never been done properly. The reasons earlier men failed when trying to straddle tame huge beast have been written about innumerable times but it generally boils down to a mix of over-confidence in their own plans and underestimating the enemy.

That won’t be me.

War is very different now. As much as Hitler had mastered his primitive mix of man and machine and Napoleon had mastered his cavalry and cannons I have taken things to a new level.

Expert precision to take out key individuals, peacekeepers who will bring fire to anyone that resists but gifts to those who help and most importantly a public knowledge arm that will show the Russians the greatness that awaits them in a united Europe.

I have never failed before.

Just as in the Isles there will be some resistance, what do they say about cracking eggs to make an omelette, but given time their people will love me, they will want me. I can only foresee them dropping arms and joining us once my knowledge battalion begins their broadcasts.

I have no doubt that we’ll be celebrating in Moscow before Christmas.

Celebrating me and my United Europe.
