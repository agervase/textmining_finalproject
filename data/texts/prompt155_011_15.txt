It was a joke, really. All that sadness and guilt and all was getting way too much to handle. So I figured I would throw my last dollar away on a house I'd wanted since young, since my depression would probably end my life sooner or later. As soon as I stepped in, my first moment of joy was ruined completely.

"Hey there."

"OK, voice in my head and all, fuck you. You've caused me enough trouble throughout my whole life, so just fuck off and shut up," was my (probably drunken) reply.

"We're not voices. We're your *friends*." On cue, 7 little red dudes popped out of the closet. Except they had horns. Did humans have horns? Probably not.

"What the fuck?" was my only reply after 5 seconds of gaping.

"We're here to get your act back together," another said promptly. Instantly, I felt a change going on. The anger, the grief; they were leaving slowly. And in its place I felt the first pangs of happiness in the last 3 months. The dinner table was filled with a luxurious meal, items I coveted from others in my possession, a cheque for an infinite amount of money appeared in my hand and doorbell rang at that precise instant. It was my crush. And a newfound courage seized me to ask her out.

It was the best feeling I had ever felt in my life when she agreed.

I hurried out, her chasing after me in youthful exuberance as I approached my car. But as I was about to get in, I heard a voice speak gravely behind me. The only demon that had not budged from my arrival.

"Go back."

"Why dude? We're gonna go get some dinner, then maybe a...romantic movie!" I snapped my fingers as I prepared to open the door.

"GO. BACK." The tone...scared me. At the same instant, my new girlfriend's face suddenly paled, as she staggered back towards the house. "I'm not feeling too well," she said, as I hurried to bring her back. As I was about to give Sloth a death glare, he said, without a hint of a smile on his face, "You'll thank me for that soon."

Chinese takeout wasn't the romanticism I was looking for, but it sufficed for a first date. As I lounged around, watching my girlfriend devour her food, a new flash came in. The news reporters face looked just as grave, if not graver than Sloth's.

"We have just received news that a terror attack has taken place at Outback Steakhouse. Before the police force could intervene, the terrorists set off a bomb within the restaurant, killing everyone inside. No survivors have been found yet."

I was just about to drive to Outback.

The reporter droned on in the background as I stared, horrified at the screen. But right in my line of vision, Sloth waved, then whispered, "I told you so."
