"McMahon, first wakeup"

I pull the curtain back closed on my rack and think about my crazy ass dream.  We were at battlestations, shit was going sideways.  I could hear the water roaring in below from Engine Room Upper Level.  Fucking Harris.  Nub, dink as shit, barely qualified the damn watch.  Now he's going to make it so we go down one more than we come up.
I rub the sleep out of my eyes.  Can't get another catnap before the next wakeup, might as well get my chow.  I slip on my poopy suit and tie my boots.  My poopy smells alright.  Maybe go another few days before I sit laundry watch.
The chow line is empty, so I go right to the galley and get my plate.  Midrats- a can of ravioli and leftover chicken pasta.  Coffee is hot, though.  I sit next to Harris, who looks as tired as I feel.  We eat quietly, I don't look up.  When I do, I notice I don't recognize the cook.  He's a third class by his dungaree shirt- why's he wearing that?  His hair is pomaded over into a shiny Elvis thing.  He takes my plate and I see his faded hula girl tattoo.  No words for me, just a puff of cigarette smoke out of his nose.
I turn the wheel and head aft.  Up the steps, the Upper Level watch looks over the moon to see me.  I don't recognize him.  He looks young.  He gives me the lowdown in a turnover spiel: continuing sea trials, just tested the emergency blow system.  Seems to have a few bugs yet.  He signs off and I relieve him.  I've never seen a man so happy to be offgoing.  You'd think he stood the watch for fifty years.
Chief comes by with a hat for me.  I look down at his belt buckle: USS Scorpion was his usedta-fish.  Name rings a bell.  I remember something about a torpedo, but I'm a little fuzzy.  Chief smiles.
"Watch can get a little boring, shipmate, but you will be relieved soon enough.  Here, take this.  We'll have some training in a little while."
The hat says USS Dutchman.  The logs go on forever, but they're not heavy.  I sign in.  I have the watch.
