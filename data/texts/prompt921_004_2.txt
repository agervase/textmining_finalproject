They didn't understand. They never understand. 

He had to take the gator with him. Without the gator under his arm, he couldn't have possibly warded off the necromancer raccoon from entering the convenience store and if he would have gotten in...That mermaid might not be alive. No mermaid, no Earth, as the saying goes. 

So now that Florida Man had tracked down that necromancer, eating mangoes no less, he would have to burn him alive to stop this evil sorcery once and for all. But little did the residents know that this necromancer was also a shape shifter and at this time was a cute little raccoon, eating away at those tasty mangoes. So when Florida Man rightfully lit him on fire, residents were appalled.  They dragged our hero away in cuffs, but were forced to end the Necromancers life's themselves once they realized what he truly was. None of that made the papers, though. 

They released Florida Man once the news stopped following that story. But soon enough, our hero had a bizarre meltdown at an airport, or so the story says. Carrying the vaccine for zombieson his person, Florida Man was in pursuit by Corporate Goons who want the profit for themselves. They attempted to take him down, much like a black man, but their attempts were thwarted when Florida Gator suddenly manifested onto the scene and caused a slight fracas. This gave Florida Man enough time to escape. 

Once home, Florida Man rushed in to give his girlfriend the vaccine. He was heart broken upon realizing she was sick beyond repair. He shot her and left, crying his heart out. When he returned to make himself a Hungry Man dinner, he realized she was still walking, dead, hungry for him, man! So he shot her again like a good Florida Man, this time in the head and got the hell out of there. He made sure to get his two cans of fart spray before leaving.
