After the End, most of everyone's energy was devoted to survival—first, learning how to survive in our new world, and then in the soul-crushing work of living each day. I was a lucky one. The skills I’d known before the End were invaluable now. I could trap and kill the miserable, irradiated horrors that passed for wildlife. Still, as most animals died off, as most humans killed them and then each other, hunger gnawed at my belly more often than not.

My fingers pinched less and less of the flesh around my gut each week—a gut no low-carb diet could get rid before. I felt the angles of my face sharpen a little more. And my hands… I shake, now. It’s not the nightmares, or the memories. It’s the feebleness of hunger.

I write this into the margins of what books I’ve left, and onto the walls with what liquid will stain: Three years of hunger, almost incessant famine. The companions I knew and the survivors rumored have most certainly died by now. I alone, I suspect, stand for what passed of the human race.

I alone—and *him*.

I’ve roamed, I’ve hidden. I’ve squirreled myself behind padlocked bunkers, and concealed myself within the the heart of old sewers. Still he finds me, leaves it like a gift at the foot of the bed. It’s not a gift!

Before the End, it may have seemed so. I remember the day so clearly.

I was five, gap-toothed in front of the banner that read I was the grand prize winner. He introduced himself to me, then—a firm handshake and a grin.

*Hi, I’m George. I’m a deliveryman. I heard you won the big prize. Don’t worry, I’ve never missed a monthly visit.*

His grin hardened. His eyes went flat. *Don’t worry. I won’t ever, ever let you down.*

It’s not a gift. It’s not a prize to live in these dark times. When the End came, we said that Satan walked this earth. Well, I never saw Satan, but I can tell you one thing: I know his deliveryman.
