The light tube flickered. A spray of green splats against it, tinting the room. 

The small crowd roars. The stout Munger is on top now. “Boss! Boss! Boss!”

He pulverizes the skull of the Ling against the floor of the forecastle. The body of the Ling stopped twitching. It's sickly yellow skin is covered in its own blood; the yellow sclera of its eye ripped and dangling. 

The Munger shoves through the crowd to collect his winnings from the cage. A teen male, human and scared. The Munger grabbed the boy his hair and yanked him from the cage, triggering his fight or flight response. 
The tube running from his carotid artery to the vial on his back excretes a few precious drops of adrenaline. 

The scent of those scant drops fills the nostrils of every creature in the room. The Munger roars, reminding them that they could be the next Ling. 

The light in the room cuts out. Two shrill beeps. The ship is about to be boarded. Everyone is quiet. 

“Kessaw freighters are never searched.”

“They must be looking for a bribe,” whispered another. 

The freighter sat still in space. The engines humming idle. The crowd growing restless with each minute of uncertainty. 

The door of the forecastle melts away. Armed soldiers storm the room. The brave fools that resisted had their forelimbs erased. Those that didn't have any anymore had more personal areas deleted. 

The Munger was caught red-handed with the human milk cow and hauled away, the body of the unconscious boy too.

…

When the boy awoke later in sickbay the Munger and a soldier were there waiting for him. 

The boy screamed upon seeing him again. 

“It's okay. You're safe now. I'm officer Pok,” the Munger said.  

“Officer Pok has been looking for you for a long time,” said the soldier next. “Let's get you home.”
