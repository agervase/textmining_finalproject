Spartacus gazed on the legions as they spread far and wide until the horizon. The servile wars were no longer just part of Roman history as we'd known it, it was his legacy. Spartacus the II, leader of the fourth servile rebellion was calm and composed. He turned around to face his compatriots: "we will get what we need. We will get what we want. But we will never get what we deserve!" shouted Spartacus, as he hoisted up his railgun  he affectionately nicknamed Etna. The Rebels cheered in an uproar.

This was by far the largest of the servile wars. It has been nearly two decades since the annexation of the 7th galactic quadrant, but the real  problems started when the Senate didn't veto emperor Crassus' legislation Neo magna terra. "Do we never learn anything from history?" I thought to myself as Spartacus delivered his speech. The provinces have never been so neglected, what did the Senate expect? That we'd roll over and die on the planet the empire's Magna Terra was exploiting? I had never seen Rome myself, and nor have I been on Magna Terra. I, like my fellow compatriots, was born far, far away. And yet here we are, fighting oppressors we'd never truly see, for a Rome that is almost as mythological as Hannibal's war elephants. 

"For liberty!" Shouted the rebels in unison as they charged down the valley. Plasma blasts started flying through the air and the legions fired back. These were the best odds we'd had in years, but still, the legions were a force to be reckoned with. The letters SPQR tagged every legionary war vehicle, letters that we hated so much by now. The rebels and the legionaries collided. War cries of old and plasma cooling canisters flooded the battlefield. The fourth servile war had begun.
