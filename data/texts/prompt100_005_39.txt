Something different! Time to change **less** to **more**.

-------------

Nobody really expected such day. It was a day when the world got to know of him. It was the day when Shaun entered the city where the strongest Wizards were supposed to be.

But after a long journey, it was only natural that Shaun would try to find a place where to sit down and relax. So, he walked to the nearest tavern called *Unpopular Responses*. It was a bit old-school western styled tavern, which was full of different kind of people. Many of them wore bright wizardly clothing to show off their status. But most importantly, they all were relaxing and eating.

And Shaun did the same thing. He casually got himself seated behind an empty table.

"Hello. Welcome to the *Unpopular Responses*. What can we serve you?" a women came to the table, smiling, ready to take the order.

"Some chicken and beer," Shaun said, not even looking at the menu. "Just get me something with chicken. Smashed potatoes, perhaps?"

"Of course, we'll get you your food in fifteen minutes," the woman said and walked off, leaving Shaun all alone.

Shaun frowned, leaning back and looking around the room. It was supposed to be the city of the strongest wizards. Yet he felt nothing. Which only meant that there weren't any wizards nearby or they weren't using magic. Pity.

"Hey," a voice came in front of Shaun, making him look towards the sound. A boy had himself seated on the other chair. "Do me a card trick!" he said.

"Excuse me?" Shaun said, laughing.

"Come on. You're a wizard, aren't you?"

Shaun laughed. "Call me intrigued! How did you figure that out?"

The boy smirked. "Because you just admitted it," he said.

Shaun laughed, once more. "Smart boy, tricking me like that."

The boy leaned forward. "Now it's only fair if you do me a card *trick* in return," he said.

"Fine," Shaun said, nodding. It was just a tiny bit of magic after all. Even he didn't think that anyone would notice.

He smiled and stared at the boy. The boy got his hands into the pockets and removed a pack of cards, just for such occasions. He put the cards on the table and stared at Shaun. But without even lifting a finger, Shaun stared at the cards, and the cards began shuffling themselves.

"Whoa," the boy said. But the room had instantly gone silent. Everyone looked at Shaun, terrified.

"I-I-Is he... He isn't even using powerful magic," one of the men whispered.

Shaun looked around and slowly smirked. "I see," he muttered to himself. The front door opened and various wizards ran in, sweaty and just searching for the owner of such magical presence. Many of them were pale from the presence alone.

"What's the matter?" Shaun asked, looking around the room. "It's as you've seen a ghost."

"Did you all come here to see the trick?" the boy asked, oblivious of what was going on.

"Wh-who are you?" One of the older wizards said as he got in front of everyone.

"Me?" Shaun said, still shuffling the cards with his magic. "I'm just a traveler who is showing a child a card trick," he explained. They all stared at him, sweaty. "At least for now," he finally added.
