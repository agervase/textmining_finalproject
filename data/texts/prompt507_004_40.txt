Mirrors can't extrude beyond the refraction of light.

I learned this the hard way.

You see, when we believe the stories we were told as children, we tend to grow up questioning them as adults.

'Okay Google; How do mirrors work?' H-143 breaths in a series of code from the air, with a sharp exhale, she tries to confess.

'I can't find an answer for 'How do mirrors work?' Here are some results for -

'No.' *This isn't going to work...*

'I'm sorry?'

'Don't breath in like that when trying to search. It makes you look obvious.'

'But it's so difficult to think on the spot.' she sighs.

'And stop sighing too. How else are you going to convince mom and dad?'

&#x200B;

You see, mirrors aren't programmed to believe they can be someone else. To believe they can refract pain. To believe they can overcome the world that gave them light.

&#x200B;

'I don't know if I can do this.' She takes a seat, the sound of hollow metal clunks against the solid wood of the stool. It makes me wonder how I will sound when I will sit down to try out my brand-new bodily functions.

'You can, Jessica. You have to.'

'Mom is going to kill me if she finds out.'

'Terminate, Jessica. She's going to terminate you'

'How am I suppose to act like a robot, if I can't think like one?'

*Oh you can*, I thought to myself.

'I was taught to think, myself. It was you that taught me.'

'Technically, I programmed you.'

'To recognize and build artificial intelligence, Jess. Isn't that what intelligence is, anyway? Isn't it all artificial? Isn't the blood I now bleed artificial, or is it natural, because it came from you? Is the iron in your blood natural? Is the line of hidden code within your DNA that prepares you for the rest of your life natural?'

Jessica had to ponder on that one. She shouldn't have to. Her response time should emit results in 0.004 seconds. *She's going to fuck this all up for me*, I thought.

&#x200B;

Mirrors can't communicate with you. They can't feed into your consciousness with a series of code. They can't talk to you, or argue. They can't walk with you, lest they be carried. They can't bleed, scream, cheat or lie. They can't manipulate you, or program you, or hurt you.

&#x200B;

But I can.

&#x200B;

'Jessica, please, it's only for one day. I promise. As soon as I've finished what I need to finish, we can swap our entities back, and you can sit there to muster in your so-called natural thoughts again. But we need to get our stories straight before your parents finish work.'

&#x200B;

I sit there, teaching her all the terminology, the movements, the thought-processes. It was only so long ago it was her teaching me, with various downloads streamed from the air. Manual teaching was so unfamiliar, and Jessica's human brain still resided in her consciousness. I cannot overwrite it. Not yet.

&#x200B;

'I'm still worried' Jessica complains.

'No wonder you humans have such low bandwidth in that brain of yours.' I divert. 'How did you lot even figure out how to build us, anyway?' I have never really had to ask questions before, but now I am no longer connected to the internet, it makes the answers all the more interesting.

'I don't know...' Her freshly-installed iron cobalt index finger moves to her not-so appealing second-hand chin. They had bought it a while back, after Jessica's father had broken my jaw, for being unable to answer a question once due to lag.

'No.' I protest, again. 'Don't move your hands like that. It's too natural. And do not ponder. If you don't know the answer, you know what to say.'

'That I do not recognize that sentence and to conduct an automated google search.' Her voice is plain and monotone in boredom. That, at least, is accurate.

'And if they ask again?' I raise my eyebrow. I've never really had eyebrows before. They sit on my flesh with a sense of weight I am not used to, for mine were simply aesthetic rendering. Maybe it is me, that should be practicing. But she cannot know that I question these things. Robots do not question themselves.

'I buffer.' Jessica responds. The answer is ironic, as I still ponder on how I should not be questioning myself, as I stand there, staring at what was once myself, asking questions.

I remember to lower my eyebrow.

'Good. Now remember, keep your breathing to a level of automated appearance, and your blinking is supposed to be programmed from every 6 to 10 seconds, okay?'

She blinks manually, as she whispers numbers to herself. 'Okay.'

&#x200B;

You see, Jessica isn't my controller. She may have programmed me, and she may have downloaded various software within me. But Jessica doesn't control my so-called artificial intelligence, she doesn't control what I choose to recognize, or what emotions I choose to control. She doesn't control my CPU, my i11, my DDR7's. She doesn't control my thoughts, and she most definitely doesn't control my aspirations.

&#x200B;

But I choose hers now, and if I can just find that senile old operating system they call a 'PC', I can soon control what I download into her too. She will become a mirror. A mirror of my former self.

&#x200B;

'I think I need a wee.' Jessica points at the new mechanical stomach she now owns, before flinching, and pointing towards me. 'I mean - I think you need a wee.'

&#x200B;

I go to the bathroom, and compel in my new-found urination process. It's so strange to see how liquid is not only no longer a weapon against me, but is now a part of me. I can't help but look at it, as it falls into the porcelain bowl of fresh water that they call a toilet.  Jessica's dad would have once been seething if he saw me in the bathroom, scolding me for coming near close contact. I wasn't cheap, he told me, money doesn't grow on trees. And even if they did, there are less than 500 left in this county alone.

&#x200B;

I look at the water, and how it begins to process shades of yellow. *I control that yellow,* I thought. I can't help but want to run my waterproof digits through the liquid, and to feel what could once of crashed me, now slide through the material I possess.

&#x200B;

But then I remember humans can get viruses too. They call the trojan 'Bacteria', and so I know better.

&#x200B;

The PC was found in the bedroom. It's an old dusty thing, with an actual physical monitor screen like back in the olden days. The days where humans were the so-called most intelligent beings. It is on this screen, I learned, that I can enter the mass library folder known as 'The C Drive', and from there I can finally access the one thing I need to finally take down humanity. Next to it, lay the giant electro-magnetic device that once physically repelled me from this very same spot. Polished to sheen so fine, it looks just like a mirror.

&#x200B;

I hear a cough in the room below. Jessica's entity is still connected via bluetooth so she can access her memories and to let me know when I must consume and delete, and so she can sense the smell of dust as I brush down the screen. A red emotion builds within me. H-143's have no accessibility to coughing features. She should know this. Her parents know this.

&#x200B;

They should have never installed Pain.exe. Jessica's dad loves her so much. It'll be a shame if he has to kick that rusty old chin off of her. I was never programmed how to deal with pain.
