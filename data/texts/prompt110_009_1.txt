So This Bloke Works In This Bar...

Friday night, come on, only one more hour to go, you can do this. What's this now?
"Mate, you can't leave that tiny piano on the bar, that little twelve inch tall bloke keeps eating all the beernuts."
Honestly, it never ends.
"What's that mate? Another whiskey? Still not got rid of the taste yet? Ah, keep trying, I'm sure you'll get there."
Poor fucker. Speaking of which, look who it is.
"Alright Eric? The usual?"
Not sure why he always looks so upset, he has a dick like a horse. I've learned not to mention his face to him though, he has a hell of a kick. Oh not this idiot again.
"How many times do I have to fucking tell you, this is a bar, not a club!"
Why do they all have to come in here?
"Oi dickhead! Yeah I know you're a cheese sandwich, out! What's that? Yeah, your friend the jumper cable can come in but he knows the rules."
At a certain point I just feel like I'm repeating myself with these cretins.
"Watch your head mate.."
Every. Fucking. Time.
"Evening gents, the usual table? Yeah no worries, I'll bring them over."
All they do is argue about religion, get drunk and then kick the shit out of each other. Bishops do tip well though. Christ, look at the state of this one coming in.
"Are you OK mate? You were beaten up? That's shocking mate, you peanuts can't go anywhere safely can you?"
Nearly done, nearly done...oh great, this guy.
"Pint of Bud? There you go, the mop is in the usual place." 
Fucking skeletons, I donâ€™t know why they bother.
"OK, last orders please! Yeah there you go mate, Screwdriver for you, double vodka for the piece of asphalt."
Thank fuck that shift is over. Now I need to get back home and find some people to help me change that lightbulb.
