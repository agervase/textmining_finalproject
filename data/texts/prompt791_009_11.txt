The fire of freedom shone bright in the hearts of the Orcs of the Horkistan Workers Party (HWP). Together with allies from the native beasts of the land, the guerrilla forces of HWP had been waging a war on the Alliance of Noble Races (ANR) for over 40 years. The ANR was a fascist dictatorship hellbent on genociding the "lesser races" whether it be a mighty dragon or a lowly goblin. Due to the technological advantage of ANR, the attempts at conventional warfare against them had been unsuccessful. Yet the people still sung the songs of great chief Kahwa the Hammerer and his millions, how they fought and how they died in honor and glory centuries later. 

Fortunately for HWP, the orcs, goblins and the beasts were not the only ones that were interested in a multi-etnic, multi-religious alliance of anarcho-syndicalist communes. The ideology also attracted the rare elf, or human. These dedicated comrades provided essential services that HWP could not obtain for themselves. Services such as... logistics and procurement.

That is how I, Matulovic, find myself on a cart loaded with weapons heading into the mountains. See, I am a shopkeeper by day. But by night, I am a dedicated revolutionary for the HWP. My position as a shopkeeper gives me access to cheap second hand weapons. I gather and supply them to the HWP, keeping the revolution alive. The cause gives me hope for the future but you have to turn a blind eye to certain things to keep your sanity. For example, I try to ignore where the weapons came from. For, I am afraid that if I think too much I can recognize these weapons I keep buying and buying over and over again. It is like the only revolution happens in the revolution of these weapons between the hands of ANR and HWP. As I wipe the blood of a battered shield, I recognize it as the one I gave Rokhda last winter. She was a witty goblin, smart as they come and full of life...

That is the reality of it. Life in HWP is often short and brutal. Average life expectancy of a HWP guerilla is only 4 years. Most of that is spent traveling by the night between dark dank caves, with little food and always cold. Sometimes I think of the adventurers complaining about the baths in the inn they stay at, or the food being too hot... They are complaining about their lives in comfort, while their enemies suffer day in and day out without a peep.

Even when they are successful in bypassing the thermal lodestones, spying roc and the constant scouring of elven mages, the victories are hardly ever anything other than Pyrrhic. For each casualty they inflict on the ANR, HWP forces suffer 4... Fighting a supremely powerful military force, they don't aim to take and hold land. Their goal is making the occupation of tribal lands costly for the occupiers. Yet, they pay many times more, and still come back to haunt lone ANR patrols, and outposts every spring as the snow melts in the mountains. Sometimes, I wonder if there is ever an end to this fight...

I see an ANR patrol on the roadside. They pull me over and start inspecting the crates in the back of the cart. I am not worried as ANR does not believe Orcs to be cunning enough to organize smuggling operations. I hear them joking about how they caught two female goblins. They tell in gruesome detail what they did to the greenskin filth. Keeping an impassive face gets easier over the years. I try not to think of Rokhda as they go over my merchant's license. The officer comes up to the front of the cart and says:

-There is an irregularity with the license, it expired last week.

-I did not notice officer. Thanks for letting me know, I will renew it as soon as I get to town.

-You know we can not just let you go like this... There are forms to be filed, and approvals to be obtained. I think I can file for expedited processing for you for the small fee of 10 gold.

I don't have that kind of money on me. They are going to confiscate the cart and I will have to file a petition with the governor's office... Too many of these petitions can put me on the radar of authorities. I start sweating a bit.

Just then I hear a 'twonk' and the officer slumps towards the cart with the feathers of a black arrow sticking out his neck. More 'twonks' and I see the soldiers falling to the ground with shafts sticking out. Some soldiers manage to take cover by the trees and start shouting at each other to organize, but without the commanding officer the defense is feeble and they are quickly overrun. It doesn't mean the ambush was costless for the HWP though, as several Orc berserkers lie bleeding. I hurry the healing potions, but it is too late for most of them. I think I know that one with the gut wound... Markhir. Stoic fella but very reliable. 

I kneel down and our eyes meet. He knows gut wounds are terrible, death can take days... If not the bleeding, the septic shock usually gets the victim... An all together unpleasant business. I hold his hand and drive my dagger into his heart. 

-Rest in power comrade, you will live on in our songs.
