"Here I sit broken hearted had to shit but only.....".  Had I know this would be the last sentence spoken on Earth I may have chose differently.  Nah! Probably not.  

Clyde stood with a look of horror on his face.  

He summoned a demon during one of its most vile acts.  After all I was browsing r/thunderhips having a good fap and hopeful to complete my bi-weekly deuce.  

The summoning excitement resulted in an epic bowel movement followed by a cosmic orgasm, must of which stuck to Clyde's neatly pressed shirt.  The spray and splash radius of the sphincter blowout coated his pristinely hemmed slacks.  Clyde's face contorted, his body lurching forward as the vegan salad mixture emptied from his stomach.

My body realizing there is no longer a toilet supporting its weight it collapses onto the ground, trying to gain my bearings I attempt to stand up only to slip head over toes and land face first onto the ground.  Sitting up a dull pain fills my nose and warmth begins to radiate down my face, neck, chest and stomach.  There was no doubt my nose was broken.

"What I have I done!!  Sweet Joseph Smith what I have done!"  said Clyde.

Moaning, covered in filth, confused and starting to get hungry I asked "Where am I?", "What's going on?" and "Who are you?"

Clyde catches his breath looks me in the eyes and says "I am Clyde Smith, descendant of Joseph Smith.  God spoke to me and asked that I summon you.  Together we are to travel to Zion, propelling the movement as Brigham Young once did, spreading the word.  Together we are to build a new city in Utah where all Mormons can gather.  It will be called Zeon."  

Continuing to look at Clyde I asked "Am I in hell?"
