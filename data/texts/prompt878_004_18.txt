Alice didn’t know what to say. About a minute ago, she kissed her pet frog goodnight. She’d never done this before, but knowing he was about to be put down tomorrow, she thought she’d give him one last display of affection. The poor frog has been ill for a week, and he’s suffering. The vet said it would be best for the poor thing to be freed of his pain.

Now a freakishly tall, handsome man with a perfectly trimmed beard in what seemed like a robe you’d wear centuries ago is standing right in front of her, in her bedroom. While she was examining the man, he ranted on and on about how he’s going to award her for freeing him. “What’s up with rose scented baths?” Alice thought. Luckily, her parents aren’t home. They were out of town, but when she called her about the frog, they promised they’d return tomorrow. She hoped they didn’t decide to return faster, because they’d for sure hear the man. His voice was deep, and sounds exactly like a bad shakespearean actor. He speaks ancient English, but not so old that she couldn’t understand.

“Um, hello?”

“My name is King Edward, my lady, not – what did you call it again? Fellow.”

“Sorry – what? I said hello.”

“What is hello?”

“Okay you know what? I didn’t ask for this. Can you please get out of my room?”

“To where, I ask you? I know not the whereabouts of this..” He gestured around while subtly looking confused.

“Okay. Where are you from? I’m doing that and we’re done.”

“Such attitude for a young lady! I’m from the great Oxford Stronghold, the greatest of all castles! Now shall we return to it?”

Alice knew that place, she lived near it. It was an old brimstone castle on a grassy hill. Knowing she has no other choices, she agreed.

“Okay, I’ll show you what it is now.”
