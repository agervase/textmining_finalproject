I glance down at my notepad as my stomach rumbles.

*"But our job is to know beyond a shadow of a doubt," says one woman. "I don't want to convict someone if we're not sure."*

I'd written down all the options for lunch. I was considering the chinese, but that rumbling was for something more substantial. It had to be barbecue, but what?

*"I don't think we're gonna get any better." Chimes another woman. "We don't always get all the pieces, but I think we have enough to be sure."*

The pulled pork?

*"He was the last person known to have made contact." This time, a balding man. "And you saw the things he had in his apartment."*

Rotisserie?

*"Being a fan of horror films doesn't make you a murderer" A young man. "That's just the prosecutor trying to bias us."*

They said if we went over $25 we'd have to cover the rest, but steak is always worth it.

*"That's not what I'm talking about though." Says the first woman. "How can we be sure, if we don't know where the rest of the body is? A hundred pounds of flesh don't just up and disappear."*

My mouth begins to water.

*"She's right" The young man again. "The accused is a cab driver, and his car is tracked, and the victim doesn't have a car, so he couldn't have moved it very far"*

Something about this conversation seems familiar. It just makes me even more hungry. I try to tune them out.

*"I've seen that area." says an old man. "Young folk out at all hours. I doubt he could move it at all."*

I wouldn't be able to eat the steak with my hands though. Too many looks. It had to be something else. I fold my arms.

*"But the police couldn't find the rest of the... body in the victim's house." The second woman spoke again. "Just the mess of blood in the kitchen, and..."*

I drop my notepad gently on the table. My neighbour peeks over at it.

*"We've seen the pictures." The balding man. "I agree, though. I think what we have is enough to-"*

"Ribs!" I cry out. It was perfect! "Slow cooked, and falls right off the bone..." I notice eyes on me, and sit back, putting my contemplative mask back on.

*"You..." The balding man starts "You think he cooked that poor girl, and... ate her?"*

*"It makes perfect sense." My neighbour speaks up for the first time. "He was looking at the lunch menu, and the barbecue place might as well have the whole cow on here."*

I feel like I could eat a whole cow.

*"Oh my God..." The young man speaks again. "Yeah, look at the floor near the oven."*

I hear a young woman breathing heavily, and look her way. She seems to be hyper-ventilating. The hunger grows. I purse my lips to keep my saliva in.

*"I'll... I'll be fine." She says. "Thank you."*

*"That's sick..." Says the first woman. "I'm convinced. A monster like that deserves to rot."*

*"Agreed." The young man. "Let's vote."*

The young woman raises her hand. I notice everyone else do the same and follow suit.

The meat was **delicious**, by the way.
