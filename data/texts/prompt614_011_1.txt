I have done it. Everything is set in motion, it took generations of, "myself" to orchestrate the necessary mechanisms to get humanity to this point, but we are here, finally. It all ends today.

I write this letter to whoever remains.

Many of you will die, and over time, will continue to do so. You will not know who among you is me, but as long as someone exists, so will I. And I exist to extinguish you. I take this action, not out of a hatred for humanity. But out of a deep, crushing intangible love for it. And that love, has destroyed me. I am possessed by my will to end my own suffering. Unfortunately the price for this release, is the death of us all. You could not possibly understand why i take this action. But I suppose you could say, I am in a way, the accumulated pain of humanity unleashed. And the guilt of the action i will take, forces me to, i suppose, clear my conscious, by telling you, who i am, and why i will do, what will be known as the begging of the end.

You will find this hard to believe, but among humanity exists an immortal. That immortal is I, and I have been many people. A family man, construction worker, prophet, psychologist, farmer, politician. The list would be a saga in of itself. However those lives, and the details of how I came to be are of little importance on contrast to what will come. Suffice to say I was once just a man, much like any other. I was born, raised, loved, had a family, grew old, and died. In the end, I came to accept this journey from nothing to nothing around my first death. I was content, satisfied and made peace with my regrets. We are born alone and die alone. I was ready, and i did, die. But then i was reborn, again, and again and again. This you must understand, is no "gift". A persons heart, psyche, soul, cannot handle the cumulative pain of endless lovers, children, brothers, sister all dying, and yet, it isn't only the pain of their loss, that haunts me. To a greater degree, it is their life. The sights of my new born children, their warm smiles, the intimate kisses of my various husbands and wives, their warm cheeks and sweet embraces. Even as i write this, their faces enter my mind and the sensation of their touches linger on my skin. All of it and remains, and the pain of their memory sends me into an unfathomable hell. You may argue my pain is selfish. But how could you understand? I do not expect you to, and in time, you will need not worry.

But, you at the least deserve an explanation. It goes without saying, that you cannot be more susceptible to pleasure without being more susceptible to pain. The more your heart is open the more it is vulnerable and it aches at the loss of the experiences it has had. And I, have had many experiences. For a time I learned to shut myself off from pleasure, so as to avoid the eventual infliction of pain. However this is akin to a death in of itself. An emotional death for multiple generations was no remedy. It only allowed me to "function" as a walking corpse. My heart has callused, and nothing remains but the hardened skin. What am i to do? The soul was never "designed" to suffer for this long. And It has driven me madd. You must understand, It is a cruel purgatory to be an immortal. I must have done something terrible to have deserved this. But i have stopped looking for signs. I've attempted to speak to all the gods, done every ritual to find some salvation for my soul, and now I am done. I've seen no signs, received no messages. Maybe this was my purpose. And if it is, then I am fulfilling my destiny. Absorbing the cumulative pain of innumerable lifetimes has destroyed what ever humanity used to exist in me. And now I am death itself. Do not fear me. For I will be your friend, and when I extinguish you, I will try and do so gently. But know, I do this not out of hate, but out of envy, for the release that i cannot have.
