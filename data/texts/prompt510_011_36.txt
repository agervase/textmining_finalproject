Everyone seemed to be avoiding this gorgeous woman, just sitting ***right there***. In the middle of Central Park at the crack of dawn, where normally I found more homeless than I found people I could at least bare to be with, was this veritable goddess of a woman, on a bench, and I felt like I was the only person aware of it. Everyone seemed to walk as far on the sidewalk from her as they could, averting their eyes, avoiding her like the plague. What did everyone else know that I didn't? This was ***New York***, the big apple, and she was treated like a worm crawling out of it. I was supposed to be having breakfast with a few friends before heading to work, but mystery, intrigue, and some primal instinct to approach someone so stunning got the better of me.  I didn't even think to straighten my embarrassingly loose tie, I just walked up, sat down, placed my briefcase full of technical documents, and was locked in my own silence. I couldn't even think what to say. Here I was, in the lions den I'd tossed myself into without even thinking of what I'd do once I got down here.

"You can relax, I don't bite."

Oh thank ***god***, she talked first. I exhaled, turned to face her, and was immediately greeted by the most brilliant, pronounced and... dead eyes I've ever seen. How, I don't know. Everything else was so ***stunning***, she was no older than twenty four, had the body of what supermodels *dream* they could look like, but her eyes. They were the eyes of someone who'd seen things far beyond what people should ever see. And I've seen vietnam vets, strewn on the side of the walkways, withering in their own piss and begging for a few coins. But this woman, she held something behind those milky, grey eyes. Sadly, yet again, I had failed my societal training and had been staring into her eyes for a solid twenty seconds without saying a word.

"So, big guy, what do you see." She asked me. What did I see? Oh man, here was my chance. After this cavalcade of awkwardness, somehow she'd given ***me*** the green light.

"I'll tell you what I see, I see the most gorgeous woman I've eve-"

"No, ***no***. I know what I look like to you. But you didn't spend the last few moments looking up and down. You," she gently touched my nose, "were up here." She pointed towards her own eyes, before lightly resting the tips of her fingers on my cheek. They were surprisingly cold.

"I, well. I didn't see pain, or happiness. I just saw a lot of ***everything***. Like you've been everywhere, and partaken in nothing. I can't really describe it."

She chuckled, and relaxed back a little bit, distancing herself from me. "Interesting. So, can you guess-"

"Why were your hands so cold?" I touched my own cheek, and sure enough, where she'd had her hands was significantly chillier. So it wasn't just a figment of my imagination.

She huffed, "Rude, now. Can you guess what ***they*** see?" She made a discreet motion towards the rest of the people in the park.

"I mean, exactly what I'm seeing. What else?"

"***They***, as most people do, see the ugliest woman they've ever laid eyes on. Can't say I'm surprised, really."

"Woah, ***woah***, but how? Have you been anywhere with even a remotely reflective piece of anything recently? I mean, how could-"

"I guess I can't really act surprised. I would call you dense, but it's not like you'd be able to guess you were talking to death, in any case. To you, I'm just some random person on a bench."

I opened my mouth, she touched my lips, and I quickly shut them again. Any complaints or disagreements I once had were quickly silenced by her frigid skin. Alright, lady, I believe you.

"So," she laughed a little bit, "Why do you see me as such a beautiful woman?"

"Well, I mean. I'm not sure, really-"

"You, ***you***." She interrupted, in a scolding tone. "Stop lying, you think I can't tell when you're stumbling around? You know exactly why, so just tell me."

"Because you'll never catch me."

She stopped. Not slowed down, stopped. Everything about her just *froze*, as if she realized the train was coming and there was nothing she could do to get out of the way. "What?" She murmured.

"You'l never catch me, that's why you're so beautiful. I mean, no wonder all those people would see you as ugly, they're *scared* of you. Because they see you at the end of the road. But I *don't.*" I shifted forward, letting out some steam I'd been keeping pent up ever since I devoted myself to the cause. "I'll spend my *whole life*, not running from you, but *outsmarting* you. You've had everyone since the beginning of time, but you'll never have *me*. I'll be your 'one that got away'. And you want to know why? Because I'll spend the rest of my life making sure I fight you." I pushed the tip of my finger into her chest, and she froze yet again.

"I've spent the last twenty years working towards leaving this mortal coil, into a *machine*, and I have no intentions of stopping now. I'll be my own salvation, not you. While everyone else is fine with their own organic bodies, I'll find a way beyond it. I'll *evolve*. It's why everyone finds you so horrendous, because you're in control of them. But me? I'm in control of *you*. So if you ever want to even get *close* to getting your hands on me, you better hurry. Because time's not running out for me, and it never will be." I stood up, tightened my tie, and walked away. The last look on her face was that of terror, like a person who'd never lost anything had watched something he should have had slip away. A few yards down the sidewalk, I checked over my shoulder, and saw an empty bench. I smiled, and continued on my way to breakfast with my coworkers, to start another day.

I know how I see death. But I wonder how death now sees me.
