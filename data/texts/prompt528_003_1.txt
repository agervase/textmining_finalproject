The boy was confused at why the older gentleman in front of him was watching a football game on his phone, as he sat in the stands of that very same game. He was even more confused when the stream showed a touchdown about thirty seconds before it happened in real life. Confused, the boy leaned in to talk to the gentleman. 
“What do you have there?” He asked.
“It’s an iPhone,” The gentleman replied dryly.
“What model?”
“The 15th.”
“That’s not a thing.”
“It is in a few years.”
“So is time travel, I’m guessing?” The boy asked. 
“Yeah pretty much.”
“...so why are you here?”
The gentleman shrugged. “Bored, I guess.”
“Why are you watching on your phone?”
“It’s higher quality”
“Than real life?”
“Yeah, in the future we have 5K.”
“5K?”
“Yeah. Like 4K us another K. They’re even working on a 6K.”
“That’s a lot of Ks.”
“I know.”
“So you went back in time to watch an old game and then decided to watch it on your phone?”
“Yes.”
“That seems unnecessary.”
“Probably.”
The boy thought for a moment. 
“What’s the future like?”
“Kinda like now, but slightly nicer. Also kind of shittier.”
“That’s very vague.”
“We’ll I can’t tell you everything. That’s illegal.”
“Who enforces that?”
“You know. Time police and stuff.”
“Time police?”
“Yeah. They’re like police but for people who break the laws of time.”
“Are you allowed to tell me this?”
“I mean...” the gentleman said. “It’s kind of like the time equivalent of jaywalking. If I were to tell you that, say, you’re going to die in twelve hours, then that’s like the time travel equivalent of vehicular manslaughter. Or arson.”
“These rules are weird.”
“Yep.”
“So am I going to?”
“Going yo what?”
“Die in twelve hours.”
“Probably not.”
The boy nodded.
“...what’s the time travel equivalent of possession of marijuana?”
“Possession of marijuana.”
“That shits not legal in the future?”
“Sadly not.”
“Why not?”
“Because—“
At that exact moment the gentleman disappeared. The boy stared at the empty space where the gentleman sat, and then, shaking his head in disbelief, continued watching the game, and decided not to think about it.
