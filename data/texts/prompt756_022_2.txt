“I had finally found it. After a lifetime of research and expeditions, with more than a few failed attempts not to mention a few lost appendages in the process.” I stop my narrative and hold up my mangled right hand, which is now not much more than a stump. I lean forward and wink towards the gathered audience of one, and direct my eyeline down towards me feet, where a few more digits are missing, visible through my sandals.

“What happened next?” the young one piped up, his blue eyes looking at me expectantly. Not enjoying the unexpected interruption from the climax of my previously uninterrupted rambling memoir.

“Ahh yes, my apologies” I respond, settling back into my seat, “So there I was, in front of the fountain. I leaned forward and drank from the fountain, its sparkling fluid filling my mouth. Upon swallowing, I felt a change, and then I saw him.”

“Who!?” my audience cannot contain his excitement anymore. I chuckle, brushing some hair out of my eyes.

“Death” I reply simply. That brings quiet and stillness from my astute listener, it’s the reaction that this statement ordinarily brings. I close my eyes and breathe deeply, taking in the smells, the feeling of the room. Upon opening my eyes, I gaze forlornly into the young boy's eyes before continuing.

“He reached out and handed me something, it was this” I pull the card from my pocket, the weight of the metal no lighter than the day it was handed to me. But the responsibilities that now comes with it weigh more than the brushed steel ever could.

“Death spoke to me, His voice echoing through my mind. ‘Call me, once you get tired’, and I did. Many years later, I live for a very long time as you now know. But I did call, He had a job offer for me.” I rise from my seated position, looking down on the small child, so young and innocent, “Which is what brings me here now, to you” I reach out, with my good hand, and touch the child’s head as he slumps back onto his pillow.

“For you”
