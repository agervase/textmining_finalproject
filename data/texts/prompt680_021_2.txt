EXCERPTS OF THE DIARY OF MR. WEIRDO - Cut as short as my crazy imagination could, to save time and space.

**DAY 1 - WHERE THE HECK AM I? - 8/18/2018**

I'm starting this diary because I have not the foggiest idea what the heck is going on.  I wake up this morning wearing what I had on yesterday curled up on what appears to be the sands of my city minus the buildings?  Did god turn the extra features off?  Did "The Donald" royally screw up and get everyone Nuked yet somehow my Apartment was a safe haven from the nuclear blast giving itself to save me?  What the heck is going on here?

Anyway, today was mostly walking this vast thought hauntingly somewhat familiar desert, mile after mile.  Did not run across any signs of life besides snakes, wasps, scorpions....did I die and go to hell!?!? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!!!

Anyway, I spent all day walking to the mountains to the south, and found a nice halcove in them for the night.  I started a fire using my reading glasses to direct the sunlight at the dried up tumbleweed I've collected and some rocks I've spent the last few hours of sunlight collecting.  I've got a nice fire going on.

There's no cell signal.  I still have my car keys, wallet, and phone in my pocket, 2 guitar picks, and $4.00 in cash.

I guess I'm going to have to make do with whatever this crazy circumstance is.  It's a total catch 22....

Should I enjoy it? After all, I never liked people that much, and it is peaceful and quiet, when I'm not narrowly escaping certain injury or death from wildlife and stupid missteps.  I don't really trust people.

I did see some seemingly consistant smoke puffs in the distance leading me to think I'm not in the time period I'm in, conical buildings somewhat resembling teepees were over there.  If I was really sent back in time somehow....god I hope it was not that weird amaglamation of electronic parts I tried to put together into a guitar pedal last week that caused all this.  I should never have bought those weird Army surplus microchips to build a flanger.

Given my current location, and the way my best was facing, if I head what I think is east, I should hit the river from the closest downtown metropolitan area by sunset at worst....

Either way, I'm not sure what the heck has happened to put me in this situation.

**MAY 8TH 1859 - I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON!, RENO, NV**

Remember that morning 3 day ago that started when what I assume was the Calvary came by and wiped out our entire tribe.  Now I have no home, just dead bodies, however, it seems the Washashu  took out a few of the members and so I managed to acquire 3 pistols, a shotgun, some authentic 19th century Cowboy Wear, and a horse I've been nurturing.  I figured out what was going on this morning, I hit a familiar town....well...in name only, Reno, only just reaching a year old since it started.  Well, looks like I'll hang my hat here for awhile, but stay out of the way.

When I came into town, it was May 18th 1859, so I guess somehow I went back in time.  By now it's been so long my entire life in the 21st century looks like a strange fuzzy dream now, like it never happened.  It's also feeling a little weird getting my English dialect.  But I'm getting it back together fairly quickly considering the only English I've done for the last 300-400ish years is in this damn diary.

With this, I have decided to begin a new alias - Justin T. Justice.  Even though I'm older, I'll just say I'm 25 - that way I'm too old to meddle with the timeline, should this be what I truly think it is - time travel - and/or cause a Paradox.  What if all those things the Back to the Future Movies said was true.  I don't want to damage things....though I might, uh, change a FEW things......just a bit once my life starts, in the first quarter of 1983 - which is a LONG time from now.  But I have it all planned out.  I will need to move every few years, to keep myself from being....uh....found out.  So I've made a plan here and plan to follow it....to a T

My current plan, is to pretend to be Justin, then leave town, and change my name again, playing as a man between 25 and 35.

**DECEMBER 1ST 1950 - IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FROM HERE ON OUT**

Okay, I'll let it slip, I was a HUGE Rock music fan, rock, metal, new wave, and the next batch of decades where that stuff is ALL around me.  It's going to be hard, I'm anxious for Leo Fender to finally put his new "Esquire" and a Tweed Harvard out so I can buy one and start playing with some bands again with an electric guitar.  It's been CENTURIES MAN! CENTURIES!   I really need to bite my tongue.  I leave for Fullerton tomorrow, and my 2 weeks notice at the Kelvinator factory is almost up.  Also, time for a name change - time for Justin T. Justice Jr. to rise from the ashes.  Sounds like a rocker name.

But here's my worry.  Because in my 21st century life, I was an average guitarist POST Eddie Van-Halen, post Effects, and POST all that showy technological stuff, I REALLY Need to tone it down for the first few decades or I just might fuck up rock history.  The last thing I need is to dethrone someone and create an alternate timeline because Justin T. Justice Jr. became a successful rock musician, further altering the course of rock history.....and maybe affecting things, negatively.....it's going to get harder as the 80's come too....oh boy.

**SO SCARED I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS, 1994 - NOW I REALLY FUCKED UP - Seattle, WA**

So my band got signed, the FBI found out that there is an "illegal Alien" in the band (ie. Me), and I'm on the lamb from national security.  They found out my Social Security card is invalid, and that Jeffrey Reginald does not exist.  All of my credit cards have been cancelled, my driver's licence invalidated.

I also fucked up big when I gave my REAL SSN to the lady at the bank, hoping maybe I could get away with it.  This lead to a close call with my past self and my mom on the phone, asking HOW I got a 11 year old boy in Georgia's Social Security number.  IM FUCKED!!

But that's not the worst, I just prevented a major event in history - and it's ALL my fault. And it's uncomfortable because the outcome was supposed to be sad.......people, this is the TRUE problem with time travel.

So I was running from agents along lake Washington when I saw a light in a room above a garage that I could lose them through the ivy getting to.  The gate was open.......so was the door. 

I run upstairs and after startling the guy who seemed quite tired, and after a brief interrogation, I recognized who I was talking to, and that I'd just messed up........there is no feeling in my heart or brain that can explain how I feel now.  Did I just make the future better, or worse?  I seemed to distract the guy talking about things like music and such.....

It's really given me some thought that the last 50 years have not been the best, being still my age for 600 years, I am pretty sure I've fucked up even more given what this famous musician told me.....

Somewhere through the conversation, he looked like he'd seen a ghost.  He RECOGNIZED me, said I looked just like every identity I'd been since 1952 - only the "1990's version".  Apparently, the rise in popularity of of underground bands throughout history and looking them up and following them was no stranger to all my previous groups - what's worse, we had names of other garage bands that once existed in the original timeline.  Just by existing, hiding among the populace, I have veered the timeline....

**8/19/2018 - THE END - MIDNIGHT - JUST LIKE BACK TO THE FUTURE**

So today is the day that it all ends, that I finally survived 600 years of reliving America's history from shacking up with Native Americans in the 1400's-1800's, to pilfering cowboys, to wrecking rock history by saving a major icon and becoming an underground rock legend several times over.

Today, I changed my looks a bit, and rented a new apartment across from ours, waiting for the evening around the time I would pass out on my bed, and it would all be over.  

Looking out my window, I watch as my dog Diamond bit the circuit I'd bread boarded, laying the arcing, sparking device on the bed before running out of the room.  Just as the doggy drool touched my toe, I watched my body glow green and then disappear into thin air.   It was like that scene from Back to the Future where Marty watches Doc get shot, and himself go back to 1955.

Now I've been watching the  police outside all day, looking for another life I lived, for 600 years.  They don't suspect a thing, HAHA.
