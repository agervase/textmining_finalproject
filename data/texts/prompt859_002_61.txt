Terrence was today's order. Nigel co-operated and told his former cellmate's current haunts. Two strip clubs and four pubs later, I found him. Air was cold during the day and colder after the sundown. I made my way inside and there he was sitting in front of the bar. I didn't need to see what he was drinking since I already knew his preferred poison was whiskey. No need to be rash I told myself. Terrence was -literally- a killer in his time, but that was four decades ago. He was to be in, in life and in death too, it was decreed after The Haunting. My gun was within reach, but I was not going to need it. I pulled up the chair next to him and waved the bartender to bring me a glass of the same whiskey.

"Terrence, dear friend." I kept my voice steady, with no tone. Even if he was bothered by my presence, he didn't show it. My glass came and raised it towards him and drank.

"Do I have to?" he asked calmly.

"It is not as bad as you think it is. You know the conditions of the prison life. Look man, the sooner you go through this the better. Its only 2 sentences-"

"It will take longer in this state." He interrupted with a cold tone. Bitter, but not hateful.

"State has taken precautions for this. They have mercy. You will be placed in one of the hotter cells so you can do your time quicker. This will not take more than a decade. You get this treatment because of good behaviour. After that, you will walk."

He finished his drink with slow and long gulps. Dead people don't get drunk after all.

"I tried to feel alive but I feel nothing. How do you keep going?"

I smiled. He saw reason, got my point.

"Purpose."

We walked out of the pub and to my car. I didn't cuff him. An hour later and I dropped him off at the district and proceeded to my next fugitive.

Dead people don't get tired after all.
