Twenty-one years ago, I was born with an unusual superpower. By tapping somebody on their shoulder, I could always make them turn and look over that shoulder.

The superpower seemed innocuous; like it would serve no practical use outside of playing pranks. That was until I had inadvertently tapped both shoulders and killed my girlfriend.

That fateful day was still etched vividly into my brain, and now two years later I stood trial; accused of murdering her.

I was called to the stand and asked to reconstruct the events that unfolded for the jury. In excruciating detail, I explained how my girlfriend and I were getting intimate and she asked me to give her a massage. She took her bra off and lay on her stomach while I sat astride her, pouring massage oil on her back and rubbing it into her; starting with her shoulders.

As I massaged the oil into her, I saw that she was not responding at all, and after trying to get a reaction out of her, I realised that she was lifeless and that she had actually died.

In a panic, I called 911 and within minutes the police were at my door and were immediately suspicious that I had killed her. They handcuffed me and took me away to the station where I was interrogated and eventually charged with murder.

I didn't explain the part about my superpower to make people look over their shoulder. That would've been too farfetched. Besides, after what happened, I wanted to keep that secret to the grave.

Thankfully, despite the best efforts of the prosecution to paint me as a murderer, they found no evidence that I had actually inflicted any kind of harm to her. What they actually found in the autopsy was baffling. Her brain had suffered significant burns - which I immediately interpreted as me overloading her brain by touching both her shoulders.

I was again called to the stand the next morning, after the jury had reached their verdict.

"We find the defendant, Mr John Holmes, not guilty!"
