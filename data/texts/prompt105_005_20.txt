A glimmer of sweat ran down from my eyebrow as they drew the blood from my arm. The small prick that could lead to life behind bars, or walking away from it all was about to enter my skin. And I didn’t know which one it was going to be. This better work, I thought to myself as the nurse prepared the small vials. I shifted a bit in my seat, glancing around at the bright white walls surrounding me. My sentence or release was a mere minute away. I felt a sting in my arm. The nurse had started. As much as I wanted to know, I had to look away. Even if my freedom was on the line, I still couldn’t stand the sight of blood. I waited a few seconds, and suddenly I felt the needle pull out. It was over. What now? Before I had a chance to react, I felt the straps came undone that had been over me. “You’re good to go,” The nurse said. A rush of euphoria filled me as I began to stand up. I did it. I am the first person to get away with murder in over thirty years. I acted cumbersome as I stumbled out of the hospital. Left and right police were apologising to me, and I couldn’t help but trip over my words as I walked free. I exited the hospital, and it was there that I remembered what I had to do now. I was in debt. My stomach dropped.

Two weeks after my release- The dye had worked according to plan, and I was back to living my normal life. Things were simple. I made my meals, did my chores, and went to work. Still, in the back of my mind, I knew things would soon change drastically. I also knew that in exchange for that dye, I had also sold my life. It was worth it. There’s no telling what would have happened to me in prison. See, since they can check a person’s blood, and determine their guilt 100%, that person becomes worthless to them. They mangle, torture, and starve them with no remorse. All a prisoner is, is the crime they committed. I checked my watch, 1530. I was supposed to meet my dealer that night.
