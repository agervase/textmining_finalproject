"I am the Fuhrer. I demand you release me."

"And you've been a bad boy, Adolf," I whispered in his ear. "I'm here to punish you."

He looked around the hotel room. Strapped to the bed, he cut a pitiful figure. I could see a change come over him and his mustache started to quiver.

"Who are you?"

"Annabel Goldschmidt," I said.

"You're a Jew." He was suddenly accusatory, and suddenly afraid. "Is that why why you're here?"

"Well, yes and no, honey. I'm a collector. I collect dictators. And I have to say-" I glanced down at where his trousers had been, "-compared to Stalin and Mao, you just don't measure up, baby."

The trail of his clothes from the hotel room door to the bed told a sorry story. Sometimes a girl disappoints.

"I'm sorry," he said. Gotta give credit to the man, he almost sounded contrite.

"Sorry ain't good enough, babe."

I took a long drag of the cigarette and blew the smoke into his face. He coughed, and tried to move his face away. I slapped it back.

I double-checked the GoPRo to make sure it was still recording. My YouTube followers were going to love this one.

"What are you doing," he asked, as I poured the oily liquid into a geometric pattern with him at the center.

"Lubing you up, baby," I said.

"Please..."

"This is for you, granny," I whispered. I flicked the stup of the cigarette onto his body, and the flaming swastika engulfed him. His screams grew and I stepped out into the hall.

A Gestapo officer was running towards me. "Hey, whore, stop. What have you done to the Fuhrer?" He started to raise his revolver.

"Oh, I think he got what was coming to him," I said. I twisted the dial on my time watch, and disappeared just as the bullets started to fly.
