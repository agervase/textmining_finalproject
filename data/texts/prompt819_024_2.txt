Gred opened the door to his home. It was late.

He carried in his hand a manila envelope. Casey knew what it was.

"You don't have to do it, you know." She said as he took off his coat and hung it on the hook on the door. "We'll find our way, there's no need."

It was quiet. Listening carefully, Greg could hear the slow drip from the bathroom upstairs. He could hear the shaky compressor on the fridge he had bought decades ago. He passed his wife and went into the kitchen to open the fridge. He pulled out a bottle of light beer, the last in the rack.

"134,000." Greg said.

Casey gave a low whistle and sat on the couch across the room. "Who?"

"Some guy, recently lost his job, history of mental health, kills his entire family, then himself. Note said it would be better than having to move his family to subsidized housing. I can't say I would do the same, but I don't blame him."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. I guess this is the price I pay for not liking violence."

Years ago, The United Nations announced a new law. An incentive for us all to be decent to each other. Nobody could have expected the next few years.

"They say it's simple. All I have to do is push a button. They never actually tell you you're killing them, did you know that? They say, "Here take this money and just come push this big red button, the rest is already all set up in some other room. The only reason I know who I'm killing is because they put upcoming capital sentences in the paper."

"There's always another way out of this."

"No, there isn't"

Greg drove down to the prison the next morning. He walked in the front door, told the guard why he was there, and sat down in a small waiting room lit by fluorescent lights that hummed at a frequency right on the edge of his perception. There was nobody else in the room. He sat quietly in this way for the better part of an hour, before the guard came in and told Greg to follow him. He was led to a room with a mirror on one wall and a camera in the corner, pointed at a simple metal table with 3 chairs, two one one side, one on the other. There was a small red button on the table. 2 men in suits entered, sat down, and said, "Whenever you're ready."

Greg pushed the button.

Greg drove himself home. He entered his house, went to the kitchen, and opened his computer. He found his half finished resume, a standard template under the new U.N. On it, he checked the box that said "Homicide Pass Utilized"

Greg finished his application, sent it to the organizations on his list, and cried.
