I was drawing up a new display plan for next week's Festival Specials when Lothar walked in. 

"How can I help you, Lothar?"

He tossed down a set of severely mangled bracers. "I need some new ones. That bastard warg chewed mine up pretty good last night."

"Sure thing, there should be a set in your size on the shelf just over there," I pointed. He moved over to the pile of bracers and started digging through.

"Can I get them dyed to match the rest of my armour?" he asked.

"Sure can. You want that instead of the guild discount this time?" I have a sponsorship deal with the various martial guilds in town. For the Fighter's Guild, they receive a nominal discount that scales with their rank, which can be substituted for alternative services at mutual discretion.

"That would be great. We got a good bounty for the warg, but between Guild fees and upkeep, there's not much left over. Plus, it my anniversary today, so I'd like to take Talia out and about, treat her real nice."

"Oh, happy anniversary my friend! This calls for something special - tell you what, come with me into the store room, I've got something you might like."

Lothar enters the store room as I'm struggling to pry off the lid of a crate. "Here, let me," he says, reaching down. He grips the edge of the lid with one hand, the crate with the other, and pops the lid off like nails didn't even exist.

"Thanks Lothar. Now, take a look at these," I say, handing him a pair of fine leather boots. "What do you think? Would Talia like them?"

"Oh wow. Jeez Rowan, these are perfect!" He looks them over again, eyeing the tassels and the intricate beadwork on the uppers. Excitement shone in his eyes. "How much?"

I grinned. "A gift! From me to you, and to Talia of course."

"Rowan, I can't just accept these..." he starts.

"Of course you can, Lothar. It is a gift, from one friend to another. Please, I insist."

"Well... thank you. Friend." Lothar looks positively sheepish. "Now, back to those bracers..."

After finishing with Lothar and planning for next week's Festival Specials, I locked up the shop and headed for lunch. The Travelling Gooseberry Tavern is usually the place to eat, but today, I had somewhere else to be, so I had packed some food into a small backpack. I headed out into the woods, travelling the main road until the lightning-blasted tree. From there, I turned into the woods, and picked out a faint trail towards Eoward's Well. As you know, Eoward's Well was abandoned some time ago, after a pox had taken Eoward and most of his family, leaving behind the ghost of a farm and an empty well. The empty well is a surprisingly good delivery spot. Simply send down the items in the old bucket and walk away. And if anyone asks why I'm taking supplies out there, I just say I'm disposing of unusable materials.

I settled into the shade beside the barn, a neat little place where I could see the abandoned farm yard but couldn't be easily seen myself. I was half way through the first apple when I caught the first rustle in the grass from beside the house. A crow sounded twice, then a small mottled green humanoid figure slid into view. I whistled a fair imitation of a sparrow, then stepped out into the yard.

"Hello, Grimmtooth, what business have we today?" I asked

"Rowan," said the goblin, "we come to talk ammunitions. We needs more."

"Very well, the usual bundles of arrows?"

"Yes, and bolts too. We taken five crossbows from humans."

I start. "Crossbows? I don't  - Where did you get those?" 

"Said, taken from humans. They tries to raid camp, so we fights back. They die and we taken crossbows and stuff. Good eating for days."

This is troubling. You can't take a goblin camp with crossbows, they take too long to reload. Best you'll get is one shot each before the goblins scramble into melee - maybe two, if you're proficient.

Even more worrying - I don't stock crossbows. Seems there's some new competition in the area.

"Grimm, I can get you the arrows, no problem. Bolts, though - they *are* a problem."

"Gots no problems before, why problem now, Rowan?"

"Well, Grimm - I don't sell crossbows. Never have, and don't even have a supplier for them. Therefore I have no bolts, either."

"How we gonna shoot with no bolts?"

"Guess you'll have to take them off corpses. In the meantime, I can get your arrows. Anything else?"

"No, arrows have to do. When?"

"A week. In the well, as usual." 

*************************************************************************

As I head back to town, my mind is a hive of activity. Someone is arming adventurers with crossbows, and sending them after the goblins. Who? Where are they sourcing the crossbows? This could upset the balance I've been working toward - giving both monsters and adventurers even odds at winning by arming both sides. I need to find this new arms dealer. But how?

The Guilds. They should know if another dealer is in the area. So now I need to talk to Lothar - but no, not tonight. Tonight I need to start assembling bundles of arrows. And besides, I wouldn't want to spoil Lothar's anniversary.
