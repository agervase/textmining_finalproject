The answer: Obviously• Trying to get me?• Pathetic, do you see?• While I am eating Imma better rapper than you will ever be• Everything that I say transforms into fire• can some try and defend you? Not even a lawyer• Your music is cold like a yeti• are you for real boy? You ain't gonna beat me singing 'bout spaghetti.•
