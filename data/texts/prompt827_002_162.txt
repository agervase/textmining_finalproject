They were shorter than expected. That's really all that could be said, because it was just about all anyone could consistently remember. Short, androgynous, with no stand-out features... at all. No skin tone; logically they must have had a skin tone but nobody could ever fully agree on what it was. No hair colour either, at least not one that anyone could ever summarise as being other than "um, well I guess it was probably brown but now you mention it?" Hell, not even any kind of apparent sex or gender, just a general pervasive feeling of someone Being There. 

But by the gods that sense of Being There was strong. It was almost as though, they were the ONLY real thing in the room, that even your own self was just a slightly more tangible form of ghost beside this absolutely definite force that stood in a rough hemp tunic and whistled dryly from some long-dead melody. 

**So?**

Everyone jumped. The task force operator stepped forwards, twirling his hat vaguely in his hands. It was a good hat, everyone agreed, but right now it felt like smoke and dreams for all the good it might have done. 

"We can't stop them. They're going to annex our entire solar system and we can't fucking stop them. Fusion bombs didn't scra-"

A hand was before his face. It hadn't been raised; everyone in the room had an utterly unshakable knowledge that it had _always_ been there, since time immemorial. Whether that was true or not was beside the point.

**What exactly do you expect us to do about it?**

"Something! Anything! We... we were told you would help, in-"

**A time of catastrophic peril.**

The words didn't seem to travel through the air, as much as they seemed to have *always have been travelling*, and only now were you hearing them. It was rather like listening to the echoes of water underground, if subterranean rivers sounded like 18 billion mouths speaking as one. None of them the same but somehow all of them meaning the same, and nobody in the room was left in any doubt as to the message. Certainly it wasn't heard by everyone in the native tongue; rather, nobody heard it at all, but felt the message as though it had been carved into their skulls since birth, only now to be read. 

"I uh... um... yes." It seemed anticlimactic. Was this not the time for great persuasive speeches? But before this person- or was it more than one? It wasn't clear. Before this presence, persuasion seemed not only impossible, but laughable. It would be like bluffing against a champion poker player with a nervous tic. It seemed almost insulting.

**Why.**

"Because we can't fight this on our own" came a stiff, almost paper-scratched voice from the back, that strode with utter conviction towards the podium. Nobody stopped her; it was entirely likely that nobody could. She was thin, and tall, and seemed the only person in the room beside That One who had any real solidity at all. Her eyes visibly focused and unfocused as they looked upon Them, but they stayed in one place, which was certainly no ordinary achievement. Perhaps it came from working with artificial intelligences for the last 80 years of her rather extended life; when one regularly deals with a mind without a singular body, is it so hard to comprehend a body without a singular mind? 

**You have fought before.**

"We have fought ourselves before. We have fought You before. We have never fought outside." Her voice, now so close to the impenetrable Solidity of the presence, seemed reedier now, a solo recorder against a philharmonic orchestra, but she could still be heard through the psychic thronging.   
"We have no idea how to fight that which is not our own. You do."

Even against the deafening sound of impenetrable psychic nothingness, the intake of air was audible. Dr. Miller continued, sweating slightly but standing firm, voice picking up the almost imperceptible volume of her audience's belief and running madly into the storm with it.

"You have fought the mammoth and the wind. You have fought the night and the locust. You have fought the cold and the heat. You have fought the mindless and the minded and you have always won."

The entity did not pause. It was not entirely clear if such an action could be possible in the realms of reality. However, they did not reply immediately. It was as though, impossibly... they were choosing their words.

**We have sustained heavy casualties.**

"You have always won."

**Pyrrhic victories, many of them.**

"Victories, nonetheless."

**The cost will be unimaginable.**

"The alternative would be fatal."

They paused once more, staring directly into Sue's eyes with the intensity of a mist-formed dagger. The putrid stench of ammonia filled the air, and her loose culottes began to darken to the brown of waterlogged wood. All eyes but her own turned downwards, as the piss ran down her legs. 

She did not tremble. 

The entity turned, slowly, to face the back wall of the room, and made a gesture that might be described as simultaneously wondrously elegant, and horrifically obscene. The walls faded around them, still present... yet so utterly unreal against the solidity of this creature that they had the texture of stiff fog. The eyes of every member of the room, every inhabitant of the town nearby, every citizen of China, every newborn baby looked up into the sky as one. 

**Very well.**

And they were gone.

It didn't take long for the various intelligences of the rest of the universe to get in touch. An entire system demolitions fleet evaporating into protostellar clouds of its component atoms tends to spread around, especially in a system with no obvious weapons capability beyond simple fusion bombs - and firing one of those against a planetary demolition craft would be like throwing eggs at a volcano. Questions were asked, and answers were given - nobody knew anything, and if they did nobody was telling. Hypotheses were raised by the best and brightest of the universe's minds; blazar pulses, gravity anomalies, warpdrive failure, sudden mass hysteria.

Sue rested quietly in the back of her old ute, imported from Australia before globalisation had given way to universalisation, and looked up into the sky. There were new lights there of course; warp gates gave off a lot of power, but they were far enough away that they simply made pretty green lights as their photons rebounded like electromagnetic pinballs through the Earth's atmosphere. She knew nobody would remember her part in things... and that was probably best, she considered. Being the only human to stand up to the gestalt consciousness of the entire history of humanity was, at best, a mixed blessing, and she didn't much like writing memoirs in any case. The sudden end to scarcity afforded by every single power in the known universe handing over... well, anything they had to make the nasty humans go away had led to a necessary end to capitalism (why buy anything when everything is free?), so wealth wasn't actually an incentive, and her AIs were all the company she'd ever actually desired anyway...

She did wonder, sometimes, why no other race seemed to have gestalts. She'd programmed some weak AIs to simulated worlds, of course, after she'd regained her motor functions, and they seemed to form something LIKE a gestalt just fine... but that was probably because she was a human, writing code with a specific goal in mind. The answer seemed to lie in the same reason why other races didn't have capitalism themselves. They didn't really have socialism, either, just a sort of pervasive not-exactly-anarchy that made them at once very powerful and very weak. They had no desire to grow bigger than they were; they had no _optimism_. Everything just... was, to them. 

Ultimately, Sue concluded... she didn't really care. She sipped her mocktail and smiled slightly into the sky.

_Hello universe... Humanity's coming..._
