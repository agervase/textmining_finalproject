It's no effort at all, really. What better way to remain undetected than to leave the place better than I found it?

Sure, that usually means sweeping up my footsteps, and if one floor is cleaner than the other, now that's just suspicious. Gotta sweep the whole house, no doubt. And you can't be having squeaky doors, that's just unprofessional. Even saw a little kid once, out cold on the couch one winter night - couldn't have him wake up and rat me out, right? So I carried him to his bed, made sure to tuck him in as well. Gotta make sure he don't wake up.

O'course, I started tucking in all the folks I found after that. Just became a habit, really.

Don't even get me started on the garages. Far too many tools to accidently kick in the darkness, get myself caught - and once you've cleaned the garage, you might as well do a couple more rooms, right? Can't have it looking out of place. And all these houses, they're really just a couple rooms, no more. Usually less.

You know, before, I'd usually just take a bit of money, maybe something valuable that wouldn't be missed. All the other towns, folks could afford it. 

But this town, the poverty all around...

No, I'll just take a bit of food if there's extra, maybe an old shirt if mine's starting to show through. 

Really, I've managed to buy a few odds and ends, sneaking in a couple things it looks like they need. These people have so little - and a little more always helps, I guess.

Strange enough, I don't really need to look for anything I need no more. Every house I go to, there's something out in the open, waiting for me. A home cooked meal. An old pair of shoes. Even a knitted jersey, bit too small, but it just felt like it was made *for* me, you know? 

I don't know. The state they live in, I don't know what they'd do without me.

Although, come to think of it, I don't know what I'd do without *them.*
