Dear son,

I get a nickel every time I state a false fact. If I say ‘pigs can fly’, then I find a nickel. You could also say that I follow the phrase: ‘If I had a nickel every time I was wrong, I’d be a millionaire.’

Well, I’d later in life decide to take that phrase literally. After thoroughly thinking about that phrase in my late teens in a non-sarcastic way, I began my slow progression towards wealth by saying wrong answers to questions and state false facts whenever I could. Within a few years, I had thousands in the bank.


The next part, I have to thank my old personal finance teacher for teaching me about (you should pay attention in those classes too!). I put all those thousands into an account and kept it there. It would later grow more and more as years went by while I kept the habit of putting nickels inside of it from time to time. 


I’m now in my early fifties and owner of a large company stationed in Los Angeles, although you’re going to be taking over the business. You’ve already begun following in my footsteps, what with your little perk being that you find a penny every time you’re right.

So, I write in this to end my reign as head of the company. My son, if you *do* read this, this is my advice to you: Don’t let your perk give you a big head. Just because you get money when you’re right, doesn’t mean you can always be right. Take a look at your old man. I get a nickel whenever I’m wrong. And even though I’ve been wrong most my life, being wrong brought this family where it is now. That’s key for the business. Realize that, and you’re good to go. 

Good luck, Mr. President.
