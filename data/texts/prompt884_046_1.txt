Blackness. That's all I can seem to remember. Blackness and the constant stream of gravel slowly grating away at my head with no way to move my body bound in rope.

"You fellas just don't learn, do you?" The unrelenting force finally announced. "First you break into MY home, lay your filthy self upon my daughter, and have the nerve to take her life when you can't handle what you've done?"  


I can't answer. I'm not sure if he want's me to answer. In hindsight, I fully deserve whatever is going to happen.

"What makes you think I'd stand for this anymore after my wife? After my son? After my fucking dog!?"  


Wait, I never touched anyone else. I didn't even see anyone else.

He stopped. I felt the lower half of my body hit the ground. It's solid, cold, and hard. I hear a large metal door close. What little light I could take in from behind my covered eyes was now gone. A PA system crackles to life. It's him.

&#x200B;

"Now, All y'all are in here for one reason or another..." He begins, followed by the sounds of hundreds of muffled screams. All seem to be coming from mouths stuffed with something, cloth perhaps. "And frankly, I don't even care anymore. Before you ask, no you ain't getting any food. This is the last time you will hear from me until the next unlucky soul who thinks they can just waltz into my life and start messing the whole place up."  


The PA goes quiet and the muffled screams grow louder and more frantic. I'm going to die in here. This is it. Why did I let my hormones get the best of me. Was I really that desperate for anything. Was any of this even worth it.   


I promise, God. I'll do whatever it takes to change. Please. Oh God please, don't let it end like this.

I could keep thinking like that, but I know the point is moot. I fucked up, and now here I am.
