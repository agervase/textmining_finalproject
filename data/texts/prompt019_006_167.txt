"Ah, isn't the scent of peace wonderful," I said as I stood in front of my open window. The sunrays imbued me with their tender heat, it reminded me of a hug brimming with love.

I went to the kitchen, stretching as I walked down the stairs. The scent of freshly made hotcakes swirled into my nostrils, drawing a smile on my face. I felt *good.* Everything was alright.

"Honey, someone left a box for you. It's on the table," my wife said, carrying the pile of hotcakes toward the table. When we crossed paths, she kissed me. How did I manage to find such a lovely woman? I still don't have the slightest clue.

"A box? Wonder what it contains," I said, rubbing my chin. "Maybe is an enormous letter! Or maybe is an evil plan from one of my foes."

I bolted and opened it. It had no sender, just my name wrote clumsily in a white label. A weird feeling of confusion swarmed my insides when I saw that there were two old and torn newspapers. *1985 and 1986 that's like... yes, old,* I thought and set my eyes on the front cover.

**1985**

*Dr. Mindwiper is plunging the word into chaos by inserting fake memories in the minds of heroes. He's unstoppable and the fate of society seems to be heading his wayâ€”towards destruction. Only one heroine remains, Kissladan yet she's nowhere to be seen.*

*Are we doomed? Is this the end of everything as we know it?*

**1986**

*Dr. Mindwiper dictatorship came to an end. Kissladan turned him to the good side, the side of peace and prosperity. Using her signature move, the Kiss of Kissladan she reprogrammed Dr. Mindwiper's brain completely. As long as the effect doesn't wear off, society is saved.*

---------------------------------

*I'm Dr. Mindwiper,* I thought and squinted, eyes set on my wife. *Did she? It can't be, is she Kissladan?*

"What's wrong honey?" she said and sat in front of me. Her blue eyes drowned into mine and I blushed like a child.

I set the newspaper aside, I was happy. "Nothing sweetie, just a bad prank."
