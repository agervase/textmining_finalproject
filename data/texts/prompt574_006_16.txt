*this can't be happening. God what the hell.*

A series of expletives and theories bounced around my head as I sat in the back of the blackhawk helicopter, besides two burly SWAT operators covered in their deep black body armor and a solemn demeanor. An African American man in a crisp blue suit and an American flag pin sat across from me, staring. It was only 30 minutes ago I was an entry-level accountant sitting in my living room playing Halo and drinking bud light...but now? I don't know what will become of me.

The man the suit spoke up in a deep, determined tone as he plopped a file on my lap, the cover filled with the picture of a man, in full tactical gear, holding a gun to a women's head...my girlfriend's head.

"Tell us everything you know about Jeff"

**Friday January 11 11:55pm**

*I really fucking hate this map*

 I thought to myself as I grabbed another beer from the fridge and plumped down on the couch, resigned to another lazy Friday night. My girlfriend wanted a date night tonight but I turned down her midweek proposal. Obviously it hasn't gone over well since she has yet to talk to me again. But after 50 hours in the office I just needed to rewind.

Plus it was the 3rd anniversary of it.

As the memories started to flow back I looked over to the family picture resting on the old oak side-table to my left. Myself, girlfriend mother and older brother Jeff all posing at Niagara Falls. Taken around 5 years ago at the end of Jeff's last deployment with the army. He had just come home, still in his crisp fatigues and proud of the green sling he had over his left arm from what he said was a training accident.

Then, just as quickly as he came home, two years later he left. No note. No evidence. Just gone. FBI ruled it a suicide but I *knew* its not in his nature to do that...especially without saying goodbye. I have kept trying, I never gave up. I always assumed something must have happened, something he didn't want us to know. After 3 years, however, hope comes sparingly.

**BANG**

My reminiscing was interrupted by a flash of light, a loud deafening bang and the sounds of feet rushing in. Black figures came and surrounded me, screaming military-like orders.

*The cops? No.. SWAT?? FUCK*

As my senses returned I realized several things. There were 10 heavily armed and armoured soldiers in the room surrounding me, whom I can only assume as police given their lack of insignia and the fact I'm not dead. Six directly covered me, like a shield while 4 others took up positions around the room. 

As the initial chaos died down I began to open my mouth to question the situation. The biggest, and one in charge apparently spoke out.

"Shut. The Fuck. Up."

The man was 6'8" of muscle, his blue eyes piercing mine when he said that. It was clear they were not afraid to hurt me. A second SWAT member came back, his hand on a bluetooth microphone in his helmet. He was talking to someone, with urgency in his voice.

"Uh huh, yup target secure. Ready for Exfil. Over and out" 

The man gave the rest of the squad a nod as the large one ziptied my hands and put me on my feet. The subtle sounds of a helicopter's decent accompanied his next words and sly smile.

"Here They Come"
