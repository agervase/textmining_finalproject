“But…. You’re beautiful.”

“I’m not.”

“Yes, you are. You said you’re Death and everyone else is recoiling from you because of how they perceive death. How can anybody think about death as an ugly thing? How?”

“Because dying is ugly. You born, you live and you die, most of time on the edge of something better, on the edge of a better tomorrow or in the middle of your life, full of dreams and plans for the future, full of ‘I want to do this’, ‘I want this’. Most of times, death is unexpected.”

You open your mouth to speak, but quickly close it when you fall deep in thought, thinking about what she said.

Death isn’t an abstract concept. It’s a bone and flesh person concept. You think about all the times you flirted with death, about how you wanted to end your life so badly because everything was going wrong and you had absolutely no hope for tomorrow or yourself. You look outside, seeing the colorful landscape quickly going by while the train rattles in a gentle curve along the cliff.

“When I tried to meet you, did you convince me it was too early?”

“I’m sorry, what?” – She asks confused.

“I tried to kill myself once. I never understood what made me change mind. I used to think it was my unconscious trying to survive. Was it you?”

“Huh… I don’t know. Maybe it was. I visit too many people and I’m visited by too many people every day.”

You nod and then you go back to your world of thoughts. 

You keep thinking about what she said, on eternal rewinding and playing. 

“Aren’t you curious to know why I find you beautiful, breathtaking, out of this world?”

“You aren’t the first human to say this to me. Most of them were suicidal or out of their mind.”

“Hmm… What about the rest? You said most. Not all.”

“The rest? Well, they were humans. It can be a lot of things.”

You look at her, soaking in the details. How the nose is perfectly curved, how her smile is perfect, how her mouth’s color is deep red, her hair is a wonderful red that from times to times will shine just in the perfect way, looking like autumn.

“I know why I find you beautiful. Death is an interesting paradox. It’s the ending, but the beginning at the same time, it’s also about an opportunity to forget life and time, but also to appreciate life and time. You are also the painful truth about life. Everything must end before starting again. At the same time death is the opposite of life, it’s also a part of it. See? The paradox just keeps getting more and more complex and full of interesting details.”

You pause, looking at the landscape taking a deep breath in, before continuing. You can feel the wind in your face, almost painful but still pleasant, smell the grass, feel the subtle warmth of the sun in your body.

“Can I ask something of you?”

“Yes, of course.”

“Will I see you again?” 

She smiles before answering.

“Yes, you will. My duty will never end and your life cycle neither.”

You nod, happy with the answer and then all you can see and feel is the darkness.
