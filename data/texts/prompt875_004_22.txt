This time was different. I heard the screams. The rushing of the emergency vehicles. Like time stood still. All I did was pace. Bar the doors from the inside. Lock them. My daughter was gone, too far to reach. I kept calling. She never answered. This wasn't like her. She had to be dead.

I still hear sounds outside. Cars. People. I know this time is different. They're walking corpses, forced to follow some programming I'm unaware of. I've stayed quiet. They cannot know I'm here. I can last for a long time. It's been a week already, the power is off, but I have cans of food.

Then I hear it. A sound of frustration and confusion. Things being pushed away from the door as someone pushes in. I grab my gun, I'm scared but I wait anyway. If I stay quiet, it can't get me.

"Dad?"

It sounds like her. I try to peek from the window and catch a bit of her blonde hair as she shoves into the house. How did she get back? 

"I'm back from the trip, are you here? Why did you block the door?"

I almost answer, but resist. I know this is a trick, but it sounds so normal. A somewhat scared tone, but gentle and almost musical. Soothing. How could this be? Microchips, virus, mind control? She sounds just like herself. Then I hear shuffling as she moves more into the house. It's gentle at first and then it increases into almost frantic shuffling. The sound moves from the front door, to the living room to almost the kitchen.

"Dad?! Where are you?!"

I hear her run through the house. Barging in doors, throwing them open haphazardly. I hear her screaming for me, things getting knocked over in her frenzy. I sob softly, hand moving to my mouth, cursing my weakness. That isn't her anymore.

"Dad? Are you there?!"

The doorknob jingles a little, then more. I watch the door get tugged in a moment of strength. 

"Dad, I heard you. Please open the door!"

Scared. She's scared. I hesitate... no, that's what it wants me to think. The shade of my daughter. Whatever it is now. It has to have my scent now... it knows I'm here.

"Go away," I yell as I move to load the gun, "I'm not letting you in. Don't make me do this!"

It starts crying, inhaling as it starts slamming at the door. I hear her hiccuping sobs and the sound of her fist being slammed into the wood. I go to warn her to not hurt her hands, but what good would that do now?

"Dad please!! I saw the bottle, didn't uncle Jerry come by?!"

I stop. Would a zombie know that? How would it? I remember that, him coming by. Dropping off food and medicine. I remember giving him money for the bills. I got distracted after he left. I wanted to finish working. I move to the door and stop, hearing a shout from the neighbor. It brings me back to my situation. It's trick. It has her memories.

She screams and sobs. I hear the panic in her voice. It's voice. It claws it begs. She was all I had left. Now all she is, is just a monster. I bring up the gun to the door. I know her height. All I have to do is pull the trigger.

"Please." 

I hear the 'please' through the sobs, like a rattle. I feel dizzy. The prospect of hurting her even as she is now is too much. My mind is fighting itself as I move the gun, pulling it back. I hear sniffling, her sobs making her words almost unintelligible. 

"Daddy, I love you. Please open the door. It's okay. You're confused. I was gone so long, I'll never leave again. I'll quit the team, I swear."

I hear the love. I do. I know it's from parts of her. Whatever is left inside of what she's become. I can't do it. Can I? What is left?

"We'll get help again, daddy. Please. Just let me in."

I hear a beep. She's using her phone? She mumbles, I worry its a trap so I don't go close. Her mother died. My parents are gone. My brother is undoubtedly dead. She is... was the only ray in my life. Either she starves... or I do.

"Daddy, please. I love you. Please let me in."

I raise the gun. It's her or me.

"... I love you too."

I pull the trigger.
