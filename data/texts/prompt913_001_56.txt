Most memories of life are lost to the passage of time when you die. Raw instinct is eventually all that's left over. One could call it irony that Satan, who led a rebellion against The Trinity, would one day have a rebellion on his hands. And, like his first battle so many thousands of years ago, Satan lost this one... dethroned from his own hell.

The man sitting on the throne had used every means possible and was selected to be the dictator of hell. He had followed along in his living footsteps, accomplishing a goal nearly beyond his reach. This had infuriated Satan to no end. But, Satan eventually had bidden his time, as he always has. Waiting for opportunities was his strong suite. The ruler's grasp of command had begun to weaken, and the Prince of Lies sensed an opportunity.

The odd thing about heaven is that people can come and go. Being a paradise means that the purest of wishes can be upheld; a strong desire to return to earth can be granted. Satan always kept an eye out for people who wanted to leave heaven, for obvious (if not misplaced) reasons. After long wait, he had found his Trojan Horse.

Placing someone from heaven into hell is like placing catnip into a community of cats. They draw to it, surround it, embrace it. The new dictator of hell reacted no differently to the new arrival. The stage had been set. Satan grinned in anticipation; there are perks to being an angel with perfect memory.

The Trojan Horse had sensed the unrest in the dictator's ranks. He felt an irresistible urge to help them overthrow him. As instinctively as the new ruler of hell had risen to glory, he too was acting. In the final moments, as the peons turned against their new master, a moment of recognition danced across the dictator's mind. A memory of a life long passed, almost a vapor of a dying cloud.

The memory flashed to sudden life, as the man from heaven also struck at the ruler. "Et tu, Brute?"
