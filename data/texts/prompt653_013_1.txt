"You've seen... so much..."
She let that sentence trail off in to nothingness.
"You know so much, too-" I pulled her into a hug before she finished. Though I'd only known her for 3 years, I adored her like nothing else. As I held her close, I began to list off every possible explanation into her ear. "My hair could age separately from me. It could have been dyed or painted, somehow... or it..." I trailed off when I saw the contemptuous look on her face.
I wasn't coming up with explanations.
I was pleading for my life with the universe.
I looked long into her eyes, and dreamt of the past, even as the tears began to streak down her face.
------------------------------------------------
I looked up at another (albeit younger) teary-eyed face above mine.
I recognized the memory in an instant.
"Holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck ho-"
I'm okay... I'm *hrrk* fine... I just needed to lay down for a second, I- *hrrrrrrrk*"
"Your legs, they-"
I blinked three times, drawing blood into my eyes.
"What's wrong?" I forced a smile through the broken teeth and numbed flesh.
"You got hit b-by a truck..."
Oh.
"Your legs are t-twisted and mangel- hello, 911?"
She stood up to speak with the operator.
I almost passed away, but a thought then hit me like how imagine the truck had;
for the thousands of years that I had lived, I was mortal.
The jaws of that sabertooth tiger, so long ago...
the concentration camp... 
and now this;
I could feel that I was a mortal. That despite my long life, death was hand hovering low above my soul.
"911 is on it's way, just h o l d  t  i  g  h . . ."
I passed out.
------------------------------------------------
"Death is inescapable." I finally conceded. "Is this how it feels to be mortal?"
"Yes, but don't think about it too much. It could be worse."
"How!?" I said, incredulous at the thought. "How could it possibly be worse!?"
The same face from 3 years ago looked up at me, not tearing up but full of resolve. 
"To be mortal is to be on a timer; and with precious little time, every second counts."
She continued,
"The time I spend with you..." she drew me into hug through the front of my wheelchair.
"Is all the more important."
I kissed her as I began to weep.
I think...
I'll enjoy mortality.
