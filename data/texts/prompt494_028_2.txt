"I always knew I’d die listening to that song. I don’t know if anyone has felt this before but…when I heard that song I just knew. Something like goosebumps or maybe chills that hit me in my soul. It was an overwhelming sensation. Like being washed over by a wave emptiness."

&#x200B;

"But do you remember “How” you died?"

&#x200B;

Marcus startled out of his daze and peered across the elongated ebony ottoman to the figure before him. 

&#x200B;

She sat in a comfy high backed chair. Her bony legs crossed, covered in khaki, and her skeletal frame nestled in a maroon cardigan. Her pale skin was darkened with shades of alabaster, her hair the shade of deepest midnight, and her eyes were an empty all knowing void.

&#x200B;

Marcus couldn’t help but  be sucked in.

&#x200B;

She cleared her throat.

&#x200B;

"Marcus, do you remember how you died? I know this is a confusing time for you. It is part of the process."

&#x200B;

"Right."

He paused for moment. "Not really. I only remember the song."

&#x200B;

"Well, I won’t go into detail but you took your own life. It’s pretty clear where we go from here. I will escort you to the beyond and you will be processed. I like to speak with clients in order to facilitate the transition. Death is like a soft breeze. It is not a cruel process."

&#x200B;

With that she stood, towering over Marcus, and extended her hand. 

&#x200B;

Marcus couldn’t help but notice that in the other a scythe as tall as she had appeared.

&#x200B;

"So, so then what’s that for?"

&#x200B;

She let out a soft chuckle. The sound reminded Marcus of rain on asphalt.

&#x200B;

"To sever your earthly ties."

 

Marcus took her hand, stood, and looked back. Several ethereal strands floated behind him. As he followed the strands he saw that they connected everyone and everything he’d cared about. With one swift motion She cut them loose. Marcus felt weightless. Like he’d drift away, lost to infinity if he hadn’t had her as his anchor.

&#x200B;

“Shall we?” She asked gesturing towards the door.

&#x200B;

Marcus nodded caught in the gravity of her unblinking gaze.
