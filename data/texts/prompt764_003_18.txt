Mr and Mrs Sturgess, this is Principal Fenner. I am calling in regard to your sons recent.....behavior at school.  Although Kyle has recently shown a great increase in test scores, his actions have become  uncanny to a point where I feel I must speak with you in person. There is no possibility that he is cheating on the tests as we have already made sure of that. You must understand, it's the way the whole school has changed. Most of the student body bows when he passes in the halls and some of the teachers have begun to address him as "Sir". More worryingly several bullies have been absent from school for over a week and are officially reported missing. This are the most shocking but by no means the limit of strange changes. Please call me back immediately so we can schedule a meeting at your earliest possible convenience."

Susan felt a shiver run down her spine near the end of the message. She *knew* that it was irresponsible to let Kyle have that book but she thought he would just grow bored and toss it aside. After all, he was so disappointed when the book he wanted didn't arrive that letting him have what did show up was all she and Bob could do. 

Within a week the changes had started. They were small but good changes at first. He seemed more focused and interested in learning. Suddenly he stopped watching cartoons and eating candy. It was odd but probably just a phase, they thought.

Increasingly though, Kyle had become less and less like an 8 year old and more and more like an emotionless emperor, rarely talking and when he did it was mostly about trades and pacts and accords and deals! Their punishments had become increasingly ineffective and Bob was all for calling a psychologist. Susan had resisted, but if Bob heard this message there'd be no stopping him. Susan didn't know what to do. Without help, there'd be no stopping Kyle.
