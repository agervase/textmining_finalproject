“So, that film you were talking about?” She asked with a slightly irritated tone. Stopping mid speech wasn’t very polite. Especially when you’ve been hanging out with this person for half your life. Especially when this girl has been with you with your lows. And in any normal situation I wouldn’t have done this, but this was nowhere near normal. 

Not when time has stopped.

ERROR. PLEASE RE-CALIBRATE HEADSET. BE AWARE THAT YOUR CURRENT PROGRESS MIGHT NOT BE SAVED. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. 

Like a digital call from heaven, a semi-transparent, rectangle appeared with a sound appearing. A few seconds went by for me to take in this message, as the shade of blue wasn’t anything I’ve seen before. It was a colour, I think it was. Whatever it was, it was the strangest thing I’ve seen, so much that it was inhumane in a way that it should be impossible to see this. But here I am, experiencing the impossible. It was mind boggling with an alien sound so bizarre that it must’ve come from another dimension. It was immersive, it was as if everything was making this strange sound, even if it only appeared for, perhaps, half a second. Impossible, everything about this time stopping sign was impossible.

I reached in and grab the message, only to find that I was also frozen in time. Suddenly panic filled me, I realised that nothing was moving. That I wasn’t in there anymore. I couldn’t feel anything, it was such a strange feeling, something that should be there but isn’t. Yet, I was moving, I was moving outside of reality, I was about to cry if not for my non-existent hands touching my head. I didn’t feel my head, I felt some bulky helmet I tried getting it off me. I tried again, I tried pulling it. The moment I got it half a centimeter a feeling of pain struck every point on my body, every area from the backs of my eyes to the inside of my heart and everywhere in between screamed and wrenched in pain. I started to shout and scream and flung my arms around, before the pain went away and a soothing voice filled and immersed me.

“PLEASE DON’T PANIC. THE RESTORATION OF YOUR MEMORY WILL OCCUR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT REMOVE YOUR VISOR, THE CONNECTIONS WILL DAMAGE YOUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IF YOU REATTEMPT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.” 

It was strange, so strange, so strange that I wanted to cry. But I couldn’t, it was soothing. I want to listen to it again. 

“What’s happening?” Everything felt foreign and stiff. My voice was strange and different, it felt like my arms were a meter longer than it should be. Everything felt so tight and heavy. 

“Help, please help. What’s happening?” I tried saying, my voice now sounded sloppy and baby like. 

Then suddenly, my vision went white with the brightness of the reality outside reality. To prevent my inevitable blindness, I closed my eyes. Then I realised, “Memory restoration?” 

“YES. TO PROVIDE THE BEST ROLEPLAYING EXPERIENCE WE HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE USE OF OUR NEWEST PROGRAMS. PLEASE BE PATIENT. THE PROCESS WILL COMPLETE SOON.”

There it was again, the voice of god. 

I can’t think, I don’t want to open my eyes. I can’t-

As if it was never there, the visor came off my head in a more comfortable fashion than my attempt. I felt millions of little snakes crawl down my insides before feeling my hair fall back into place. 

Ah, I remember now. I remember this place. I can’t believe it really worked. It felt like over a decade of time fitted into maybe a hour or two. I remember my place here.

I opened my eyes.
