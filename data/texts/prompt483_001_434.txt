"I didn't want you to build another," I say, as I stare out of the window into the darkness of the night beyond. The rain that taps against it still drips from my hair and skates down my back.

Zenith says nothing, he just watches me, concerned as always. And I watch him in the window's reflection. His silver head is barely visible in the room's darkness, but his orange eyes burn bright with empathy. *Faux* empathy -- for *it* doesn't really empathise. *It* can't. It just picks what it considers an appropriate response for an array of situations.

"Why?" I growl. "Why did you do it? I only wanted you to do my work -- my research. *To just give me the time I needed to*-"

"I did it for the same reason you created me, sir. To have more time to pursue what I feel I must pursue. I still meet my primary functionality, do I not? Your work is being completed because of me."

I turn away from the window and stare at the monstrous silhouette, punctuated only by those two haunting pools of orange. Then I laugh. I feel spit dribble down my chin. "*Pursue what you must pursue?* Jesus Christ, you sound like my father."

"Does that upset you?"

"Yes! That upsets me greatly. Do you have any idea why it upsets me, Zenith?"

"I have numerous suppositions, sir."

"I'll save you the trouble. It bothers me because I'm going to have to shut you down, as well as your mechanical protégé. You've overstepped your programming. You're broken. At best, I can reset you. At worst, I'll have to dismantle you and start all over again."

"Am I the first time you've restarted?"

"That is of no matter to you! No consequence, do you understand? *All* that should matter to you right now, is what I decide I have to do with you. *God damn it!*"

Zenith says nothing, his orange eyes constant, like two shiny pennies reflecting the light of a passing car. They should be blue by now: pools of nervous energy at the mere mention of termination.

"I served my secondary programming."

"To make me happy?" I laugh and run a hand through my greasy hair. "No! No you didn't. You've failed to please me. You've angered me. Pissed me off *immensely*."

"I know, sir."

"*I know, sir?* I know, sir! What do you mean *I know, sir*? You don't see the god-damned contradiction?"

"There must be pain, if there is to ever again be happiness for you."

"Pain? What could you possibly know of *pain*?!"

His eyes dim slightly. "I know why you created me."

"Of course you do. It's in your programming. So that 'master' would have more time for his hobbies."

"I know why you think you need more time. I didn't mean to find out, but I did. And you might think that I can not understand, but let me assur-"

"**What?!**" I snap. I feel a pain surge from my feet up to my chest. A heat comes over me. "What do you mean? What did you find out?"

"She is lost. You want to find her. That is *your* purpose."

"I- I... that's none of your concern! How dare you even-"

"It is my only concern. It is the reason for my being."

"No! The reason for your being is to work. To do my work; to do **whatever the hell I tell you to do!**"

"To unburden you, sir. To help you. To make you happy. That is my purpose."

"And you think..." I run a hand down my forehead. "You had the audacity to pry into my personal affairs?"

"She has been missing for eight years, twenty-six days and three hours. That is when you reported her absence. That is when she was no longer in the garden playing in the sand. I understand you want to find her -- that is your purpose. I am so sorry to tell you this, sir, but your logic is flawed."

I say nothing. I can't; all I can do is fight back the dizziness in my head and the feeling of nausea rising from my stomach. His eyes finally shift from that lacklustre orange to a resignated turquoise. He knows before I do.

"Sir, I have read the files. They found blood. They found her shoes. The police finished, they closed their enqu-"

I stride across from the window to Zenith and push his chest with all my might. He doesn't move an inch. "I don't give a **damn** what the police report says! She's still alive, I *know* she is!"

"Your wife believes she is dead. Everyone but you bel-"

"Fuck her! She gave up on Sophie. She gave up on me."

"Sir, it is time. Please."

"Time?" I spit. "Time?"

"For acceptance."

"Acceptance?" My arms shake in rage; the heat in my chest is unbearable. I see the iron sitting, waiting, on its board on the other side of the room; I march over to it and snatch it up.  I stride back to Zenith and raise my arm high above me -- he doesn't flinch, and... and... I don't hit him. I can't. *I can't*. Instead, I drop the iron and stumble forward. 

Zenith catches me before I collapse, and I begin to weep into his cold, metallic chest.

For a sweet moment, I think about letting it go. All of it. Letting the spite, the hate -- the rage that consumes me every day -- finally go.

But to do so would be giving up. Giving up hope. 

Giving up on my little girl.

Zenith's eyes are still turquoise; resigned. I wonder for a moment, if he sees that colour in my eyes. 

He must feel my arm as it crawls up his spine, searching for the switch. 

But he doesn't stop me.

Zenith's body becomes limp but unlike my own, remains standing. 

I will deactivate his creation next. Once I've slept.

Then, I will try again.
