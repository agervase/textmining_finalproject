Word spread of the king's reward. Mere days after his announcement, word reached the sharp peaks of the nearby mountain.

On the third night, the king paced the halls, unable to sleep. Before long, he found himself in the courtyard. He walked among the flowers his daughter had so cherished. He bound the cloak tightly around himself and stared at the lonely a midnight flowers, themselves waiting for the sun to return.

A gentle gust rustled the bulbs. Moments later, a larger gust flattened them against the ground. The king looked up, expecting to see storm clouds flowing over the horizon. Instead an enormous winged creature was descending on him, eclipsing the moon.

The king stepped back in fear. The dragon had come for him too! With a final gust with the strength of a cyclone, the beast gently landed on the paving stones. Mud squeezed up from between the stones under its weight.

The king was unable to move, unable to shout, utterly defenseless, awaiting the flames. He closed his eyes so he would not have to witness his death.

"Father!"

The icy hold on his body was melted, though not by flame. He opened his eyes to see his daughter carefully scaling the dragon's neck as its head lowered to the ground. Her feet touched earth and she sprinted into the king's arms.

His face alit. His cloak unfurled and fell to the ground. He kissed his daughter's head until he could taste the soot in her hair.

They held each other there for a timeless moment, finally reunited after all hope seemed lost, until... 

"Ahem."

The king looked up into the face of this frightening creature. For the first time he noticed what looked like a sooty bedsheet pasted across the place below its nose. He had  never seen a live dragon before, but he was almost certain they did not have mustaches.

A deep voice poured from its mouth, like a soft bellow, "I believe there was a reward?"
