Reposting from an old AskReddit thread:

**VIGGO:** "O callous fool! O wretched son of mine!

'Tis not your deeds that thus provoke mine wrath;

Your thoughtless choice of victim, 'tis the root

Of all mine fury."

**IOSEF:** "Surely thou meanst not

That simple oaf whose car I stole tonight?"

**VIGGO:** "That "simple oaf" must surely be John Wick!

In days gone by, he was our fearsome champion;

His reputation known across the land.

Some knew the man as only 'Baba Yaga'."

**IOSEF:** "You mean to say he is 'The Boogeyman?'"

**VIGGO:** "The Boogeyman, that warrior is not;

For surely John is made of sterner stuff,

As ought to bring that monster to its knees."

**IOSEF:** "Pray tell! Sure I knew not; but true enough."

**VIGGO:** "John knoweth what he seeketh out to gain,

Committing all his will unto his task;

A trait, I fear, you have in short supply.

But harken well! For John once slew three men

With naught for weapons, save a simple pencil!

Yea, hearest thou correctly; one damn pencil!

But then, one fateful night, the fearsome John

Requests mine blessing, that he leave mine service.

As loath was I to lose my strongest weapon,

that night I gave to John a task so fearsome,

I could not think that any man could do it

And come away unharmed at journey's end.

Alas, this was a grave miscalculation, 

For all the bodies John had left behind

Became the strong and sturdy stone foundation

'pon which we rest, and gave me peace of mind.

But now, my dearest son, your grave mistake,

Of striking while the iron of grief was hot!

With John's dear wife still warm within the grave,

You steal away his car, invade his home,

Assault the man, and kill his treasured dog!"

**IOSEF:** "Pray calm yourself, for I can make this right!"

**VIGGO:** "Could that be so! And what, then, will you do?"

**IOSEF:** "Return tonight, and finish what I started."

**VIGGO:** "O simpleminded blackguard! Heard thee not

A single word that since hath left mine lips?"

**IOSEF:** "But Father, surely 'tis a simple task

To fix what I have wrought! Yea, I beseech you-!"

**VIGGO:** "Now, Iosef! Iosef! Listen! John will come;

And not a thing in Heaven or on Earth

Will thee attempt to do, for none will stop him.

Now go, my son! Be banished from mine sight!"
