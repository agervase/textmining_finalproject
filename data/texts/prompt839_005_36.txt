"Rook to..." I couldn't remember what square it was. I'd never really played chess before. Maybe once or twice, but I had never really had any interest in the game. It just figures I'd have to play one of the few games I never cared for in an attempt to resurrect my soul.

THAT'S E4. 

I couldn't entirely tell, but I got the distinct impression that Death was a little fed up with me, "Th-Thank you."

DON'T MENTION I--

The hooded figure gave such a start, slamming his bone-hands down onto the table where we were playing, that I thought I might have another heart-attack.
HOW IN THE HELL--WHAT'S ALL THIS--WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?!

"I'm--"

I was suddenly smacked in the face by a large roll of parchment. Death moved his fingers along the list, checking names and muttering things like, DEAD... DEAD... NOT LONG NOW... OH THAT WILL GET SOME LAUGHS WHEN HE SHOWS UP...
IS YOUR NAME TEIMOUR?

"No, I'm--"

WESLEY?

"What? No! I'm--"

VLADIMIR?

"NO! I'm a woman!"

SUSAN...? IS THAT YOU? Death leaned in a bit closer. If he had been wearing spectacles he would have lowered them momentarily, in an attempt to get a better look.

"What? NO! My name is Leanne! What is the matter with you?"

I'M SORRY LEA--WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

"Leanne!"

RIGHT RIGHT, OF COURSE... WELL, LEANNE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT IT SEEMS YOU'VE WON THE GAME.

"What game?"

Death looked at me blankly...which may not have been entirely accurate, but it felt like a blank stare, with a possible undertone of distain.

THE CHESS GAME, LEANNE. YOU'VE WON.

"I'm sorry, I don't quite follow..."

OH FOR THE LOVE OF--YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

Death rose out of his seat very swiftly, picked up his scythe, and chucked it at me. HEre! "Good luck," he said, "I doubt you'll have to deal with it for long."

And with that he began to walk away.

I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. I called after him.
