There are many times that one might regret lashing out in anger. Small phrases or jabs that may have gone unnoticed or at the very least uncontested could destroy old friendships, or completely ruin a family dinner while lashing out in anger.

&#x200B;

Jimmy had time to regret as he held a severed arm of his old teddy bear, the one that he had for as long as he could remember. He would have cried right there in his room, holding the worn tube of fabric in one hand and a phone craddling a rather long, awkward and depressing  conversation with his girlfriend, which the outcome of which could be summed up by the fact he no longer had one.

&#x200B;

"Sonnofafuckingbitch!"

&#x200B;

The crumpled pile of teddy bear and stuffing shuddered horribly. Small pools of dark black fluid splattered the wall the teddy bear had collided with. With far too much hideous squelching the head of the bear emerged from the pile, and fixed its pearly white button eyes on Jimmy's face. The scream that was desperately trying to muster in Jimmy's chest died with a flick of his old beloved Teddy's remaining arm.

&#x200B;

"Alright, we are going to be good and calm here alright? You tore off my arm, I've killed others for far more forgivable sins," the bear squeeked in a voice that was both reedy yet booming, "taking out all that anger on your poor old Teddy?"

&#x200B;

As the Teddy bear spoke it began to stretch and unspool itself before increasing in sizes, messy snapping and tearing sounds resonated from the battered frame of his Teddy bear until it stood a head higher than Jimmy.

&#x200B;

It stood before him, resembling worn fabric draped over the frame of an emaciated maniquin with button eyes the size of saucers. Two crude, semi circle pieces of fabic comprised the ears. The stump were its arm should have been oozed black fluid, which reeked of fish enough to make Jimmy gag. 

&#x200B;

"But hey, I'm willing to let bygones be begones, if you give me that arm back," 

the bear squealed, the light from its button eyes illuminating Jimmy's silent, terrified face.

&#x200B;

Jimmy's shaking hands tried to place the tiny plush arm into the stump of the now tall, thin bear, its faded cloth rendered filthy and crusty by the abominations transformation.

&#x200B;

"I don't think you're trying help," the bear said in a voice like a steaming kettle, "just put it back in!"

&#x200B;

Jimmy began to sob, his hands covered in the reeking black fluid, trying to force the tiny arm to adhere to the enlarged bear.

&#x200B;

"L-l-look I'm s-s-sorry..." Jimmy wimpered as he found the regained ability to speak did nothing to alleviate the terror he felt.

&#x200B;

The thing stopped and for a while let Jimmy sob. 

&#x200B;

"Aww, fuck. You know what? Fuck it. We can work something out. I'll let you in on a secret," the emaciated man sized Teddy bear squeaked as it turned to rummage around in Jimmy's near by drawer, before withdrawing a crumpled pack of cigarettes. It placed a single cigarette in the flat stiched mouth.

"I've been watching you for some time. If this deal goes swell then we could do another one!" The flat stich line mouth drew up in to a razor thin grin.

&#x200B;

The end of the cigarette burst into flames, as the bear gave Jimmy an obliging nod, "I'll let you sleep on it, only fair."
