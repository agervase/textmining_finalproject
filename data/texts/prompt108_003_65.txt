We didn't get much food again, mom and dad tried to put a positive spin on it, saying that God will provide once we wipe the evil spawn from the earth and show the government that they need to keep their hands off our land!

All I know is that I'm fucking starving and want to shower so badly, but these fucking redneck "freedom fighters" don't even know what living off grid means, they think it means splashing in a crick and hunting for your food.

I totally agree with my parents that the government is trying to claim too much autonomy on our land, and really if I think back on it part of the reason why we're here IS because I kind of had been pushing them for us to come check this place out and what they were fighting against...

But no one has any idea what they want to do.

Just yesterday I was talking to Bobby [Redacted]. Asked him what the next step was and he kind of froze and looked around before saying..."I dunno man, it's whatever we want! We need to show that gubberment what's-what and give 'em a  what-for!"

"Yeah, cool Bobby. But WHAT exactly is the next step?"

Bobby hesitated just long enough to Sally [Redacted] to amble up, sporting her coveralls. She's kinda cute but honestly she seems a bit too regimented...like....her ponytails are a little TOO perfect, you know?

"You fellas talkin' about giving the guvs a what-for and a what's-what? Oh man, I can't wait until we show 'em what we're made of!"

B: Yeah! We need to show 'em what we're made of...but I think we should do whatever your suggestion is, Sally? What do YOU want to do to the government?
S: Oh whoo, I want to do so much to the government...just....so much. But I'd rather hear what YOUR idea is, Bobby?

Seriously diary, it's like everyone is waiting for someone else to make a suggestion. Like it's some sort of game of chicken or something? We're holed up in this compound and I've been noticing that every single time I start poking around the guns I have at LEAST three people suddenly perking up and trying to talk to me about what I hate about the government, and then they keep trying to ask me what we should do about the government, totally my idea...they REALLY like stressing to me how it would ALL be my idea.

Like, I just want to stick-it-to-the-man by creating totally off-grid living and never having to pay a cent to them that way. Pay my property taxes by OVER-producing electricity and selling it back to the grid. That's why I came out here and my parents thought it sounded like a great summer camping trip for all of us to do and bond over as a family.

I'm a bit shy about pitching this idea to them, I mean from what I read in the 'paper when this group first started up last year they had a lot of BIIIIG ideas, I'm sure my ideas would seem small.

Man, I dunno. Maybe I'll suggest that going into town to buy a cheeseburger will be a great way to 'stick-it-to-the-man' to my parents.

Just noticed today that 9 out of 12 guys here have buzzcuts. Of the three that don't have buzz cuts it's me, my dad and some crazy guy that I'm pretty sure is just a homeless guy. Pretty sure that homeless guy has been here since way before this all started last year....at least he SMELLS like he's been here longer than this group has been.

**07-19-2012**

We were taking attendance today for the bi-weekly meeting, and when some guy was asked to spell a word he used that....phonetic alphabet? I just know Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo really, but it was pretty noticeable. Just seemed weird, ya know? They did that at our intake actually.

Okay....so my mom offered to host a cooking class for anyone that was interested and pretty much **everyone** showed up, and they were taking a lot of notes the whole time.

But the class was so quiet so my mom told them not to be shy, ask questions at ANY point in the class.

Like, great, these folks were interested in learning some of my mom's recipes and they gave mom some of the group money to go out and buy her supplies.

But they kept asking really weird questions throughout? Like...I wrote them down, hold on. Even mom was confused, but, okay here we go:

1. So when do you add the fertilizer?
2. Where are the pipes that you store it in when it's done 'cooking'?
3. Do you have a distributor you give this to? Do you launder the profits or keep it off shore from those sales?
4. How long before serving this to the president do you put in the poison?
5. You seen my foot washing pot?

That last one was the homeless guy. Turned me off from having Mom's famous chili for about an hour but then hunger just took over. None of the other group members wanted to partake, but they've been checking on me a LOT since I ate it. No idea WHAT'S going on.

**07-29-2012**

We had a family meeting yesterday, and today we've just been packing up in secret. We're going to leave, we think. My parents are just so disappointed with the lack of movement by this group (and mom's been pretty bummed out that none of them wanted to eat her chili. Seriously, that is kind of low of them. Like, snobs much?)

We're writing a letter tonight to leave behind when we sneak off. Basically we don't want it to sound like we stopped believing in the cause because of them, or that we only came here out of general curiosity.

So we're thinking of putting something like "learned so much, feel like we're ready to make a real, big, PERMANENT mark on the world!" and something about how we want to blow the lid off of all of it (or something like that) and that the government should pay for how it's been lying to us for so long!

And then something about God praise them all (mom's insisting on this part) and we know we all walk a divine path and that one day we will all bask in the light of god.

Or something, blahblahblah. Mom signed it with a bunch of "Kisses" but her X's always end up looking like lower case t's ...but ttt is better than XXX, that just makes me think about porn too much...
