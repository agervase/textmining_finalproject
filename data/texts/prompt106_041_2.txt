She watched as the man crawled out from his burning house, flames reflected in the Star of David around his neck. The man reached for her, but she only stared. As his chest stilled and eyes glazed over, she leaned forward, eager, anticipating. Her breath caught, and He appeared. She was transfixed, and to Him she did not exist. He drew the man to his feet, and the man embraced Him. She envied the man with a passion she had never felt before. Together, He and the man departed, walking away in each other's arms. Taking him away from herâ€‹. She frowned.


Years later, she pulled the lever. Machinery moved, escaping gas hissed, and she hurried to her seat by the window. Muted wails reached her ears, but she ignored them, ignored the gaunt men and women pressed together in the chamber, and checked her watch. She was eager. As the hissing stopped, she leaned forward, eager, anticipating. One moment there were only bodies in striped uniforms, then He stood among them, and one by one they received their last embraces. She laid a hand on the glass, wishing she could be with Him, knowing the lucky souls in that room appreciated all she had done for them. When He departed for the last time, she sighed and stood, wanting, needing to look upon Him again. 


Years later. She stood with a wall to her back, a row of men in front of her. She frowned with impatience, and her foot started tapping. One of the men started to speak, but she did not hear. She checked her watch. She was eager. The men raised their rifles, and she leaned forward, anticipating. The men fired on command.


She lay on her back, and He looked down at her. He extended His arms to her, and she stood, welcoming the embrace she so craved. It was cold. She was cold. She felt no pleasure wrapped in his arms, and knew something was wrong. She turned her head away from Him, and He turned with her. To face what was coming. Together. And together they departed, as lovers, as strangers, as long-forgotten friends.
