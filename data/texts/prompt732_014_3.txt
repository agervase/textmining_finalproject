I pulled the newbie's arm back. "Remember Trevor."


"Uh, sorry... what?"


"Huh, oh right I forgot this was your first day. Right, don't get all gung ho about fighting off these monsters."


"But that's our job."


"Well, about that, Royce, why did you bring a sword." 


Royce smiled at that and brought his sword from his scabbard, unleashing so many sparks I thought my coat would catch on fire. "We're the guardian knights squad. Isn't that what we do, run through the streets, jump across buildings, fight off orcs, slay dragons with swords."


My eyes bugged open and I released a small gasp from my mouth. It was like this newbie was trying to get us killed. 


"No, remember Trevor." I pressed a little harder.


"Uh, Trevor was a guardian knight he was so concerned with fighting the traditional way that he ended up dead. Yes, tough business, he had his non-regulation  sword in hand and ran after a shapeshifter ghoul. Geez what will they think of next?"


"But isn't that what we're supposed to do and all that, run into the darkness and kick whatever we find in the ass?"

Did rookies who were forced to join ever have so many questions, I thought.  Looking at Royce with a dry, blank stare, I turned my head just trying to figure out what sort of new recruit we had.  


"Anyway, things happened and good old Trevor tripped and literally fell on his sword. The little bugger he was chasing stopped and gave him a good little kick right on his head to do the trick. After that we thought never again. So we take whistles and report crime and if we must then we take our regulation guns. Sure, it takes a couple shots but we can always put them down. Or run. Running is best after all."
