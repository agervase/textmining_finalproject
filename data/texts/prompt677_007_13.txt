I sat still, brow furrowed, turning my head periodically to look between the conflicting information.

On my television - ancient but still functional, a beaten pair of bunny-ears atop it - Was a simple repeating message.

Over the radio, an entirely different one. 

Now I'm a simple, good-natured, law abiding citizen. When the television told me to protest, I went out and protested. When the radio told be to be outraged, I was outraged.

But what was I supposed to do when the two disagreed with one another?

Wait. My brain worked slowly, but I had the faintest inkling of an idea. Something tickling the corner of my brain. Quickly, I ran down to my garage, and looked thoughtfully over what I had there. Yes...yes, this could work. 

Grinning, I set to work.

Two hours later, I was done. It hadn't been easy to work up a hitch system for my ancient camper and my brand new Tesla, but necessity is the mother of invention. I grabbed the garage door opener and sat down inside my Tesla. 

"Tesla," I said, taking advantage of their new voice recognition software, "Take me to Yellowstone." That aught to be high enough ground, right? 

"Calculating..."

As soon as the car responded, I carefully slid to the side, letting the box of books I'd had beside me replace my weight. Wouldn't want those swanky weight monitors realizing I was gone, did we?

The moment I was free, I slipped out of the car, slammed the door shut, sprinted back into the empty camper, and even as I was closing the door, all blinds securely fastened, I pressed the garage door opener.

A moment later I felt the camper lurch forward, and then carefully pull out onto the road.

I turned on the TV and the Radio again. Stay indoors? Check. Don't look outside? Check. Evacuate immediately to high ground? Check.

I lay back onto my bed with a grin. 

And they called me an idiot.
