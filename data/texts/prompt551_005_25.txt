I opened my eyes and saw the cloaked figure standing before me. "Come with me" it said.

"You're.. you're the Grim Reaper, aren't you?" I said. I wasn't expecting to come home, but I also wasn't expecting to die so quickly. It happened in a flash.

"Not exactly, but there's no time to explain. You must come with me quickly!" He was looking around nervously, almost as if he was on the lookout for someone.

"Why the rush? We're already dead."

After confirming that whatever he was looking for was not near, he explained:"Not quite, you still have your soul. You can still talk to me. All the more reason to run." 

"Run from what?" I asked while he started looking around again.

He ran out of patience and grabbed my arm. I immediately freed myself from his grip. "I'll come. No need to drag me along."

"So, what are we running from?" I asked once again.

"The happy fat guy." the Reaper said in full seriousness.

"That doesn't sound all that dangerous. Why are we running from him?" I asked. He must be joking.

"He'll eat you." he answered without second thought.

"Eat me!?"

"Yes, he eats souls."

A lot of thoughts were going through me. First what it would be like to be eaten, especially how horrible that would be, since I was already dead. Then I thought about how I was dead and what even happened to me. All I could recall was that I was struggling with my weapon.

I thought about how I'd never see my family again and how horribly sad they must be after my death. I thought about my friends, my enemies, my parents.

And lastly I thought about how long we'd been running. We've been running for what felt like an hour, yet I don't feel tired at all. The moment that last thought crossed my mind I felt a sting in my side.

"Stop.. stop.. I need to rest." 

"You lasted longer than most people before thinking about your stamina. We can afford to rest a moment."

After slowing down to a more regular breathing speed I asked where he was taking me.

"To the reanimation wheel. I need to get your soul out of here. Back to your body."


"Back to my old body? But that's mortally wounded! I can't go back there!"


"You'll have to if you want to survive."

&nbsp; 

"So, this happy fat guy.. why does he eat souls?"


"Why else? He likes eating them." I must've looked really puzzled because he followed that up with: "Why do you think he's so fat? And why do you think he's so happy? You're his meal! He literally eats people like you for breakfast."

&nbsp; 

^^^^**Boom**

"Did you hear that?" A large figure appeared over the horizon.

"He's here!"

"Let's run!"

&nbsp;

^^^**Boom**

"Too late! It's better to try and fight him with full stamina. Trust me, I've been doing this for millenia."

"Fight him with what?" I asked him. All he had was a scythe. He couldn't be planning to.. 

&nbsp;

^^**Boom**

"I'll protect you with my trusty scythe!" he said full of confidence. "They don't call me the Grim Protector for nothing."

He was.. He planned to protect me with a scythe of all things. "You know a scythe isn't a weapon, right?"

"Of course it is! It has a blade with a sharp edge and a point at the end. What else could it be?"


^**Boom**

I couldn't believe my ears. This guy intended to protect me from that huge thing? "It's a tool! You can't fight with that! If you want to slice anything you need to get the blade behind them and you'll leave yourself wide open!"

This new knowledge has left him flustered. "I.. I can still stab with it!" 

"No you can't! The blade is curved! It'll bend when you try to stab someone."

"Well.. what do you know?? You don't look like someone with fighting experience."

"How do you think I died? I'm a farmer who brought a scythe to a battlefield!"

**Boom**

He was completely dumbstruck. "Look, calm down." I said "Have any other souls managed to get back to their bodies?"

"Just one." he said with a grim look on his face. "Not that I haven't tried."

"How did you protect the last one?" 

"I had some extra help with him." 

He shrugged.

#Boom
"No wonder they call you grim."
