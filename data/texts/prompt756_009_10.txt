"I imagine you didn't expect me to call so early", said David to the cloaked figure in front of him.

"***On the contrary.***" the figure responded, waving his hand towards the body in-between the two, lying in a hospital bed. "***This is usually as good a motivator as any.***"

"Heh, yeah... You, erm, you mind if we let them disconnect the... whatever that thing's called?"

"***The Dialysis Machine?***" 

"How do you know that?"

The figure shrugged. "***Given my work, I spend a lot of time in places like these. You can't help but overhear common parlance.***"

"Right... Still, the... the tone's sort of distracting. Among other things."

"***I can imagine. Shall we walk?***" He was already heading towards the door, as if anticipating the answer he would prefer, and giving the more living looking of the two no choice but to follow despite their misgivings.

"Er... You're kind of, you know. Very... thin, and-"

"***I have that issue accounted for.***" He stated simply, nodding very gently towards the doctors and patients surrounding them both, who seemed to not pay the skeletal figure a single mind. "***All a part of the job.***"

"Right, that's, erm... That's why I called, I guess." David cleared his throat, waiting for a gap in the crowd before daring to even whisper his next line. "Immortality kinda sucks. Watching your... You know, your..."

"***Mmm.***" The figure nodded in understanding, the kind of understanding birthed from battling a hundred-odd hardships of your own. "***You needn't explain yourself. What matters is that you are willing to hear me out.***"

"So... I'm guessing the job offer is replacing you? Letting you die and stuff?"

"***Not as such. A fair amount of what you think to know of us may have been a... Misinterpretation. Death - as a word - is the very top of the list of incorrect assumptions.***"

"Er... Meaning?"

"***Mortals - and of course, recently created immortals such as yourself -***"

"I wouldn't call 40 or so years recent." David interrupted.

"***It is in terms of immortals.***" the figure responded, plainly, almost wearily, as if it was far from the first time the explanation crossed his lips - or lack thereof. "***Either way. You're under the distinct impression Death is a proper noun, correct? A single individual.***"

"Yeah. You know, Death, the destroyer of worlds. As in, you."

"***Well, as I said previously, that is incorrect. Death is less a single individual, and more a job description. Or, to put it more plainly-***"

"There's more then one Death?" David suggested.

"***Indeed. As mortal creatures, human or otherwise, have increased in number, we have required more and more individuals to bring them to the afterlife. We have powers, of course, but we are not omnipresent.***"

"Why not?"

"***The ones more powerful then us have an arrangement that forbids it.***"

"So in other words, God'd get pissed if you stole his shtick."

"***That is another way of putting it, yes.***" The figure responded, with an attempt at a gentle chuckle, which created a sound like a chilling wind running through a tree's branches.

"So, er, before I sign up properly, is the whole skeleton thing a necessity?"

"***Technically, no. You'll find a great deal of Deaths tend to choose this form, however. Some for comfort in a physical sense, some for comfort in a mental sense.***"

"What's your excuse?"

"***To be frank, I grew tired of people questioning why I wasn't skeletal, so I decided it best simply to conform to stereotypes.***"

"Makes sense. So what's the job description? Is that another misconception, or is it pretty much as we think of it?" David questioned, as they continued their trek down the streets.

"***A mixture. What you know of us guiding souls to the afterlife is true, but it is only part of the job.***"

"What else could there be? Paperwork?"

"***Yes, actually. That, I must admit, is the part of the job that very few Deaths find to be to their liking. Myself included. Still, it is necessary to fill in after every collection, as well as there being extra paperwork for the ironic death department.***"

"Rewind, ironic death department?"

"***Please tell me you didn't truly believe that incidents of pure irony were not occasionally created by a higher power?***" The figure scoffed, as if such an idea was akin to believing the sky was green. "***It is a rare thing, but some Deaths find it to be an absolute joy. To be frank, you may not see a job such as that for many years. I suggest you put it out of your mind, lest you become jealous of those who claim the job before you can.***"

"Right... Anything else?"

"***There is more, yes.***" The figure stopped his movements, allowing David to notice they were now in an almost abandoned alleyway, bar one homeless individual, who seemed to be barely breathing as she slept. "***But we can discuss that once we return to our home base, so to speak.***"

"Are we going to do that now? In - In front of her?"

"***Yes. It shall be no matter, as she will be coming with us.***"

"... You mean...?"

"***I do. I imagine you think of it as unfair.***"

"Well not unfair, just... kind of sad, really. This is how she goes out?"

"***You'll learn to ignore those feelings in time.***"

"Somehow I doubt that."

"***The only other path is insanity, David. Take it from myself, and from others who have come to the same crossroads. Either you consume the feelings, or the feelings consume you.***"

"... I guess you might have a point." He responded, after a pregnant pause. "Right. Ready to go then."

"***Good.***"

And with that, the female - who had since slid to the ground in her rest, her breathing shifting the puddle of rainwater her face was now buried in - the male, and the skeleton were all enveloped by a somewhat disquieting black fog, which slowly enveloped them, dragging them away to the depths.
