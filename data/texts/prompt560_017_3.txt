The first thing I saw was the light. It was blinding, all consuming. White everywhere. At first I was confused, but then I remembered what I had been told. "Your eyes, they will be brand new, at first they can't even make sense of this new stimuli that the world will seem to be awash in." I tried to remember what else I'd been told and just calm down, but I felt so cold. It was the most uncomfortable cold I'd ever felt, and I had been to some cold places my... first time around. The expedition to Antarctica stuck out in my mind, it had cost so much, but was one of my favorite memories that I was looking forward to a second time around. But even that didn't compare to this cold, this cold felt like an absence, an absence of any comfort, and I couldn't do anything about it.

I was blinded by this light, my limbs felt awkward and useless, I couldn't even hold myself properly. I couldnt take it, and just when I thought I couldn't bear another second I was wrapped in something soft and warm that held me tight. I remembered a photo I had been shown of my mother holding me right after I was born. A flash of recognition and glee flitted across my mind. This was that moment, in my minds eye I could see exactly what this moment had looked like from my fathers camera. Of course my minds eye was far more reliable than my real eyes.

I still couldnt really see, and my ears weren't working, the room was just a dull hum, they had told me that none of my senses would work at first except... and there it was. Distinct smells. My mother, I think, and a smell I recognized, the almost sterile anti-septic smell of a hospital... well an American hospital anyways. I thought back to my trip to the Amazon, I had nearly died in that jungle and the hospital they had brought me back to was a far cry from what even the larger cities in Peru had to offer. This time around, I wasn't going to skip my shots when I took the trip into that jungle. But wait, what sense does it make to live the same life round again? I still have all the memories of all those trips before, why not go some place new?

I had been lost in thought and then a realization entered my consciousness, "are my eyes open or closed?" I realized I had actually been sleeping and had just awoken. I hadn't slept in the human sense in a long time, this feeling of a sensory jump was still alien to me. Then again, my very senses themselves were still alien to me, but I could still smell her and so I at least felt safe. I opened my eyes hoping to for the first time be able to see. The world was a blur, colorful blurs moving this way and that. I still couldn't make any sense of it, and worse my ears were still creating a din in the background. I could barely make out voices, but my brain simply couldn't recognize the words.

I tried to calm down and remember what else I was told. "We designed humans a long time ago, we didn't know what sorts of languages, patterns, sounds, and objects they would create, and your brain is rather busy during fetal development. There is only so much that we can pre-load to it before you are born. You will have to learn to use your eyes, ears, and other senses all over again. We couldnt know what languages you'd invent, or if you'd eventually move completely beyond even needing eyes at all, so once you're born you have to start putting these patterns together yourself until you can start recognizing things." 

&#x200B;

Now, what did they say would come next? "Faces, faces are the first pattern you'll recognize. Eventually you'll figure out an entire body, then  eventually you'll be able to distinguish different categories of people, first by gender, then age, and you'll be able to recognize individual people fairly quick. It'll be faster for you since you already know what you're looking for, but can you imagine doing this from scratch, with no concept of any of these categories, or entities and building an entire world within your head before you ever speak your first words?"

I was happy that at least it'd be easier this time around, but I still had so long to go until I would have the chance to change the one thing I came back here to change. I let my memory of the machine sustain me. I at least know which configuration was necessary to bring me to the new life+ program, but with a few tweaks I may yet find the code to change my birth parameters. Wouldn't that be something...
