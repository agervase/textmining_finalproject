***The Blood of Angry Men***

**Part 1**


All us helpless billions watch on our little glowing rectangles as the human race dies in droves. They fall screaming, choking, burning. The internet’s bad in the house, so me and my brother and sisters hunker on the steps of the chicken coop to see it.

Together we watch the end of the world. Our breath clouds and storms around us. But we do not notice the cold. Our hearts and bones are lead.

My siblings don’t make a sound. I look between the three of them and the black, faultless sky. I wonder if the afterlife looks like night, or if just looks like nothing. I wonder if I’ll find out soon.

Somewhere far away, death shrieks scarlet overhead. Ships with roving eyes swarm the sky like an army of locusts. Bodies, whole and unwhole, strewn out one atop the other, abandoned where they fell. Entire skyscrapers collapse like dominoes. News anchors weep, openly, if they’re on the air at all. My sister flicks restlessly through live streams, unable to pick which tragedy to behold.

We crowd my oldest sister’s phone, barely able to watch yet unable to look away.

She stops at the live press conference from the president. His voice is grave and hollow; he speaks to us from a dark room in some bunker somewhere. He says, “—at this point we have little hope. We will defend ourselves to the end, but tonight, please, stay inside, stay with your loved ones—”

My brother Aaron has his head between his knees. When we were kids he ran screaming after the cougar that took his puppy. (Aaron didn't catch it.) I never believed fear was an emotion he had. “Turn that shit off,” he gasps.

“Ignoring the aliens invading our fucking planet won’t make them go away,” Maya snaps but she switches to Facebook. Not that any of her friends would have time to post *oh shit I’m dying*, anyway.

Out here, under the unblinking stars, surrounded by a chorus of crickets and coyote, I can’t fathom what waits out there.

“Someone has to tell Papa,” Jackie murmurs. She is my twin, but you can’t tell. People always seem disappointed that there’s such a thing as non-identical twin sisters.

“You’ll just scare him.” Maya, the oldest, has always been the unofficial boss of all of us. She made it official when Dad started mistaking her for our mother and trying to scramble uncracked eggs. 

“He deserves to know,” she insists.

“If they come here,” Maya says through her teeth, “we’re not getting a panicked old man into the truck without hurting someone, alright?” Her words hang frozen for a moment.

“Do you think they’ll come out here?” I whisper. I am the youngest by eight minutes, and I am good at the part. 

“No,” says Jackie, quickly. “We’re in the middle of nowhere.”

Aaron pulls his beanie over his eyes. “I wouldn’t rule it out, Jack.”

Maya gasps into her fingers. “Oh, god, they’re in Spokane.”

Bile shoots up my throat. That’s barely a hundred miles from here. Not even a particularly large city. I wonder if they’re hunting us one by one. Like rabbits.

“Shit, is that Maddie’s—?” Aaron snatches the phone from her hands. 

I lean over his shoulder to see. 

My sister’s friend has pressed her phone lens to the window of her dorm room. In the background, she speaks in rapid, panicked whispers with her roommate.

Outside her window mortars plummet in blue and yellow streaks, big as bowling balls. I hear her cry, “Are they bombing us?” as the first one connects. It blooms soundlessly, a pale yellow locus, and then the power of it explodes outward. 

It takes Maddie maybe six seconds to die. She has enough time to say, “I need to call my mom,” as the wall of smoke and debris rushes toward her like a sulfurous tsunami. The window shatters. The video goes black.

I don’t even realize what I’ve seen until Maya starts bawling into her hands.

A strange fire tingles in my palms, my belly. I feel the urge to move. To rise and fight.

“We have to do *something*,” I say.

Aaron looks at me like I’m an idiot. “Like what?”

My fingers dance against the leg of my jeans. I know I should be scared as hell, but something in me is restless. Hungry for something very old, and long-forgotten.

I stand up and face my siblings. I look them over carefully, in case this is the last time I see them. “We will not just watch.” I point at the house. “We won’t just let them kill everything and everyone and just stand here and *watch*.”

Just south of us, down beyond the hide of the mountain, the sky turns red with fire.

Tears stream down my brother’s cheeks. “I can’t believe this is fucking it.”

I shake my head, insistently. Insanely. I don’t know why, but I can’t accept that this *is* it. That this is truly how we fall. 

I ball my fists up at my sides. A furious heat snaps at the bars of my ribs, yearning to set on those who dared attack our home, of all places. Our dad, of all people. 

I let the hate and heat fill me. 

Flame chases down my forearm, over my knuckles. The white hot of anger. My fist is a coal and my flesh is carved from the mountain, and I will destroy anything that threatens the ones I love.

“Avis,” my brother says, oddly calm, "why is your hand glowing?"

I look at my palm and grin. The fire finds my belly now. The chaos delights some new-awoken part of me that I had never known I possessed. It is like catching my reflection in an angle I have never seen before. I am myself, but different.

“I think...” I laugh, despite the clouds of smoke rising from town. It rises out of me like a bird. I have never felt smaller or stronger. “I think I did it on purpose.”

Maya drives me because she won't let me leave by myself. Aaron stays back with Dad, probably to watch DVR'd game shows with him and pretend everything is fine. Jackie lies in the backseat and lets out this low, constant groan of pure horror until Maya shrieks at her to shut up.

The truck flies down the mountain, towards the billowing columns of ash and fire. I stare at my palms, which well with blue fire like water. It licks down my hands and pools on the floor mats, where it vanishes like steam.

"Can you put that out or something? It's freaky."

"I don't know if I can get it back," I say, truthfully. "I don't even know why it's happening."

"Goddamn alien radiation," my sister mutters under her breath, like she has any real clue what's going on. "That's the only thing that makes sense."

Maya takes the corner by the Hendersons' farm too fast. The tires skid and shriek but just manage to cling onto the road. We keep going.

"I think we have to stop hoping for things to make sense," I murmur.

We are silent for the rest of the drive down the mountain. The burning thing in me paces like a fox. I want to feed it flesh and bone. If the aliens are even like us. If they're just a little fire of a soul trapped in a suit of meat.

But the more we drive the stronger I feel. The hotter the fire in me.

When we make it to the base of the mountain, a row of fire trucks from the reservation streaks past us on the freeway, sirens blaring. I want to tell them to turn around, that they should be getting people out who still have time to run, not throwing themselves into the chaos like a sacrifice. Like we're going to do.

Beyond the lake, the city is flames. The lakeside resort burns, a stalwart skeleton. Even the boats are burning. Rotten orange clouds choke the sky. Ships weave in and out of the gloom, dropping bright streaking bombs that fall glittering like jewels. 

For a moment we just sit, truck running, staring.

"They won't find us at home," Jackie says.

"There won't be a home anymore if they burn the damn forest down." I scowl out the windshield. "It's okay. I can walk from here."

Maya shakes her head. "It's five miles at least, Av."

"It's a good night for a walk."

My sister presses her forehead against the steering wheel and breathes hard through her nose. Then she turns on her turn signal--that's what kind of person my sister Maya is; she uses her turn signal even during intergalactic genocide--and heads after the firetrucks. Toward town.

"I love you," she says without looking at me. "But I'm gonna be real pissed if you get us killed."
