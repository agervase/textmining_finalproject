It was as if that within a snap of my fingers, the universe was black. No more beautifully placed stars in the sky, no more captivating space dust that would flow so beautifully through nothing. Yet, in the far distance, there was still one single, tiny dim light. 

"Odd" is what first popped in mind. Second was the irresistible urge to follow it, as that is ultimately my job, my life. So I did. I flew fast through the cold darkness of a place that was once filled with many different life forms, but what could possibly be left? It's the end. Nothing could have survived. 

Soon, there she was. So alluring, delicate and mesmerizing as she has always been. Her angelic eyes looking straight at me, and I feel a sudden warmth and light filling the void around me. It leaves me breathless, not that I need it anyway. 

I'm not a being with much emotion, obliterating the entirety of the universe had no effect on me, but the idea of having to dim the light of this beautiful entity was having me feel remorse, and dread. 

"I have to..." Is all I could whisper. "Everything must come to an end." 

"I know," She says, smiling genuinely, with the corners of her mouth quivering as if she is trying to come up with more words. 

We both take one last deep breathe. She closes her eyes, and meditates briefly, her face still with a soft smile. She gently starts falling towards me, and I embrace her into my arms and suddenly....

Nothing.
