Okay... this is bullshit, we have a "Sun" that will kill us if we don't drop dead first. The humans clearly forgot how to see the beings of magic, except for the cultist and religious, there not the dumb ones.

I work at an Airbnb on a remote island, I built a dungeon for my subjects that I harvest. "Somehow" on a rare ocassion a storm brews swatting their plane out the air, the females are always saved the young men are put to work until their ripe like the adult men that I consume when hungry. The women end up becoming my brood mothers, but until they mature they are servants brainwashed into my whim.

That lasted until i was locked up by a priest who took notice of my foul oder. I lay in chains made of holy material, the clerics were busy supressing my existence to the world, until the pope introduced me personally, the First Daemon, to be revealed to the world, and not an ounce of my being was bothered by holy anything... I apparently outed my kind and was deemed killable on site by them, so I was glad that I had the protection of the church, which is suprising as it is.

I was used... helping them with my magic reignited the entire school of magic for humans, all over the world people began to discover magic again. I was put even more into hatred by my kind. They actively attacked the Vatican looking to end me, bringing about the end of days, they failed as the armies of heaven descended upon them, opening up the rift between worlds... A rift to my world...

All it took was a prayer and my wings came back, flying so far and fast into the D-Void, I left that he'll behind, and returned to my life, D-118 my Dimension, A World full of ionically charged beings, with life spawning from it, the more ionically charged you were, the darker your skin tone was and the more sought after you were made. My skin was pitch black... I forgot why I left... shit.
