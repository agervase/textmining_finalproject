"Stop!" I screamed.

&#x200B;

"Don't!" I yelled.

&#x200B;

"Back!" I pleaded.

&#x200B;

It was useless.

&#x200B;

Fluffy tackled me in a hug and I simply fell over. Years of falling had allowed me to understand the art of how to fall. I landed with a soft thump, and was immediately beset by tongues.

&#x200B;

So many tongues.

&#x200B;

I battered at the heads, but the thick hide made it pointless as Fluffy gave me the hundred kisses.

&#x200B;

I laughed as I had to resort to my trump card. I reached up and began to dig into the area behind the central head's ears. 

&#x200B;

Fluffy immediately stopped, his entire body began to vibrate as it many brains tried to do different things. The central head wanted to wag its tail. The left and right head wanted to get in on the action.

&#x200B;

I grinned as I spread out my arms and proceed to try my hardest to kill Fluffy by boring into its brain. Which meant that I was simply scratching it.

&#x200B;

The central head looked left, then it looked right. Then it gave me the puppy eyes as it knew that I didn't have enough arms for it too.

&#x200B;

I snickered and stopped. 

&#x200B;

Two pairs of eyes joined the first. Their eyes glistened as they all whimpered at me.

&#x200B;

I laughed and gave each head a hug and a kiss. That mollified them all.

&#x200B;

I lead the oversized puppy to the back door. It lead to the forest as we lived on the edge of civilization.

&#x200B;

I opened up the back sliding door. Extra large for Fluffy, and let the beast prance around the snow covered back yard. I was never happier then now that I overspent on the dog training.

&#x200B;

Fluffy tended to let out things by the bucket. Pee or Poo.

&#x200B;

I shivered at the thought of another accident in the house.

&#x200B;

"Go find Jenny! Go give her kisses!" I half commanded, half encouraged and the freezer sized dog simply scampered away. it quickly disappeared into the trees that formed my back yard 'fence'.

&#x200B;

From the simple pamphlet I received, Fluffy was still a teenager. I feared how big she would get when she was mature. I think I need to get more dog food. Which was dumb as she ate half a bag a day already.

&#x200B;

I calmed my breathing and I was soon rewarded with the surprised cry of Fluffy giving my daughter the hundred kisses.

&#x200B;

Her faint cries to make Fluffy stopped were ignored and I smiled in self satisfaction.

&#x200B;

As a father, it was sometimes the smallest things that brought the most joy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I jumped as Antoinette made her presence known. 

&#x200B;

I looked down at my possessed daughter thingy. She stared back at me with her nearly soulless eyes and raised her arms.

&#x200B;

I sighed and picked her up. She could get cranky and you wouldn't like her when you were cranky.

&#x200B;

She hugged me and gave me a clumsy kiss. I kissed her back on the forehead. Her realistic skin was soft and warm to the touch.

&#x200B;

It was weird. I had Jenny, but Antoinette was like the child that remained unchanged. She was still one of Jenny's favorites, but as Jenny grew, she spent less and less time with Antoinette.

&#x200B;

Which meant that it was up to me to pick up the slack.

&#x200B;

Antoinnete then handed me a letter and then proceeded to snuggle into the hug. Her eyes closed, but I never could tell if she ever fell asleep.

&#x200B;

It was clearly marked with my name. The ink was reflective from black to a crimson red. The penmanship was ridiculously high quality. Like sexy good. 

&#x200B;

I opened up the letter, and the thing simply slid down into a smooth piece of parchment. Not a crease was present anymore.
