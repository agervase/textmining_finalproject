When the contestants came down the ramp in front of hundreds of TV cameras, with billions of eyes watching live from across the globe, it was clear they had no idea what was happening.

A few murmurs coursed through the gathered military men. "Those don't look like our alien friends here," one said, motioning to the two 7 foot tall red creatures nearby that looked like a pair of jittery shrews.

"No," replied another. "They're almost--"

"--Human!" said the other. "Look, those are two *women*!"

Emerging clearly from the haze of the vehicle's vapors, two women looking startled but startling edged carefully off the ramp. One was dressed in a shining golden gown, and the other in a liberal bikini.

Quick chattering overtook the gathering. One would've heard things like:

"I thought it'd be one of their own. But I guess they might have a chance."

"Can you believe all they want is entry to the Miss Universe pageant?"

"They got my vote!"

More observant minds wondered how these human women got on the ship in the first place. Were they also crew members of the alien host? Will the pageant accept their entry as "other"?

The women reached ear shot of the gathering, and when they realized where they were they burst into tears and came running into the arms of the nearest soldiers, crying:

"Â¡O que maravilla que nos han rescatado! Que horror, que horror que fue eso del espacio con esas cosas!"

"Quitanos de la vista de estos pela bolas, les rogamos!"

One of the soliders overheard and approached the general. He said, "Venezuelan, sir."

"What was that, sergeant Sanchez?"

"The ladies, sir. They're Venezuelan."

"Venezuelan?"

"Sir."

The general turned his glance up at the two aliens. Had they abducted two attractive Venezuelans to present as their own entry? The general's icy stare bore into them, and they felt it.

The shrew-like aliens shifted their weight, motioning toward the women as if to say, *their idea*.

The general sighed. 

"Alright!" he said. And then, after a long pause. "I'll allow it."
