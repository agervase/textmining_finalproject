**Part 1**

The morning was altogether uneventful. I tightened my tie as usual as I stepped out, on the cusp of tardiness. I took my thermos with me to the car, set it down in the cupholder, and backed out of my driveway. Once I got on the interstate, I was greeted by the usual traffic blocking every which way. I reached for my thermos and by some odd twist of fate, I spilled the blistering contents onto my jacket. I looked down, frustrated, before feeling my car smash into something large, heavy. The sound of grating metal filled my ears and I lurched forward before my airbag greeted my head. The horn blared, and I woozily stepped out of the car, struggling to keep my footing. Once I regained my senses, I went back into the car—the object I had crashed into was a massive extradimensional llama. I didn't realize its otherworldliness at the time, just its... llamaness. So like any rational human being, I assumed I had sustained a major injury and climbed back into the car to dial 911... and my phone was dead. I peeked my head back out the door, and the llama still stood there, the hood of my car concave about its body. It munched placidly on... something in its mouth. I look and it appeared to be a playing card? It was around this point when I looked around me—every other car was frozen in time. The woman to my right was putting on her lashes, the man behind drumming to some unknown beat. And there I stood, free from time's bounds, accompanied by a llama that was similarly unfettered.

I approached it cautiously, avoiding eye contact with it—something about it was unnerving. It continued to munch away at the card, oblivious to my approach. Once I came near it, it stopped chewing and slowly turned to me. It peered into my eyes, and I saw the universe. Those eyes were galaxies, infinite pools of wisdom and knowledge the human race may never be privy to, secrets no mortal should know.

*I find you to be suitable, human,* a voice said in my head. The llama did not break eye contact. *I am Cosmitron, traveler of dimensions, judge of universes. You will be my subject today.*

"I-Is this the llama speaking?" I asked. It nodded and without warning, threw up the card it was chewing and a succession of other cards, 51 to be exact. I knew this because it told me its exact intentions when it decided to empty the contents of its stomach. Those intentions were to test me. A simple game, it said. To decide whether or not the human race needed a bit of culling. I was its representative, the most average of all humans. The mean, the norm, the baseline for humanity. This was all conveyed in a single thought, a package of information transmitted instantly from the llama's brain to mine.

*Shall we begin?*

I blinked and found myself in a church, time frozen. The deck of 51 cards was in my hand, and the llama trotted to my side. It huffed.

*This is one of your centers of religion—I have gathered this from my observations. Are you religious, sir? I see you are not... a wise decision considering all you are experiencing currently.*

I felt warm vibrations fill my body, a sense of joyousness and warmth... I suppose that was its version of a laugh. A nun sat at the altar, knees bent, praying fervently. The llama turned to me, arching its head at the door. Time unfroze, and a surly looking man in a black coat stalked towards the altar, hand in his coat. He brushed past me as if I weren't standing there.

*You aren't standing there in the current world, human. We are on another plane of being, one I have graciously granted you access to. Your first trial begins now.*

The man reached the altar. The old woman turned, opening her arms to greet him with kindness; he responded with a blow to her face. I turned to the llama for his reaction, but he was gone.

"Help," she screamed. The man drew back his fist once more, battering her face. She fell to the ground, hitting her head on the stone steps to the altar. He reached into his coat—I didn't know what was in it.

"Stop!"

He turned, watching me through beady eyes, narrowed in some primal instinct. He was a predator.

"You have no business here. Leave while you still can." He drew his hand from the coat to reveal a pistol, aimed down the aisle at the center of my forehead. I put my hands up, deck of cards still sitting therein.

"I don't want any trouble, sir. Just don't hurt the lady," I said.

"Her," he said, motioning the gun at the nun, "her? She deserves it more than anyone!"

I approached slowly, keeping my hands up. I sensed that how I handled this would determine the llama's judgement.

"What has she done to you? She's an old woman!"

"That's none of your GOD DAMN BUSINESS!" he shouted and let loose a shot at the ceiling. The bullet bounced off of a granite sculpture, sending the fixture tumbling to the ground where it shattered, making me flinch and causing the woman to wail.

"I just want to help," I said, "I don't want anyone to get hurt."

I was nearer the altar. His gun was no longer pointed at me, but at the floor. He breathed heavily and brought the gun back to me. I stopped in place.

"She ruined my life. She... she guilted my wife out of an abortion. And the kid... he's real messed up man. Got some real fucked up shit goin' on in his head, and it's because of this bitch right here!" He pointed the gun at her head again, and she wailed. I watched his motions—they didn't seem decisive, he was making all of this up on the spot. This wasn't planned. He was lost.

"My brother had something like that, you know. Real big problems like you were talking about. I felt like I didn't have a brother for a long while—even when I went off to college he still couldn't talk to me. I was his big brother and it felt like I had a force of nature in the house, not a relative. But you know what? I worked through it. My parents and I, we got him therapy. We've been helping him. He's better now, he can talk and you know what? He loves to bake." I moved a bit closer to him. The gun steadily drooped away from the woman towards the ground.

"Whenever I go back home for Christmas we bake cookies together. I'm really bad at it, but he makes up for it. Because he doesn't care that I can't bake. He just wants to be with me, man. That's all he ever wanted. He just wanted to be close to his family, be loved by the only people he felt could love him. That's all your kid wants from you. This isn't what they want. You need a relationship with them, not to take out your anger. Work with them. Cross that bridge. Show them love."

His gun fell from his hand to the floor. He sat on the steps, head in hands, murmuring to himself.

"What have I done?"

The nun stood shakily, nodding to me before crouching down to comfort the man. Then, they froze, and faded away. I was alone in the church.

"Did I pass?"

*With flying colors. On to the second trial.*

**Part 2**

I suppose I wasn't the worst choice to represent humanity. What I had just done was... reasonably heroic? I don't think the average human would have been able to do that, though who knows. Might have just been the adrenaline.

It's a dark room this time and there are two people tied up, covered by masks over their heads. A table sits in front of me, a shotgun fully loaded, five shells.

*How can you sacrifice for the greater good, human? What will you give up? Can you bring yourself to protect that which is deserving of protection?*

The door behind me opens, letting light stream into the room. My father walks in, a massive butcher knife in hand. He crosses past me, not even bothering to look at me on his way to the people. He ignores the shotgun. He reaches the person to my left. He removes the mask—it's my brother. He stalks to the other person. I didn't need to look to know it would be my mother.

"This is the test? Is this some sort of sick way to force me to kill my family or I die at the hands of my dad?"

He puts his knife to my mother's neck and stares into my eyes—his are dead, pitch black.

"You're joking."

He didn't move even an inch. He just stared at me with those unfamiliar eyes. The shotgun lay on the table, rounds still chambered, waiting for my touch.

"I'm not shooting my dad. That's not happening."

The knife slid slightly, and a drop of blood dripped onto her blouse. She didn't react, her eyes stayed fixed on the wall behind me. 

*It will be her first, then your brother. You must decide.*

"Hell no, I'm not doing this." I turned to leave the room but the door my father had entered through was gone. I was trapped in this hellscape. 

*There's only one way out.*

The knife moved another millimeter. More blood. 

"Get away from her. You're not real, you're not him."

He didn't respond. His hand trembled as if excited to slide that knife all the way.

*Time waits only for me, human. And I grow impatient.*

His voice made me angry. It wasn't what he said, but his emotions made me impatient for something to happen, by my hand or my father's. The knife was nearer to the middle of her throat than the edge.

*Fine.*

In one fluid motion I grabbed the gun, pumped it, and shot at the phantom version of my father. The three dissipated into smoke, leaving me alone with a shotgun with four shells and the voice of an interdimensional llama in my head. I sat down on the floor, head in hands. I was ashamed.

"Is this good enough for you? Is this sufficient. This isn't a fucking game you psycho, this is my life you're screwing with! Real goddamn lives you're trying to ruin!"

Nothing happened. The table was gone, the light was gone, all I knew was the cold steel of the gun in my hands.

*You pass the second trial. We will proceed to the third.*

He went silent and I was left alone in a dark void, accompanied only by my thoughts, an incomplete deck of cards, and some buckshot.

******This was a lot of fun to write! If there's interest, I'll release a third part :)******
