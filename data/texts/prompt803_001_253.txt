**Listen up! I'm the head robber and I'm in charge here. Probably a mistake to use my voice because now you know what I sound like. (cockney accent) Or do you? (German accent) You vill never learn zee truth! (normal voice) And so on. You! You there, with the backpack and wearing a ski mask.**

Me?

**What's your name kid?**

I'd rather not say.

**Smart! I mean, maybe not so smart. It's 93 degrees outside and you're wearing a ski mask. You don't see that much, outside of stealing stuff. Look, I don't recommend my line of work but should you ever, you know, fall by the wayside, I'd like to recommend this disguise.**

What disguise?

**See? It's ingenious. (Claps hands together.) Now then, tellers, I want you--**

Excuse me, could I leave?

**What, now? Come on, kid. You leave after we leave plus that laying down and counting to one hundred business. Have you ever seen a bank robbery movie?**

Of course! Too many, perhaps.

**I like you kid. Sure, I'll let you leave. Just curious though, what's in the bag?**

The bag? (looks down) Uh... Urine sample. Doctors appointment. I may have a UTI and yeah, doc's like "you know the drill" but I don't because Im only fifteen and this has never happened to me. So can I go?

**Sure, kid. Now get out of here! That looks like a really big sample.**

I drink a lot of Big Gulps.

**Probably what gave you a UTI in the first place. (laughs) I kid. My first job was at a 711. That's where I got the idea to steal from people. It's so much more profitable.**

It sure is. Bye, Mister! (runs out)

**That kid sure seemed nice. (turns to camera to address the reader). You know that bank robberies are bad, but you know what's worse? A urinary tract infection. Folks, be careful out there. If you have pelvic pain, an increased urge to urinate, or see blood in your urine, call your doctor. Please. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a bank to rob (turns, walks back to teller window with a smile).**
