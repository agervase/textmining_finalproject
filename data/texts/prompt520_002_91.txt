This had to be the most realistic dream I have ever had. The last thing I remember is laying down, thinking about Josh when suddenly I **am** Josh. Everything feels so real, the smells, the sights, the *clothes* even. Hell, I didn't even know that my brain knew so much detail about Los Angeles but this dream was as vivid as they come. It was 11p.m. in London when I laid down and my brain even nailed the fact that it was around 3p.m in LA. 

That's when it hit me. This wasn't a dream. It was all too real to be a dream and the fact that everyone on the sidewalk looked as confused as I must be proves the fact that I'm not the only one experiencing this. Does that mean Josh is in my body? Feeling around in his - my jacket pocket I fish out a cellphone. "Shit!" I hear myself say in that familiar voice. "What could he have his pin be?" I try his birthday, his sister's birthday, the day he graduated. None of them worked. Frustrated I decided to walk to the nearest Starbucks to get some wifi and some much needed caffeine. Damn Josh and being healthy all the time. 

Unluckily for me I had no knowledge of the city of Los Angeles. Nor would anyone in the Starbucks have any knowledge of making coffee. And asking random strangers to use their phones was a bust because as in my case no one knows the passcodes, or even speaks English. Deciding to try again I put in my own birthday and to my surprise the phone unlocks. "Why my birthday though?" I wonder aloud as I search for my name in Josh's contacts. Why does everyone half to have a nickname in this damn list?! 

After trying a few that might be me my thumb - Josh's thumb, stops over a contact that just has a heart emoji as a name. Wouldn't hurt to try. After a few rings the person on the other end picks up. "Who is this?" I hear my own voice demand over the phone. Weird, definitely weird. "It's me, well, you. I'm in your body Josh."  "Who is Josh?" my voice, laced with suspicion, inquires. 


**PART 2**

If Josh isn't in my body then who the hell is? "Um..." I stall, trying to figure out which direction to take the conversation. They already seem irritable but I need as much information out of them as I can get. "If you aren't Josh, do you mind telling me your name? That is, your name before you hopped into my body." A long pause. As soon as I start to speak again they quickly cut me off. "So-" "It's Ezekiel." Well that's a start, but they said it like I would know who they are. This just keeps getting weirder and weirder. And so does the scenery around me. Grown men crying for their 'Mama', young children taking charge or driving vehicles, a little girl testing her arms and legs out to see if they work. "Ezekiel huh? How are things on your end? Here it's utter chaos." Another long pause. "It's calm for the most part. The majority of people here were asleep and it seems the people transferred into them fell unconscious or at the very least didn't wake the bodies they now inhabit. Now if you don't mind me asking how did you know to call this number and who is Josh?" They sound suspicious again. Makes me wonder if they think Josh or I had anything to do with this. "Well as I said earlier I'm in Josh's body, and you are in my original. Josh is a friend of mine from university. He moved to LA after graduation to pursue a carrier opportunity. I think that about covers your questions. Now for some of my own. Why did you say your name like I should know you? Do you know anything about what's currently going on? And have you tried getting into contact with your old body?" Silence.

*click*

The bastard hung up on me! Looking around some more I notice people are starting to calm down as they figure out the situation we are all in and grouping up to either explore or pool their knowledge together. Figuring I have nothing better to do I fiddle around with Josh's phone until I find his navigation app. Tapping on the button labeled 'Home' I set out. As I arrive at the address an old woman sitting on a nearby bench glances at me and I notice the glint of recognition in her eyes. Must be someone who knows Josh! I wave at her and she pats the seat next to her. Walking briskly to join the mysterious woman I call out "Do you know this body?" She nods but doesn't speak until I am standing in front of her. "Of course I know you silly. Remember I'm Dorothy, your neighbor. Jeez, I'm the one who should be forgetting stuff like that. You're too young!" Confusion painted my face. Did this person not switch bodies? "Dorothy, are you still in your own body?" Now the confusion was plain on her own face. "Why of course I am, I mean, who else's body would I be in?" Could this day get any more strange? "Well..." I start, unsure if I should tell her the truth. Then it clicks. I need to find information on Ezekiel and it's worth a shot. "Do you happen to know anybody named Ezekiel?" "Afraid not, another person who you have business with?" she asks sweetly. Business with? What has Josh been up to? 

"No no, just someone a friend mentioned to me. I'm gonna go inside now Dorothy, nice to mee-talk to you." She almost looks sad to see me go. Fumbling around for the key to Josh's apartment I find a crumpled note in his pocket. For now I ignore it as I set my sights on the inside of his room. "You can tell a bachelor lives here," I joke to myself noticing socks and a pair of shorts on the couch and various snacks littering the table. In between the mess I notice Josh's laptop. I flip it open to be greeted by a familiar picture. Graduation day when Josh and I went to the bar. We both look so happy in this photo. Too bad he had to move to the States. A quick search on the name Ezekiel comes up with almost nothing. Just who is he and why does it feel like I should know him? *ring ring* Speak of the devil, looks like I'm-Ezekiel is calling. I waste no time in picking up the phone. "Ready to answer some questions?" Josh's voice booms into the phone. "Not the ones you want me to, but I think I found your Josh. Some other number called this phone looking for you. Obviously he was confused when your voice answered the phone only to tell him I'm not actually you. Anyways he wants to talk to you as soon as possible so I'll text the number to you." *click* I'm not sure whether to be irritated or happy at Ezekiel right now. I still know nothing about my body's inhabitant but on the other hand I might be able to talk to Josh soon. 

As I wait for the text I open and flatten out the crumpled note that was in Josh's pocket. It feels like I'm invading his privacy right now but curiosity got the better of me. *'Meet the new contact tomorrow night at the usual spot. 9 p.m sharp. Goes by the code name Ezekiel'* This doesn't make any sense. Was Josh supposed to be meeting this Ezekiel person? And for what kind of business? This all seems extremely shady.
