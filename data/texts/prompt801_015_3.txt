As a kettle starts to boil the whistling sounds of its top can be heard throughout Maurice's small house

&#x200B;

. A morning ritual of his for the last 25 years and one he wasn't about to stop now.

&#x200B;

“I'm coming .... I'm coming.... you noisy pain in the ass.” He calls out to the offending kettle. 

Laughing he knows that it's the same line he has used more often than not since he received it as a wedding gift.

&#x200B;

“Maurice , language.” Jo-Anne's warm voice calls from the other side of the house

&#x200B;

.“I know I know.” He says softly to nobody in particular as he turns the burner off and moves the kettle over.  With long familiar movements he turns the  counter top radio on and starts to prepare a well used tea ball.

As Maurice reaches for another cup he stops himself short of the cupboard handle. Momentarily misty eyed he focuses back on the single cup in front of himself and slowly moves the single cup and himself to a worn and comfortable chair in front on a picture window.

“Maurice don't bother making me a cup, I can't say I've had the appetite for it recently.” Jo-Anne's voice fills the kitchen as she moves into the now empty space. She eyes everything on the counter, making sure nothing is out of place. “You know Maurice it's getting a little dusty in here. I don't think you clean often enough. What will the kids think the next time they come over?”

&#x200B;

Maurice smiles behind the tea cup. He had heard that often enough but still wouldn't dignify it with a response. Nothing was rotting and frankly the kids gave him more than enough notice to make sure the house was neat. Not Jo-Anne neat but close enough for his taste

&#x200B;

.His eyes turned to the sidewalk and he watched the familiar figures go by.  Brian and Doug ran by each morning at the same time with Maya, their black lab, at the same time Maurice had his tea every morning. A friendly wave and between neighbours was the most interaction they had but it suited Maurice just fine after all the years. Behind them ran a dozen other neighbourhood pets that enjoyed the same routine day after day. Maurice figured that Maya would soon join the pack a few years as her pace had slowed over the last few years and her muzzle was looking more white than black.

&#x200B;

“I never approved of them moving in you know. I still don't know why you wave to them.” Jo-Anne voiced to the room. Maurice wasn't surprised that he still heard that opinion.  He had worked with a few before he retired from the insurance agency and never had been able to understand the fuss some people raised. He knew he had stubborn opinions that wouldn't change anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

His eyes glanced over to Jo-Anne's Ipad. It had lain there for ever it seemed behind a password he didn't know and pictures he wasn't sure he wanted to see.

&#x200B;

.“Glorified solitaire machine and recipe  holder. I still don't know why we bought one. I just gave away 20 dusty cookbooks and I have a drawer full of playing cards that don't need batteries.” Maurice said to the offending tablet. He had refused to charge it and didn't know exactly what he would do with it. He toyed with the idea of using it as a cutting board or serving plate to horrify the grand kids.

“Maurice Jocelyn Gagnon I swear if you threw out my cookbooks you won't hear the end of it. Those where wedding gifts.” The shriek filled the house and Jo-Anne peered through glass panes of the wooden cupboard doors looking at the space the departed would have been kept .With his teacup empty and having a heard time keeping a smile off his face Maurice heaved himself up from the chair and started to get ready to leave. 

&#x200B;

The verbal outrage continued as he placed the saucer and cup on the counter without bothering to rinse them out. As he looked out the window and eyed the clouds and the sun he walked to the door and put on a spring coat , his shoes , and muttering about his poor memory he grabbed a small bag from the kitchen before departing.

&#x200B;

Having a house so close to a park had always been a small source of happiness for Maurice and the family. The walk was close and had allowed the family to get out during the summer and for the last little while it had allowed him to meet with a few other retired types.

&#x200B;

As he made his way up the sidewalk towards the picnic benches he watched familiar faces near the small pond. While his jacket had been zipped up for breeze and the light wind he saw the small children at the pond side mostly clad in summer clothes and two in full winter gear. As he kept walking the path he heard the familiar cries of “Hello Mr Gagnon” but kept his eyes to the path. The pond had always attracted children throughout the years but he wished it would let them leave. One day he may have the strength to help them home but after the last attempt he knew his good intentions never had the results people wanted.

&#x200B;

As he approached the small grouping of tables he waved at some of the familiar faces seated at them. Seeing the group of pigeons gathered he knew he wasn't the only one with the same idea.“Glad to see you Maurice, some sit by me. I still have a few bits of bread left.” A warm voiced called out from the group.

As the voice reached Maurice's ears and his heart quickened for a moment. His eyes where drawn to the speaker and without thinking a smile spread across his face.

“Well hello Vicki. You decided to join us old coots for a spell?” He made his way over to the bench she occupied and sat beside her. As he sat down she moved in closer to him until their legs touched. Maurice suddenly felt as if the light spring jacket had turned into a parka and the fifteen degrees was now thirty.“

Maybe I just wanted to see a familiar face and get out of the house. The grand kids had been over and I felt like I just needed a break. Besides I was hoping to see you.” As the words left Vicki's mouth her hand went his kneecap and gave it a squeeze.

The words Maurice was about to say suddenly stuck to his throat. The temperature again seemed to rise and his tongue seemed to have swelled up. He wasn't sure if he was blushing but as Vicki looked over at him she burst out laughing it confirmed his fear.

After her laughing subsided and Maurice got his thoughts under control he was able to finally get his tongue to work. “Vicki I didn't expect that.”

&#x200B;

“Oh and why is that? Grabbing your knee can't get you that excited. If it does I may have to do it again.”“No no... it's just.... it's been a while. I don't know how to....” His tongue seemed to swell up again as he tried to find the right words.
