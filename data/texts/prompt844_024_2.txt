I nod to my coworkers with a little yawn, heading in to check my assignment. I had a feeling in my gut that I knew what it would be, I had heard some whispers...

And, upon logging into a terminal, there it was. 071 duty. I knew that would happen when word got around.

Nobody knows what 071 will do with someone like me. No sexual desires, of any kind, ever. I knew they've been dying to find out, and, if I'm being honest... that's why I've been trying not to come out to anybody at work. I'd take cleaning up after the worst of them if it meant they wouldn't guinea pig me out to 071.

I sigh softly, trying desperately to get some kind of coffee into my Foundation mug, but, with no luck, toss it aside and slowly make my way to the cell where they keep 071.

I'm met outside in the security section, and glimpse the camera on 071, sighing deeply as they begin to measure me to find a suit to fit me.

"Don't complain, you could be D-Class. At least we'll try and protect you from... whatever it does with you." The scientist smiles reassuringly at me. Somehow, I am not reassured by that.

"If anything. It might not want anything to do with you," another adds, also not helping the situation.

I sigh deeply, again, nodding slowly. "I know. Not like I really had a choice anyways." I get suited up, turning towards the door, bracing myself.

The door opens remotely, with the others away from it to keep 071 from getting any ideas. I, myself, set my jaw and walk in.

This is the worst FUCKING day of my life and I know there's going to be more to follow here, no matter the results of this test.
