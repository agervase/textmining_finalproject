"Who could have done this?" A whole crowd of people are gathered around the empty vault. They're all slack jawed and wide eyes as they stare at what should be an impossible sight. This is one of the largest and most importantly safest of banks in the world. Security here is top notch, state of the art even (all down to me of course). Yet the sight is no lie, it's clear as day for all to see. Not a penny, not a note, not even a speck of dust is left. It's all gone.

Well I suppose I could make this easy for them. Being rich is fine and all but the thrill is in the suspense, that feeling that you could be caught at any second. I cough, catching the groups attention, and step forward with a devilish smile on my face.

"That would be me." I grin.

"What...what do you mean 'that would be you'?" Asks my co-worker.

"Yep. Just a quick in and out. Few bags at a time, pretty simple actually. A fortune like that stacks up well in a moving van." I explain.

"Damn it women this is serious." My boss barks.

"So am I." I shurg.

"If she's going to treat this like a joke I want her off of the scene." The chief officer mumbles.

"I agree. Get out of here. Go home." My boss orders.

"Yes, Sir." I nod and turn away. I struggle to conceal a smirk as I walk to the exit. By tonight I'll be far away from here with the riches of the wealthy lining my pocket. And victory was so, so easy. The same trick I learned when I was five works today better than ever. After all, the one thing people distrust most in the world is honesty.
