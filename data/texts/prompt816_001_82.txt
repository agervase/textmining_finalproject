The young rogue entered the lavish private bar his father owned, chuckling with his closest henchmen as he walked he made his way to the bar.

&#x200B;

Spotting his father leaning against the bar the man heads directly towards him with an over confident smirk across his face..

&#x200B;

"Father, pour me a drink will you?"

&#x200B;

"Yeah.." His Father sighed as he poured the whiskey, the same drink he had poured himself moments earlier.

&#x200B;

The young man had always respected, feared his father. For as long as he can remember his Father was always the man to call the shots, he never quivered, he never faltered and he was never shook.

But in this moment his Father looked like a stranger.

&#x200B;

As he handed his son the drink, a flash of movement and his clenched fist was pummeled into his son's gut, practically lifting him off the floor, the whiskey landed on the floor with a smash followed by his son on his knees.

&#x200B;

"ooomph......W..why father?" The young man grimaced recoiling from the blow from his father

&#x200B;

"You fuckin' know why" His Father spat

&#x200B;

"The car?  The old man's car?" He looked up at his father, slightly confused

&#x200B;

"Not just the car.." The man rolled up his sleeves, still standing over his son who's attempting to regain his composure but failing.

&#x200B;

"The old man?" He asked

&#x200B;

"Careful, that man was not far from your Father's age, yes the man. Tell me, did you extend the same courtesy to his pet?" As he asked this he made eye contact with his son for the first time since he entered the room.

&#x200B;

Looking at his feet "No Father, it was just a fuckin' dog....why would i waste my time on... a" his sentence was broken by his Father

&#x200B;

"Because THAT 'Fuckin' dog was John Lick...."  His Father bit back.

&#x200B;

Looking puzzled at his Father, his Father continued to explain.

&#x200B;

"John Lick is the fuckin' BowWow Man...He was sent to Vietnam to take down the dog meat trade, he had 417 confirmed kills and 89 Official Good Boys which is unheard of. He killed more traders with claws, teeth and furious tail wagging than any other dog pound unit sent into enemy territory!"

&#x200B;

He pours himself another drink...

&#x200B;

"After he finished cleaning up Vietnam he came home, found an owner and began looking for work"

&#x200B;

"What kind of work?" The young man now nestled on a barstool, lights a cigarette between shaking hands.

&#x200B;

"Guess.." His father takes another sip of his Whiskey

&#x200B;

"Oh.." The young man looks down again, realising the weight of his actions..

&#x200B;

"And you.....you steal his owners car.....you KILL his fuckin' owner.......and then you spared fuckin' John Lick...until further notice you are under house arrest until he is sent to doggy heaven.."

&#x200B;

And with that off in the distance a window smashes.....a guard screams in agonising pain....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
