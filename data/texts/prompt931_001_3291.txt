So get a load of this. I had this idea.  I was thinking, how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century?   
I thought, hey, a sperm whale---   
It started with a sperm whale anyway. I was just going to drop a *sperm whale* on him. Then I realized, I wasn't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty. *Anyone* can drop something on someone. Hell, the third winner used an ambulance. Points for creativity *and* irony that year.   
Then, I figured it out. An *homage* to the old days of this noble sport.   
So I went back to a further time, earlier in the era. Found this old man, and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me.   
Here's where we pick up the pace.     
I asked him about *Adolf Hitler's* paintings. He thought out loud as old men always do (even in the 20th century!) and said, he never heard of him, but the painting technique was "disappointing."  
Then I asked him to repeat himself, and say, "Adolf Hitler's art, was disappointing."    
So he did.  
I asked him to *yell* it, tell all who would hear a master's opinion of this work.   
*JUST* as he was about to respond, I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later. You can see this old man *zooming* down into the sky. In the tape, you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows. *That's* when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above.  
You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the *exact* velocity to get the old man's adrenaline going, give him time to speak, and have Hitler hear him.  
And there! That's how I pulled it off.  
I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol, Rudolf von Alt, far above his head, *while* he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler's paintings for all of Berlin to hear. It was the last thing he ever heard.    
And Rudolf called his paintings *crap!*  
The bonus points for intricacy *and* emotional devastation got me the victory.
