The young boy sat under the tree, seemingly enjoying the sunshine if you failed to notice the silent years streaming down his cheeks. His tiny frame didn't move as he sat, hugging his legs and silently saying goodbye to a life he had loved dearly. Hundreds of lives had left him cold and hard to the realities of life, yet Sarah had changed that. For one brief glimpse in time he had explored love and happiness again. 

Now, placed inside yet another body, he mourned for what was lost. His children, grandchildren, and soon great grandchildren were gone. Never could he contact them, feel the warmth of a family he raised. It was simply too painful to do so. 

Nearby he glanced over as he noticed some birds chasing a squirrel away from their tree. A small smile found his lips. Some things never change. And at least he would enjoy a decade of childhood before remembering. Already he could feel the soul of this body pressing on his own, seeking to join and become one. His week long pass to mourn and remember was almost over. 

He stood, then, as the press became greater. With urgency this boy's soul sought his own. Not to expel, but to conjoin. Ten years as a carefree boy in rural America isn't so bad. Steeling himself, he took a deep breath. This would be the last time he remembered who he really was until his fifteenth birthday. But there were parents who would love him. As his consciousness fades, he silently whispers to the wind, "goodbye Sarah. I love you now, and for all the eternities of my lives.". 

A breeze blew through the boys hair who turned to face it and smiled. Spying the squirrel he began to laugh before hearing his mother's call for supper. Hoping fervently that she made lasagna, he runs to the house.
