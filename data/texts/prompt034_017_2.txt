I'd been waiting for this moment for... well, my entire life. When my brother died, my faith in an afterlife died with him. I couldn't picture anything but nothingness - whatever that looks like - after my own death. It scared the shit out of me. But now, I'm in the afterlife, and with a book of not just my story, but what it could have been like. 

I know exactly what I'd want to change. It's the one thing I'd regretted for decades, the one thing that I wish I could turn back time for. I flip frantically through the book, catching glimpses of my childhood, adult life, and elderly years as I searched for the right page. My heart jumps as I accidentally flip past the words I was looking for. I quickly go back and slap my hand on the page I need. 

*Peter says goodbye and makes his way to the car. You: a) go inside; b) wave goodbye; c) hug him.* 

The first option is out of character for me, and the second was what I chose. Now, I choose the third. 

*For c): "See you next week!" Peter says, waving to you and your parents. Your mother and father wave back, smiling contentedly, as you walk up to your brother. You wrap your arms around him, pressing your head into his chest and holding him tight. "I love you, Pete," you murmur. Surprised, Peter chuckles at your sudden outpouring of emotion. But then you feel him hug you back, holding you in a strong and genuine embrace. "I love you too, Ali."* 

I skim the lines describing the rest of my day, because I know it hasn't changed anything. Skipping the mundane details brings me to the morning of the next day. My heart races in anticipation. 

*Peter looks at the photo of you and himself sticking your tongues out at the camera. He remembers how happy your parents looked to see him today, and your "I love you" echoes in his mind. He gets up to go to the kitchen and suddenly collapses. His roommates rush over to him and call an ambulance, but nothing can be done. He has died of an aneurysm.* 

A sob catches in my throat. This is it. This is all I wanted. Even though I didn't live Peter's life, it showed me the part of it I needed to see, which is inexplicably missing in all other paths. I slam the book closed and let the bittersweet feelings take over. In reality, I didn't change anything; I can only hope he knew how much I loved him. 

I'm going to find him.
