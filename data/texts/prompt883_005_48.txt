Congressman Derek F. Ackerman sat at the ornate wood desk in his oversized hotel room, disinterestedly flipping through debate notes. He couldn't help but pause and take in the irony of his room. *"Presidential Suite...I didn't even know they could upgrade rooms."* 

&nbsp;
By all accounts he should have felt positively confident. His opponent had just dropped a baby at the handshake line outside. Not only that, the candidate's response was to feverishly claim that the baby had been "unbearably heavy".

&nbsp;
One does not win a presidential debate after dropping someone's fat toddler in front of the news trucks. Sorry, allegedly fat. Regardless, Congressman Ackerman did not feel particularly lucky today. He glanced over at his wife, sitting pensively on the lavish king bed.

&nbsp;
As Derek's mind wandered between focusing on work and growing bored from confidence, his old friend sadness began to work it's way onto the mental itinerary. As if coming to the rescue, his chief strategist Keith Greer suddenly knocked and poked his head in the room. 

&nbsp;
"Hey Congressman. They need you backstage in 15. We're about to get started," said Keith. It was fortunate he showed up and pulled him back down the present. Derek knew he had to focus on the evening's event. 

&nbsp;
This was the third presidential debate between Derek and Republican Sen. John Williamson. In the first debate one ABC moderator nearly choked to death, but not before Derek and the Heimlich maneuver intervened. Needless to say, the standing ovation went over well with the audience at home. 

&nbsp;
The second debate had been more subtle. During a sensitive back and forth on the topic of abortion, Senator Williamson suddenly developed a facial tick where he kept, or so it seemed, *winking* at the audience. Some pundits called the series uncomfortable. They were vastly understating the atter. Polls showed an unsurprisingly brutal skyrocket in the poor man's unfavorables. 
&nbsp;
Now the Senator was set to go a third time. He was tenacious if nothing else. 

&nbsp;
Derek noticed Keith still lingering by the door. 

&nbsp;
"Something else you need, Keith?" he asked. 

&nbsp;
The long time political operator shifted uncomfortably. 

&nbsp;
"Well....this is kindof a grey area. But CBS accidentally cc'd one of our staffers a copy of the moderators' debate questions. Do you want to know?" 

&nbsp;
Derek thought for a second. It's not like there'd be any consequences if he went with it. There never were. 

&nbsp;
Derek nodded, "Yeah, why not. Anything I should look out for?" 

&nbsp;
His strategist paused, "Well they're going to ask Williamson about all the new affair allegations..." 

&nbsp;
Derek suspected that would come up. Sen. John Williamson was enduring quite unfortunate timing with all these accusations. He wondered if any of them were true. 

&nbsp;
The strategist continued, more cautiously now, "...and one moderator will want to know your fondest memory of Marissa before she got sick." 

&nbsp;
No sooner had her name rolled off Keith's tongue than Derek slumped into his chair and fell into a deeply distant gaze. His eyes glistened just a touch, threatening a high chance of precipitation. 

&nbsp;
"This should be a softball question," thought Keith. He knew the Congressman quite well. And glancing over at his wife's still, unmoving form it was easy to understand how his boss could get shaken up over her condition. But politically, she was a godsend, though Representative Ackerman could never really see it that way. 

&nbsp;
"Sir..." Keith said gently, shocking Derek out of his momentary trance. 

&nbsp;
The congressman slowly straightened up, wiped the back of his hand across his face, and stood. 

&nbsp;
He spoke, somber gravity weighing down every word, "Thank you. I'll be down in 5." 

&nbsp;
"Sure you're alright sir?" 

&nbsp;
"Yeah, I'll be fine...Just give me a minute." 

&nbsp;
The congressman looked around the lavish hotel room as Keith hesitantly turned to go. Derek calmed down a bit. He couldn't help but notice Keith's furtive glance toward Marissa on his way out.

&nbsp;
With a loud **clack** the door closed, and Derek walked over to the bed a crumpled down onto it, next to Marissa. The campaign was perpetually baffled by her presence in trail. But Congressman Derek Ackerman would not be parted with his wife.

&nbsp;
She sat totally still, back against the headboard. Her medical assistant (he unfortunately couldn't attend to all of her needs) had dressed her in the lovely old blue gown today, and draped a thin silver necklace around her neck. 

&nbsp;
It was hard to tell when she was awake or asleep, since there was almost no distinction. The doctors called it 'Coma Creep.' They were able to name it, but unable to explain it. 

&nbsp;
In just a few short years she had become blind, deaf, and mute. Her entire nervous system shut down, and most of her muscle mass had all but withered away. She probably couldn't taste anything either, but since everything worked through IV's no one bothered to test. She also had some oddly acute skin decay. One part of her face had rotted to black, in an eerily near perfect resemblance to a swastika. The unsightliness hurt the natural charisma she had with sympathy voters. So they covered that part of her face in bandages. She was hard on the eyes, and even worse for morale. 

&nbsp;
Yet still, in this moment, Derek stared at her. He saw none of the special "flaws." Instead he saw the memory, his memory, of the beautiful girl he'd grown up with and married.

&nbsp;
The world looked at Derek Ackerman and saw the youngest congressman in history, the most successful public activist in America, a lottery winner who donated everything to charity, and probably the next and most beloved leader of the free world. 

&nbsp;
If he were less lucky with press coverage, they would have seen the real Derek: a simple man haunted by a ghost. 

&nbsp;
Doubt crept in. He wondered if he should've tried to put more into Luck. If he and Marissa should have forgotten their ambition and lived in peace. If they had made a mistake. They had both been so sure of themselves, they had planned so throughly before the re-alignment process. He even waited for her birthday, so they could go in together. He was afraid then. 

&nbsp;
Derek brushed his hand through her hair, "I'm still afraid, Ryss," he managed. When his sadistic mind reminded himself that she'd never respond again, laugh again, smile again, or mess his hair... He was fortunate to let loose only a few brimming tears.

&nbsp;
*At least she still has her hair. I guess I'm lucky for that,* he thought. 

&nbsp;
Silver lining aside, here he was. Alone. Always alone since the re-alignment. One of two people in the room technically alive. One of one conscious enough to wish they weren't. 

&nbsp;
He took a deep breath. Derek thought about all the good he was doing for the country, and the world. Then another deep breath. It wasn't working. The guilt crashed down. Then habit kicked in, and he reached for the paper that so often comforted him in these moods. 

&nbsp;
He pulled the old, wrinkled paper out of its home in the suit's chest pocket. It had been home in every suit Derek wore since he received the letter. Since the day before he and Marissa wed. Three days before re-alignment. And for what it's worth, the letter was the closest thing Derek would have to a real home. He read it carefully.
