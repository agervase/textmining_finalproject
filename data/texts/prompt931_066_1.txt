"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to present 'Talking 33 Pi', our newest show dedicated to discussing the 'Time Travel- Survivor series- Killing Hitler 33-52, I am here with last years winner to discuss how he killed Hitler, let me introduce to you Ice Man. Tell me your story."

"It wasn't just about killing Hitler, it was about killing him, and engineering it so that it looked like an accident." 

"So tell me,how did you design your plans?"

"Well it was easy, I went back to 42, and I watched Hitler from a distance on multiple occasions as a member of his orderly staff. Well I watched him for about a month during his frequent visits to the Wolf's Lair on the eastern front during the campaign against Russia. I was just looking for a moment where Hitler would lose his balance, just one moment, a slip up, trip, or a moment where he fell down."

"But the key was that it needed to be timed, and all probabilities measured out. I recorded one slip up on December 7th, 1944 with my Iris camera, while Hitler was walking out of the Wolf's lair. I guess he was mad, and was raging after having been told by Field Marshal Manstein that the situation in Stalingrad was hopeless. Well anyways, there it was, Hitler trips over a camouflage canopy post, and almost falls down. 

"In World War Two-Reality Alpha Six, Hitler manages to catch his fall in this moment. So what did you do differently?

"This time in Reality Alpha Seven I went to the spot where Hitler slipped, and added ice to the equation of probabilities in the general area where Hitler would catch his fall. I used the ice as the catalyst, measured to the point that in Alpha Seven, Hitler would trip, but not catch his fall, and instead slip. I used a quantum probability generator, and I placed a series of rocks around the spots where Hitler had the best chance of falling and hitting his head. And the rest is history"

" And that's why they call you the Ice Man ladies and gentlemen. Bravo!"
