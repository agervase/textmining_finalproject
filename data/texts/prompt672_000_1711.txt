As the dust settled and the screaming stopped, Gordon and his crew surrounded the small spacecraft that had interrupted the lunch session at The Pink Flamingo restaurant in Miami. Luckily, the spacecraft didn't hit anyone, but it had torn a massive hole in the ceiling of the quaint Caribbean themed dining room. The owner, a middle aged balding man with a thick Cuban accent, was on the verge of angry tears as he looked at the UFO in front of him.

Suddenly, the top of the spacecraft popped open with a puff of smoke, and a short, stocky grey alien, no taller than two feet, stepped out onto the floor. It looked around at the mess it made, and looked up at Gordon and the owner of the restaurant. Its pitch-black eyes that took up half its face were wide with shock, and it then fell on its knees and garbled incoherently, seemingly apologising for the trouble it caused.

"When I came to this restaurant," Gordon said to the camera man next to him, "I never expected a disaster quite like this. \*\*\*\* me."

Gordon then turned to the alien.

"Well, now that you're here, you might as well show what you can do in the kitchen." Gordon walked over and sat at one of the dining tables that was still standing, wiped the dust off the top, and looked eagerly at the alien.

Despite not knowing a word of English, the alien took this cue to dive back into its spacecraft and pulled out a green-ish chicken-like animal, and waddled over to the kitchen. The cameramen crowded around Gordon's table, and the producers told the owner and staff of the restaurant to carry on as normal, saying "Don't worry about the damages, we'll pay for it when we renovate the restaurant in a few days time."

Inside the kitchen, the line cooks started preparing the weird alien chicken that the alien had provided, nodding along to its garbled commands. Gordon waited outside, doing his usual routine of complaining about the decor, chatting with the waitstaff, filling in time as the other cameramen walked around the restaurant filming B-roll.

Finally, after about 20 minutes, a young waitress walked out with the strange green concoction of alien and domestic ingredients.

Gordon thanked the waitress, and began reviewing the dish.

"Wow. \*\*\*\* me. The presentation is hideous. Too much green." He grabbed a blob of fat. "Not looking forward to eating this \*\*\*\*\*\*\*."

He cut a bit of the meat off the bone, and plopped it in its mouth.

"Wow, this is \*\*\*\*. It like I'm eating lemon skin and jelly, with a strong garlic aftertaste. I've never had meat this hideous before. This is new to me."

The waitress came over, smiled sweetly, and asked "How is everything?"

"Hideous," Gordon replied frankly. "One of the worst dishes I've had in my life."

"Want me to take it away?"

"Please." Gordon drank from his glass of water as the waitress grabbed the plate and took it away. She went inside the kitchen, where the alien was waiting.

"It was bad. He didn't like it," She said. The alien garbled angrily and threw what was left of the alien chicken carcass into the bin.

Later, Gordon was in the kitchen with the alien and the line cooks.

"Let me tell you, when you crashed your alien spacecraft into the restaurant earlier today, I was actually excited to see what extraterrestrial cuisine was like. I've never had food from your culture, and to be honest, if that is what you call food, I would kill myself if you took over our planet."

The alien looked angry and offended. It couldn't believe its earholes.

"The flavour was off, it wasn't cooked right. It had an awful texture that no human could possibly enjoy."

"I liked it," the restaurant owner interjected.

"Well, maybe you should travel back to the alien's country then, you idiot!" Gordon retorted. 

"\*\*\*\* this, I'm out." The owner replied. The alien also garbled its rejection of the criticism. It stormed back into the dining room where its spaceship was still parked, with the owner in tow. It sat down, patting the space next to it for the owner to come in. The owner squeezed himself into what little space there was before the UFO closed its door, and the spaceship took off, disappearing into space with a puff of smoke.

"Good riddance." Gordon said to the cameraman next to him.
