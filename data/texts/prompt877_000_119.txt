Leroy had been casing this joint for a few weeks now, never seeing anyone enter or leave.  After deciding that this house was definitely just another one of the hundreds of winter homes here in Florida, he packed up his gear and chose his entrance.  Looking around nonchalantly, Leroy smashed open one of the back windows with a brick and climbed inside.

Upon stepping through the window frame, heavy steel curtains covered all windows and doors leading to the outside, lights turned on, and the words "Player 2 has entered the game" echoed around the house.

"The hell-" Leroy was cut short as "Player 1" barreled into him, knocking the wind out of him.  As he lay there gasping for air, Player 1 raised his fist aiming a blow at Leroy's head.  Dodging to the right, Leroy gave the man a swift punch in the gut and pushed him off of him.

Getting to his feet, Leroy ran to the kitchen hoping to find something with which to defend himself.  On the table was a knife, a pistol, and a baseball bat.  Leroy tried to grab the pistol but as he reached for it a number popped up floating in the air above the gun:  "$25".  "Aw are you f--".  Player 1 was back and he beat Leroy on the back of the head with a double-fisted smash.  Dazed, Leroy had just enough cognitive power to decide he wasn't going to play fair with this guy.  Leroy slammed Player 1 right in his unmentionables with a powerful uppercut.  The man doubled over, almost falling on top of Leroy.  An announcement rang out.

"Player 2 has been gifted $5."

Leroy reached this time instead for the knife.  "$5" floated above it and as he moved his hand and grabbed the knife the "$5" disappeared and was replaced with a check mark before fading away.  Another announcement:  "FINISH HIM!"

Leroy had never killed a man before and had no desire to do so now.  However, he saw no other way to escape this hell so he did what he had to do.  He stabbed Player 1 over and over and over again, blood spewing everywhere in thick strings.  A loud fanfare sounded as he dropped the knife and laid back, panting.  The victory bells were more like sirens, but they were still comforting because they meant, he presumed, that he was safe.

==============================

The police arrived moments later to see a man sitting beside a thoroughly destroyed scarecrow decoration in Mrs. Suttertan's kitchen.  The officers searched the man and found several drops of acid in a baggie on his person.  After securing the perp in handcuffs the head officer called up to Mrs. Suttertan:  "it's okay to come down now, you're safe ma'am!  Now could I get a statement from you on exactly what went on here?"

Mrs. Suttertan then proceeded to recount to the officer how the thief broke in via the back window next to the kitchen.  She told the officer how she was cleaning out her attic and was taking an old Halloween decoration downstairs to throw out when she saw the man and dropped the scarecrow.  She told him how the man wrestled drunkenly with the scarecrow for a good 5 minutes until they arrived.  "And well, you see the rest."

"Thank you ma'am," the officer said.  "You did good calling 911 right away.  We'll keep a few extra patrols in this area as a precaution, but you should be safe now."

The officer left the scene, a lesson first learned in 1969 once again reinforced as he looked at the bag of drugs.  Never take the brown acid.
