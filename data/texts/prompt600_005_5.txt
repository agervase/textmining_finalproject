     I was at school, a normal day, like any other. I got bored in class (fucking history) and a small notion to create something new. A language!. It didn't have to be elegant, hell it didn't even have to be completely coherent, I just knew it needed to exist.
     Instead of focusing on class, I dedicated all my time to this new language. I already had the plans laid out in my head, what the alphabet looked like, how each letter looked, how it was vocalized. Everything.
     When the bell rang I had it all scribbled down on a sheet of notebook paper. Now it was lunch time and I was excited to try out this new thing I invented.
     Me and my best friend Dan were walking towards each other in the hall, as always and after approaching him I say in the language "Hey, Dan, what's up?"
     Dan looks at me with a confused expression. He turns away from me and continues on like he's never seen me in his life. After standing there for several seconds trying to peice together what I did to piss him off, a girl down the hall cackles.
     "You too, huh?" She says to me after calming down.
     I send her my own look of confusion, as I had actually never seen her in my life.
      She continued "Do you speak it? The language I mean."
      After several more seconds, a spark of realization fills my eyes and I nod. Assuming she's talking about the one I'd just created, I speak a sentence.
      Another cackle erupts from her mouth. "Oh shit. This is perfect. Absoloutely beautiful."
      "What do you mean?" I ask her
      "You're just like me!"
      "Like you?"
      "Hell yeah like me!"
      "What do you mean?"
      "You're a child of Satan too!"
