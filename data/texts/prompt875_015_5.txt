“Don’t get bit, scratched or make contact. That is certain death”
 Well we already knew that from the movies.

The house finally in view a surge of adrenaline forces me to run faster. Around the house and over the gate. Back kitchen door is always unlocked.
“HOMEISSAFEHOMEISSAFEHOMEISSAFEHOMEISSAFE…”

“They’re slow but they travel in hordes.”
Sure no problem I have a Jeep and they have undead human leg power I’m set.

HUP!
Over the fence!
“ALMOSTHOMEALMOSTHOMEALMOSTHOMEALMOSTHOME…”

“Don’t worry you can identify them not only by that shambling gait but also the loud gurgling, moaning and lets not forget groaning!”
But Hollywood never foresaw intelligence.

The door!
“SAFESAFESAFESAFESAFE!”

       …..mommy…

“SHIT!”
“SLAMITSLAMITSLAMITSLAMIT!!”

I know it’s useless to try to slow my breathing. Try to not be heard. Silence is key but
she’s been on my tail since 6th Avenue. And she knows which house is her’s. 

Piper’s pretty pear tree 


I push my back up against the door and do it anyways.

      Tap-tap-taptaptap

What the fuck was that?

      Tap-tap-taptaptap

Omygodno.

    …...mommy I did it….
     …..I remembereded the secret knock…
     …...I remembereded it mommy….

Hot tears stream down my face.
“That’s good baby, mommy’s proud of you!” 
The praise is just a distraction to keep me from sobbing.

     …..mommy…

Her voice has that rasp to it.
They said the rasp is the telltale sign

      …..mommy,.....
      ……..sounds sad….are…
       ….you sad…..mommy?.......

I’d let her in if I hadn’t already saw her.
If I hadn’t known.
If I hadn’t witnessed.

     ….mommy….?

The school. That fucking school.

      ….mommy…

The second day of the second week of first grade. Nobody expects that day to go wrong do they?

         …...mommymommymommy…..

Sky Blue ribbon in her hair to match her new blue dress. And her cute brand new white light up shoes.

         ….MOMMYMOMMYMOMMYMOMMY…

It was her friend Hayden


         Tap-tap-taptaptap
         Tap-tap-taptaptap

I told her to come back to the car but she saw her friend

      taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptap

            ….MOMMYYY…

And her friend...saw her too..

     **MOMMYMOMMYMOMMYMOMMYMOMMY**

“I'M NOT YOUR MOMMY!”

      ….yesss….
        ..yess you are…


“NO I’M PIPER’S MOMMY.”

       ….i...pipe..err..
         .....mommy….I am….piperrr…
          ….mommy I’m…

“SHUT UP!
YOU’RE NOT!
PIPER’S DEAD!”

Unable to hold back any longer the sobs erupt from me.

All I could do was watch. 
Hayden latched on to my baby and all I did was run back In the car. 
She screamed and screamed for me over and over pleading for her dear mommy to come save her!
Confused as to why her mommy stayed frozen in the car watching horrified as she got devoured.
Hayden didn’t have time to finish before Piper was up and moving again.
She reached towards me with what was left of her left arm.

“My baby girl is dead”

She fell silent as if to ponder this.


**SIE SIND DAS ESSEN  UND WIR SIND DIE JAEGER!**



Guren no Yumiya, David’s ringtone blasted through the silence.

              …..Daddy?.....

“Help.”
