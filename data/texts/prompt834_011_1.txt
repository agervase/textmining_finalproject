The next morning, I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Then I logged onto Discord. I saw a notification from my friend, Tobias, to get a free-to-play game that just came out, called Ironsight. "Ironsight is a free-to-play FPS game that plays a lot like Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Bro, you should get it," my Tobias said. "I know its player base may seem small, but who gives a literal fucck? It's still fun."

&#x200B;

So I went onto [https://ironsight.aeriagames.com/](https://ironsight.aeriagames.com/). After the installation, which took ages to complete, I opened up the game and it prompted me to create a username. Hmmm, I thought, maybe I should make my name SeaWhole. After completing the tutorial, I decided to hit the multiplayer and see what it was like. There were five game modes: Team Deathmatch, Secure Point (basically king of the hill), Resource Takeover, Frontline, and finally the most competitive game mode, Search and Destroy. I clicked on Search and Destroy, because I thought yolo, right?

As soon as I went hopped onto Titan, the smallest map in the game, I remembered last night's tip: always aim for the head. "Okay, stay calm and do your shit," I told myself.

&#x200B;

As each round went by, I continuously aimed for the head. I ended the round with a K/D of 10-1. Not bad, but I've seen better, I thought to myself. After the match was over, Derd, one of my opponents, whispered to me. "Hey, you did pretty good for a beginner," Derd said. "I'm the leader of a competitive Ironsight team and can let you try out."

&#x200B;

"Okay, cool," I said. "My Discord is SeaWhole#6969 *disclaimer: this is not my actual discord, do not contact it*. Message me there."

&#x200B;

I went back to Discord, and accepted Derd's friend request. He then sent me an invite to his team's server, and we went into a voice channel in preparation to play with the team. There was a scrim in 5 minutes against Pandas With Chairs (PWC), the best EU Ironsight team. Following the same tips I received last night, I achieved astounding results in this scrim, too. Derd then told me I was officially on the team.

For the following months, I continued to practice with Derd's team. As we continued to practice, I became so good with the headshots that I became the main SR player on the team and was known as Junior Pamaj. In these months, Ironsight's community rapidly grew, too, giving the Esports scene a lot more competitive and higher stakes. Finally, the first qualifiers for the offline tournament came around, and was planned to be held in Suzhou, China with a total prizepool money consisting of six figures. There were 4 qualifiers per region (NA, EU, SA, KR/CN). This meant that a total of 16 teams would be in the tournament... We went into qualifier B of the EU region, and after absolutely demolishing the other teams in the same qualifier, we happily earned our spot at the offline tournament. To be continued...
