Hopped out the trees yo
about a quarter million years ago
chilled in africa carvin' rocks and spears
for the next two hundred thousand years

Then out of Africa we went 
to every other continent
Started planting different crops
and raising yummy livestock

killed off all the mastodon 
by the time the iron age had come
nomads no more and no more caves 
and then we reached the copper age

Neanderthals were now all gone 
by the time we reached the age of bronze
The egyptians and babylonians 
built cities where their rivers run

They also built some pyramids
just like the maya and aztec did
Then came the greeks and then came rome
to the far east arose the jin and song

for a thousand years the empire reigned
until those nasty germans came
and sometime in there there would be
a belief called christianity

The light of Rome could not be saved
So began the darker age
with very little progress made
christians and all their crusades

vikings sailed out from the norse
sacking cities along the rivers' course
further east mighty islam rose
Mongols protected the great silk road

The silk road goods the asians made
But also brought the dreaded plague
millions died could not be saved
kept humans in a darker age

Then humans started getting smart
so began the renaissance  
it saw new thoughts of life and arts
and a great age of exploration start

This saw a little island conquer
Just about the entire world
But while England thought they were the best 
It was spain who finally sailed west

Columbus said the world was round 
thats how the new world was found
there were some native people there 
but they killed them off, they didn't care

So while Europe warred every year or two
America, it slowly grew
Soon they thought it would be cool
To rid themselves of british rule

From france came one Napoleon
Who fought with just about everyone
He went all the way to Russia too 
but was done in for good at Waterloo 

Then in America came civil war 
The likes of which had never seen before
The north won and freed the slaves
But the world was in for bloodier days

The Great war in early 1900's 
Saw many men all blown asunder
This new warfare had heavy costs
Eventually the Germans lost

Hit with terms that really hurt
they soon came back and conquered europe
The whole world was soon involved
Until the yankees dropped the bomb

Things would never be as they were before 
after the second world war
The US had nukes so did the reds
Enough to make everybody dead

And so a new type of war took hold
Not one that's hot but one thats cold
The world stood at the 11th hour
At the mercy of Nuclear super powers

The Iron curtain made things fucked
but it was certain communism sucked 
people would rather be free
though it took till 89 to see

So the US came out on top 
But just like Rome, they're on the clock
