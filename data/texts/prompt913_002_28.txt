"Excuse me?" I said, astonished. "You, *the* Satan, want me to help you conquer hell? Aren't you in charge of hell?"

&#x200B;

Satan shifted uneasily. "Well, I was, but with every dictator, warlord, and misunderstood artist being sent down there, I couldn't control them as easily as I would have liked. When I tried to enforce my iron will, they pushed back with their steel."

&#x200B;

"Interesting. Well, sell me. I want to know why I shouldn't just take the easy path up heaven and live out forever in peace, instead of working my ass off trying to control the worst people ever." I spread my arms. "I mean, look around. We aren't even in heaven yet, and it's already so beautiful."

&#x200B;

We were in a square room with a window on each wall, but no doors. If you looked out of the windows, you could see anything that you wanted to, depending on what you were thinking about. So far, I had seen my funeral, my house, my family, and Niagara Falls, which I had always wanted to see. The room was also nicely furnished. It had a modest, but functional, interior with a desk dividing the room. I sat on one side and Satan sat on the other.

&#x200B;

"Well," Satan said, squirming in the white armchair, "my way you get a nice challenge to work on for all eternity, endlessly planning to destroy any rebellions and cage the evil people. In heaven, you don't get to do anything. You sit and sing, sit and sing, sit and sing some more. Heavenly voices get tiring, you know.

&#x200B;

"My way, you get to live forever doing puzzles you love, just like when you were alive. After all, if you didn't love puzzles, why would you be so good at your job?"

&#x200B;

I walked over to the window and though about Hell. I looked out and saw demons screeching as Richard Nixon speared them on his sword, quickly followed by Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan. The demons screeched and ran as fast as they could, but they were surprised by Hitler holding a gun. The demons were destroyed by the four villains. Richard Nixon pointed his sword towards a castle in the distance and the other three shouted with him, "Conquest!"

&#x200B;

"Fine, I'll do it. I can't promise I will do it well, but I'll do it."

&#x200B;

"Finally!" Satan's voice boomed, scaring me. I turned away from the window and watched Satan expand from a normal human being into a red, smoky creature twice my size. "Now, supposedly you're good, but I haven't seen you myself. Your first test is, escape!" Satan grabbed me and the room disappeared, melting away into a barred cage in the midst of hell.

&#x200B;

"These people know why you're in this cage." Satan smiled. "Escape and you can conquer Hell for me. Stay, and you will become another one of the tormented in Hell. Bye." Satan disappeared, and I realized I was in the scene in the window before. *But where is Nixon?* I thought, right before my skull got caved in by a sword.
