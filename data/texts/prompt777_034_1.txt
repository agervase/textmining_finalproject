Tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day I finally break this dammed empire for good. For too long has the emperor reigned his terror on the people. For too long, we have suffered, but tomorrow it all ends.

"Sir, your tea is ready." My servant stepped into the room. "Lovely, Cornelius. Now may you leave? I request some privacy." "Why, of course, sir." As he left the room I giggled quite a bit. No one in the palace knows a thing! This is going to be my big moment: Men will want to be me, women would want to date me and I will become the new leader. Everyone would love me and I will finally stand at the top of the mountain and be able to look down on all the others. But that's tomorrow. There's still some work for today.

"Davit, have you got the tool?" I asked my good friend, the local blacksmith. "Oh, yes, I have worked on it for an entire year! Now it's sharpened, shined and ready to go!" He handed me the custom made sword. "Yes, it's ready." "Wow, Harry, I can't believe it's actually happening." "Tomorrow, Davit, tomorrow. I will put this very sword through the Emperor's neck and slice it wide open. His blood will spread everywhere as a symbol to the new era!" "Strong words you got, Harry, but can you back them up?" "I have been training for this my entire life. I've excelled in multiple sword competitions and I got to my position by defeating the Emperor's right hand. I am beyond ready. My journey is coming to an end and you can bet all of your property that I will come out victorious!" "Ok, Harry, you said it."

I made my way back to the palace, with the sword safely placed in a hidden sheath. (sorry I stop here but I'm stuck, will be back with more)
