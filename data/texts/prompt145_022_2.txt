“You know they are getting ready to go. We have to say goodbye.” Ali says as she reaches up to rub the fuzzy cat on the wall. 

It’s moving day and the new place in the country will be too far away for her to visit this place. Whisk had been with Ali since she was three years old, always there for a cuddle and ready to chase anything he deemed threatening. 

“The new place will have grass, fields, warm fires. If you would just let me pick you up Whisk, I’m sure I could sneak you in my bags.” Ali says while trying to pick him up.

Whisk, however, has different ideas about that. Moving smoothly out of Ali’s reach he takes one last look at her before running back into a hole. Ali had found his ‘home’ shortly after meeting him. Located in a hidden area of the garden it had become a refuge for her whenever she wanted to be alone. Whisk never allowed her to be truly alone. 

600 km is too far for her to go on a bike. 14 and about to be the new kid in small country town where she knows no one. She has to be strong, or risk breaking down entirely.  

With a final glance at the hole Whisk ran into, Ali leaves for the car. Never to visit the Place again.

*“She might be able to open it.”*
*“And what if she is? Once they start opening we can’t control them anymore, what comes through them isn’t always what we are expecting, there aren’t any guardians left.”*
*“We have no choice; we’ve been alone for too long!”*
*“Fine! I shall guide her, if she can hear me.”*

It has been four weeks since Ali and her family moved into the new house. Nothing feels the same here, Ali described it as warm but empty. “It’s just because Whisk isn’t here Ali, it’ll get better.” Her mother says every time Ali gets a bit sad. 

“You keep saying that mum, but I am sure that it’s more than that. I keep hearing something, almost like a whisper.” Ali says as her mother unloads a load of laundry. 

She has been hearing things all over the house, especially at night when everyone else was asleep. Ali has also seen several lizards scurrying about her room, she swears that one is always staring at her. 

“Besides, I said goodbye to Whisk before we left. I never heard whispers over there either, he always ate the lizards that seem to taking over my room as well!” 

“Well, maybe we can get a new cat, house train her. She could sleep with you and keep the lizards away.” A new load of laundry is being put in the machine.

“No, a new cat won’t replace Whisk. I’m going for a walk and maybe see if he followed us into the middle of nowhere.” Ali more or less mumbles as she leaves the kitchen. 

*“You must follow me!”* 

*“Please, you aren’t hearing random voices!”*

There it was again, whispers when no one was close. Ali had been trying to get away from more than just the house, but outside it seemed like the whispers were somehow more intense. “If you want me to follow, then show yourself! My ears can’t follow soft whispers!” 

*“Finally, you ask that! Hold still let me get on you.” What the hell is that on my pants.* 

Looking at her leg Ali sees that familiar lizard crawling up her leg. *“You know a pair of jeans would’ve been easier to climb. Don’t shake the leg!”* Just before she flicked it off. That lizard just talked. 

“So what are you?”

*“I am obviously a lizard, and old one at that. Now walk straight into the woods until I tell you to turn.”*

With nothing better to do Ali did as the supernatural-has-to-die-freak-of-nature reptile on her shoulder told her to do. The woods were still something that Ali had to get used to. No traffic at night or random speeding car’s, just the silence of bugs and animals yelling at each other. 

*“We’re almost there. You can slow down a bit.”*

“Easy for you to say, I’m either going crazy or have fallen into a coma.”

*“I assure you that you are neither crazy nor in a coma.”*

“Then why am I taking instructions from lizards sitting on my shoulders?”

*“That you will soon see. We have arrived, see that piece of wood over there, see if you can remove it.”*

Huh, that looks kind of like a cork. Pulling as hard as she can, after a few minutes, Ali finally gets the thing out. Revealing nothing but a hole.

“So what’s supposed to be in there? More lizards?”

*“No, it should be shining if you are who we think you are.”*

“Who is we?”

**“They, my dear, are the lizards council and they were supposed to keep the portals closed and guarded as I have been doing for thousands of years.”** An almost feline voice coming from the hole explains.

“Uhm, portals? Portals to where exactly?” Ali asks while poignantly trying to get the lizards off.

*“The…..Portals……To…..the…..magic……PLEASE STOP SHAKING! The portals to the magical realms. It’s where all the magic creatures were hidden by Merlin!”*

**“Yes, and he asked us to take care of his lineage, not use them to open up portals.”** The feline voice coming from the hole explains. 

“I’ve never had protection before though, and this hole is the first I have seen of this.” 

With a feline purr a shape starts emerging from the hole. **“So you never wondered how a cat survived for that long and somehow stayed active?”** Ali recognised that shape.
