  “Wiln,” my colleague Celsula laughed, as she breezed into our shared  workspace, and placed a handful of papers on my desk in front of me.  “I have another crazy story for you to read, and you need to tell me after you read it whether you think it’s from the Bible or not.” Her black eyes danced with mirth. 

“I already know, from that look on your face,” I smiled at her, “that it 100% will be an excerpt from the sacred book itself. Otherwise you’d never be so excited about it.”

“Oh,” she giggled. “You think you’re so clever, don’t you. Now that I’ve got you believing you know my tricks, it would be a great time for me to change it up, you know. I could throw in something from the surrealists. Or maybe something written by an even crazier earthly cult. You know, something to keep those antennae of yours swiveling in the air.”

Celsula had been playing a version of this game with me all summer. We’d drawn the short straw with our summer research project this year- our professor was very fond of making us select our projects through archaic earthly rituals, for some reason, and about two minutes after we’d found out what “short straws” were, Celsula and I found ourselves holding them in our hands.

“The Bible,” our professor had cheered, as everyone else in the group had literally picked “anything not the Bible.” 

“Aren’t you two lucky,” he grinned at us. 

We groaned. No one had wanted the Bible. Not that anyone had read it, but it was supposed to be very long, and more than a little useless and crazy. When we’d been hired for these summer research positions, we knew we’d be holed up in the library all day every day for every morning and afternoon of that sweltering summer. The Earth Studies department at the University of Vuethuso, on Aorq planet, outer ring of the Andromeda Galaxy, had a summer program devoted to studying obscure historic Earthly literature. We, as history students, in one of the smallest and most underfunded departments of the university, knew that we were lucky to get paid to study something, anything at all. But the Bible? 

I looked over at the bastard who’d selected the Talmud, who’d looked relieved; the girl who’d drawn the Guru Granth Sahib looked positively gleeful.

“Since it’s so long,” our professor continued, “You’ll work on it together, you and Celsula, Wiln, and  you’ll divide the books of this work fairly between yourselves.”

So we had. I didn’t know Celsula very well, when we started to read together, but I sure did now. At first, I hadn’t thought I’d get on with her very well: she was so quiet, and I was more of a class clown. Additionally, she was one of the pale ones – her skin was so light, it was almost chartreuse, and I frowned, as I considered how, for so many centuries, we’d looked down on people like her: it was considered more beautiful to have rich, emerald skin, the proper colour of all things living and flourishing. 

But she’d grown on me. She was so focused, and so driven, I found myself shamed into ploughing through the endless chapters of the book just to keep up with her. If it weren’t for her, I thought to myself, I wouldn’t have got half as much work done.

And she made it fun, a lot of the time. She would laugh hysterically at some things: the story of creation, for one. 

“Seven days,” she laughed to herself. “Seven days, this sky-god takes, to make everything by hand. No- “ she corrected herself – “*Six* days, and on the seventh, he rests. I tell you, these earth-people are *obsessed* with making things, and they have a completely unrealistic grasp of timelines.” 

“Primitive logic,” I laughed, along with her. “Remember when we found the Voyager capsule, filled with little cartoon drawings of their kind and childish things like *music,* as if these diversions communicated essential things about their people?”

“Ohhh,” Celsula had said, as if I’d struck her. “Don’t attack the Voyager! It’s a romantic project, not only a scientific one. And in that way, it perfectly represents who they are, don’t you think?”

That was who she was: someone obsessed with the romantic and impractical. That was the reason she, as she’d said, had become so interested in studying the “little Taupe people,” as she liked to call them, though that was a pejorative, I reminded her now.  The more alien and bizarre their logic, the more she seemed to delight in it. 

Ever since she’d found out, as a young child, that there actually existed a planet of people, coloured in the dull brown shades of the ground and trees themselves, who evidently lived to imagine things and build things, instead of model mathematical scenarios of every hypothetical possibility, often to the complete paralysis of action, as we did on Aorq, she’d been entranced. 

And, lately, she’d been betting with me over whether I could correctly identify actual excerpts from the Bible. She’d fooled me a couple of times: after reading the Book of Ezekiel, I did confuse Borges’ “The Circular Temple” for one of the tamer works of prophetic revelation. She loved to rub that one in. 

My mouth twitched, as I started to read the excerpt in front of me: 

*Behold, you are beautiful, my love;*  
  *behold, you are beautiful;*  
  *your eyes are doves.*

*Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful.*  
 *Our couch is green;*  
 *the beams of our house are cedar;*  
  *our rafters are pine.*

I burst out laughing, trying to stifle my voice from carrying into the next room, and failing utterly. 

“Ok, you’re right – this is really weird,” I choked out. “Does this human have an architecture fetish? “Ohh, what a sexy roof,” says this guy. ‘Let’s kiss and I’ll stare up at it and describe it instead of you.’ 

“I know,” Celsula said, wiping tears from her eyes. “Keep going. Wait until you get to the part with the sheep.”

“The sheep?”

*Your eyes are doves*  
  *behind your veil.*  
 *Your hair is like a flock of goats*  
  *leaping down the slopes of Gilead.*  
 *Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes*  
  *that have come up from the washing,*  
 *all of which bear twins,*  
  *and not one among them has lost its young.*  
 *Your lips are like a scarlet thread,*  
  *and your mouth is lovely.*  
 *Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate*  
  *behind your veil.*

“Doves,” I spluttered. “Goats. And Sheep! Sheep-teeth, that are like female sheep, pregnant with twins!” I laid my head down on the desk and gasped with laughter. “What in the galaxy is wrong with these people?

“You weren’t impressed by the pomegranate cheeks?” she giggled. “Or that the hair – leaps somehow? With goatlike motion?”

“Not to mention the eyes that flutter like doves,” I laughed. “Behind a veil. Tell me that isn’t a disturbing mental picture.”

“So,” Celsula laughed, smoothing her antennae as she did whenever she was nervous, in a compulsive gesture. “What’s your bet?” she asked me. “Bible, or not? Name your terms. Winner buys the loser kelp- chlorophyll water, all week, again.”

I smiled at her. Then I went over to my copy of the Bible, picked it up, and pointed to a passage.

“No fair,” she laughed,  taking back the papers she'd handed to me. “You cheated. Since when do you ever read *more* than the books you’re assigned, Wiln? 

“Just read it,” I smiled at her. 

*My beloved speaks and says to me:*  
 *“Arise, my love, my beautiful one,*  
  *and come away,*  
  *for behold, the winter is past;*  
  *the rain is over and gone.*  
 *The flowers appear on the earth,*  
  *the time of singing has come..."*  
 

“That’s super beautiful,” she said. "Flowers and singing birds. OK, I know I exaggerated a bit. It’s not all insane, I guess. Fine,” she sighed. “I lost the bet – but only because you cheated. You can’t read the whole thing, on your own, so I’ll get you next time.”

“Celsula,” I said, grinning at her, “Be honest with me. You love this stuff, right?”

“Yes,” she said, blushing green as a blade of fresh-mown grass. “Yes, it’s crazy, but I love it.”

“It wouldn’t be so weird, if we translated it, to our terms, right?” I said. “My beloved’s skin is pale as a leaf in the wind; it shines in the breeze like the light of the seven moons. My beloved’s eyes are dark as a well, and as deep; they hold more mysteries than all the minerals in the mines of Velchor.”

“Wiln!” she gasped. “You did not just make that up.”

“I didn’t,” I admitted. My skin was probably darker than the depths of the green sea, and my heart pounded. “I wrote it for you, a few weeks ago.”

“You – what?” she said.

“This book...has a reputation, let’s just say,” I admitted. “I did some digging in the archives about books of the Bible. I came across I don’t know how many people making fun of it in Earth’s history. So I read it, and as soon as I did, I knew you’d love it. Just like you love everything in this insane book. Which is one of the things I love best about….”

She stared at me, with hope and fear in her black eyes.

“About you,” I finally said. 

We had a joke posted on our bulletin board, above the desks where we worked. “Please assign this book a rating, per the request of the Catholic Church,” it said. All summer long, the rating had hovered between a 6.5 and a 9.5: 6.5 was what I’d rated it after I ploughed painfully through the book of Numbers; it hit 9.5 after Celsula had read the book of Esther and sang its praises for so long I suggested she write her own fanfiction about it. 

But that day, after the Song of Solomon had finally brought us together, at long last, I assigned it a 10.
