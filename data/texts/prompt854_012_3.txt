I still remember the day they passed the law. The one that allowed execution for any crime one day a year. I was in prison, and some of my fellow prisoners believed that we wouldn't be affected. They were proven wrong when then were shot for bringing restricted medicines into the prison. That was the second of January. The authorities thought that it was a fitting date, purging the world on the first working day of the calendar year. I just felt it was a sick joke. Now I've been released from prison, and need to get a job. The new year is in a week, and I can't afford to stay on the streets on that date. After all, the homeless are all "purged" for trespassing. I have a masters in physics, and yet nobody will hire me. All of this because I tried to create a working prototype of my advanced signal jammer. It was illegal, and somebody had rated me out,resulting in my incarceration. I'm still waiting for an answer from the latest round of prospective employers. This time, I've applied for jobs at fast food chains and restaurants, and I'm still not sure I'll get a job, especially at this time. After all, no employer wants to get shot due to their employees' mistakes. As I walk down the road, I get a call, and I'm told that I have a job. It is a simple job that does not make use of my potential, but the pay will be enough to put a roof over my head on the purge day. I report to the restaurant, and work hard to ensure that I'm not fired. On the purge day, my manager calls me to his office. As I step in, the last thing I hear is "Baskin Robbins always finds out." 

**This is one of my first attempts in this sub. Constructive criticism is welcome.**
