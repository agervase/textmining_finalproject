It appeared to the old man that the corn-tips had each been finely painted with gold leaf. The remnants of craftsmen in the wind, perhaps. He didn't miss things when they were gone; to him, everything that comes into existence will pass out again. He observes them all with fascination, like an array of flares on the horizon. The idea of life creating accurate, perfect things purely for its own pleasure had always made him smile, it was simple and selfish. Selfish in the way that life must be, as there isn't enough time for a finite conscience to wilfully neglect itself and watch the universe go by. Crafting something with total devotion and skill, pouring gushes of aesthetic soul into one complete object solely to curb your satisfaction. He liked that. The lines in his face ran like shallow riverbeds, and the corner of his mouth turned up like the slip of a pencil. 

Evening was playing it's Magnum Opus. Gently sweeping in over the fields like a silk thread fog. A young child walked along the jutted path through the corn towards him, holding a leaf and letting it flow in the breeze like a kite. Behind the child the sky roared purple and the land was licked by bronze spears of sunlight - colour swinging through its final movement, the last page of music flicked. Closer now, the old man could see him. He looked contented, just as a boy playing in a field does. The old man waited softly, patiently. 

"It was so warm today". The child looked up and squeezed his eyes shut.

"Yes, it was". 

The old man looked up too. His senses were a crescendo, a beautifully complex arrangement drawing harmonies together like gravity. Now felt right. He reached out a worn hand and the boy took it.

Like a conductor, slender fingers released the stem of the leaf and it danced away, as they did.
