The plane starts to shake. Normal turbulence, I hope. I've been on so many planes around the world that I'm used to it. Being a former washed up LCS player has its perks, I guess.

The flight attendants look nervous. I glance out the window, and the engine is on fire. Whatever, I can carry this plane.

People are crying now, screaming, both engines are on fire. The lights turn off and the emergency lights turn on. This may be too hard to carry. This might be too much for Imaqtpie.

All of a sudden, the overhead oxygen masks drop down. Instead of the mask I expected, I hear a small meow.

"Smallcat! What are you doing? Where are you going?"

I follow Smallcat to the back of the plane. There's chaos. People are calling their loved ones. Smallcat scratches a small box and in it I find an hourglass. Could it be? Could it really be Zhonya's Hourglass? 

I smile, this plane can't ground dive me. As we plummet towards the earth Smallcat jumps up on my shoulders. I know it's time. I close my eyes and rub the hourglass. Instantly I am turned into a gold statue.

When I wake 2.5 seconds later, there is fire. Fire everywhere. I run out of the mangled fuselage of the plane to safety. Everybody is dead. Everybody but me and Smallcat. As I walk away to safety, I laugh once again. Welcome to the big dick club, appreciate it a lot Smallcat. 

Then an explosion from the wreck. I turn around with enough time to see a piece of metal soaring at me. Not even Smallcat could save me.

Moments later I lay on the ground impaled. I'm bleeding out, I don't have a lot of time. With my last ounce of energy I grab Smallcat and whisper my last words:

"Wow that actually killed me."
