Tears rolled down her cheeks one after another as I broke the news to her.  Emma had been one of my best friends for as long as I can remember, we even had a few flings but the same thing always got in our way of being happy...I was one of her names but she was neither of mine. 

"Em.." I say as I run my hand over her shoulder and down her arm. The pain of having this conversation and watching it break her down was something I had planned for but not something I could even prepare for. "We both knew that one day it was going to come to this... she's one of my names.." Her eyes shoot towards me in a way that tightens my chest as she manages to choke a sentence between the sniffling. "You are making a mistake, you feel it and so do I but your mother can't allow that can she? How will that make her look in front of her so called friends?" She pulls her body away from the touch of my hand and backs away, her eyes glaring through me before she finally turns towards the parking lot and soon disappears into the crowd. 

It has been 2 and a half years since that night and it still crosses my mind every morning I wake up. "Honey!" a voice calls from the living room. "Can you pull yourself out of bed long enough to come help me decide on these colors?" I roll my eyes and let out a groan as I roll myself out of bed and stumble into the living room. "There you are, I was starting to think I was going to put these final touches on this wedding by myself"


This is definitely my first Writing Prompt..figured I'd give it a try!
