My alarm goes off at 5:45 am and I sit up groggily, rubbing my eyes and trying to ignore the slight bit of nausea from last night's booze. I slowly rise up out of bed and shuffle towards the kitchen, I can't hardly see because it's so dark and I stub my toe on the corner of the wall. 

"Fuck!" I yell out with pain. My girlfriend somehow does not wake up and I'm bewildered that somebody can sleep through such audibly loud cursing at 5:46 in the morning. 

After turning on the kitchen lights, I pour a glass of cold water and drink it down quickly, followed by making some coffee and wishing I was still asleep, or dead or something other than awake. I then return to the bathroom and brush my teeth in a half-assed way, and take a very quick cold shower to clean off the stale sweat I've somehow accumulated throughout my body. I must sweat a lot when I sleep. Weird.

I dry off after my shower, blow dry my hair, because I have long hair even though I'm a guy. It doesn't really matter, does it? Probably not. I walk with the towel wrapped around my waist like a toga to the kitchen and pour a cup of hot coffee, which is arguably the only good part about getting up this early because I hate waking up this fucking early. An hour's time passes, by now I've gotten dressed and made a bit of breakfast, and go wake up  my girlfriend before going out into the cold ass winter morning to start my truck and let it warm up for a bit. These Kentucky winter mornings suck almost as bad as waking up at 5:45 in the damn morning. 

I am a working class citizen and this is my usual morning, unless I wake up late, then this process is a lot more rushed and frantic.

EDIT: few little grammatical errors
