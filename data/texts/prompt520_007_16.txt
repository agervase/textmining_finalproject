**-Henry**

It didn’t take long for the pain to set in.  Henry had been silently going through his biology homework when he felt a flash.  He didn’t quite see the flash.  He felt it.

Now he wasn’t certain what he was seeing.  He had been near his window at his home.  He would drift mindlessly while reading over his work and watch the trees.  The same trees he had grown with during his childhood, making sure to get one last glimpse of the sunset as he sat in its nooks and crannies.

The light that shone down on him now was a faint yellow, and he sensed that it was night.  The room felt quiet, which made the sudden pain in his abdomen seem so frightful.  

He wondered about what he had eaten.  It wasn’t all that different from his normal diet, but somehow he’d felt like his stomach wasn’t his own.  

He knew that what he felt was his pain, but the pain didn’t come from within his own body.  It didn’t feel like his pain.

The light above flickered and he immediately noticed he hadn’t been able to look elsewhere.  It started to frighten Henry.  

He couldn’t take his eyes off the light and he had no idea why.  Was it something he ate?

**-Glen**

Glen wasn’t always the most giving person.  He knew this now as he’d known after his wife Jessica left him.  He didn’t blame her.  

Glen wasn’t always the person who had the right thing to say.  Glen simply went on most of his life not ever knowing what to say.

That’s why it made dying so difficult.  His entire life was spent being apathetic to everyone he touched, met or made acquaintance with.  

Being lonely all this time didn’t allow Glen to think about his diet either.  There was no one around to pester Glen about his weight.  Glen never heard anyone tell him to limit the amount of fatty foods he consumed.

He wasn’t much of anything, but if he was good at something, it was being good at being a good person.  

He had passions, he simply refused to share those passions with others.  He had ambition and charisma, and he had odd ways of showing it.  

He might not have given much to anyone else, but he’d been content with himself enough.  It was good being Glen most days, because Glen was good to him.

That was all great until he received his phone call from the doctor’s office.  It hadn’t taken long to ring up his house after his test, and he had postponed answering for weeks.

One day Glen decided that he'd answer their call, but the calls stopped coming.

Glen hadn't loved anyone else in his life after his marriage.  He had wanted to, but the nearest he got to dating was exchanging smiles with Mary, the pretty 40 something divorcee.  She never smiled at anyone else like that, Glen thought, but even Mary wasn't here right now.

Glen was alone.  Glen felt despair.

He *felt* a flash..

Glen screamed.

This surprised him, and sent him reeling backwards.  He screamed, yet somehow he had not heard his own voice.  It came from his mouth, but that wasn’t his voice.  

It was like someone had taken a tube of some miraculous medicine and doused his throat.  He felt good.  He could breathe.  He didn’t taste the acrid fumes that came from his innards, and he could actually breathe through his nose.

The bed from which he screamed on, and subsequently fell off, was not his.  He had been lying in his hospital room, alone.  Now he was staring from the floor, looking at the bed with its pattern of blues and yellows which adorned the sheets covering it.

He just sat there.  He had been bedridden for so many months that it seemed a nearly insurmountable feat to use his arms, prop them against the floor and lift his body.  He made a small squeak, laughing at the idea.  His left and right hands came down on the floor in unison.  He felt their strength.

Looking at his arms, they were the strong arms of a young male.  He pressed himself up and immediately took to the room.  He could look around without strain.  He hadn’t known that feeling in a very long time.

Glen looked down at the bed and noticed the biology book.  It was pried open, some scrambled paperwork beside it.  Notes, numbers and web addresses seemingly at random covering footnotes.  some photos could be seen lying underneath.

He hadn’t been born a fool, but Glen knew he was somehow being tricked.  His current situation was simply impossible.  He was hallucinating.  He started to feel a little dizzy, slowly gasping at the realization of what was happening.

Noticing the jeans sitting on the seat of the chair next to the bed, Glen grabbed them and looked for a wallet.  Sitting in the front pocket was a small key.  

As he took the key from the pocket, a wallet fell from the pants and hit the carpeted floor.  Glen grabbed for it when he noticed a small, plain looking, metal box.  It had been left open, and a small keyhole could be seen on what looked like a metal door.  

He pulled out the safe, which was surprisingly light, and looked inside.

**-Henry**

After several minutes, Henry decided to try and scream for help.  Nothing happened.  

All he could feel now, aside from the pain in his abdomen, was a new sharp pain in his chest.  

It was as if someone had been pressing underneath his flesh, groping for his heart.  He winced and tried to cry.  Nothing happened.

His mind was spinning and he started to ponder.  He had done everything like he always had when coming home from private school.  It always took him a couple weeks to set it up, but Henry always had it his way.  

The girls he found weren’t normally the prettiest, but Henry preferred them ugly.  He also helped them stay ugly.

Henry knew he himself was beautiful, it was one of the things most of his friends and family told him.  Henry was an exemplary student, understood and spoke in 3 languages, and happened to be in top physical shape for his age.  He considered himself an alpha, and did not believe himself wrong.

He was physically fit, a strong body handed down to him through generations of fatherly good genes.  Henry believes it was his mother who gave him his intelligence and wit.  She had a certain gift, his mother.

His willpower was also something he didn’t take for granted.

It always frightened the girls at first, how overcoming he could be.  How willful a real man could be.  

An ugly should be so welcoming of someone of his stature, even the ugly who can't see him for what he was.  

All of this didn't matter to Henry, because it was made clear that Henry would be the last person they see.  Henry had so much darkness and his own ugliness to show his girls.  

But now..now Henry was afraid.  Melissa had been dead in his basement for 2 days already.  It hadn't been time yet.   

He had some work to finish for school, so it was OK to stop for a bit.  He was spent.

His biology homework was a  productive way of working through his emotions.  It helped clear his thoughts.

It was then that Henry realized something else.  He had been thinking of an ugly girl.  He had been thinking of Melissa.  

So what the hell was wrong?  Normally he could feel the adrenaline, the surge of blood through his veins.  But not now...now he just felt pain.  And loneliness.

A scream.

More of them now.

Henry was scared.

**-Glen**

Glen vomited in the trash can near the door.  He missed but that didn’t concern him much.  He realized then that he really needed to leave this room.  

Whatever was happening, whoever he was then or now, he had to leave this behind him.  Glen understood then that he could not be found here, in this room, looking like..looking like someone else.

He hadn’t looked in a mirror yet, but he’s not so lost and gone to know he isn’t the face in the pictures from the metal box..

Those pictures with the girls.  Those poor girls.  That wasn't Glen with the girls.

Glen looked around and found a jacket to wear, he grabbed the wallet from the floor.

He reached for the door, and turned to look back.

The bed.  A name was inscribed in a scrolling font, on the bed’s wooden frame: *Henry D.*

Someone had also scratched different words along the wood.  They were names, and dates.  

*Terri 07-02-85*

*Sue 07-03-93*

*Patricia 07-02-99*

He counted another 5 haphazardly scribbled names, each having their own unique date. Each one seemed to be etched by a different hand.

The most recent looking name and date that had been etched, seemed to be missing its year.  *Melissa 07-03-*

He quickly backed up, slightly catching the bed sheet.  His eyes glanced a picture on the bed.

It was a girl, young looking, dark black hair.  She looked scared and alone.  He couldn't see the name written in black marker on the photo, and he didn't want to find out.

Glen turned once more and walked out the bedroom door.  The house was quiet.  He could hear some faint sounds coming from outside.  It might have belonged to someone screaming, but he thought he heard a siren as well.

He found his way downstairs and headed for the kitchen.  He realized then that he was famished.  His new body felt like it had been fasting.  Henry looked through all the cupboards, the fridge and a small pantry he found set into the wall.

There was no food in the house.

"...", Henry heard a noise.  It was faint at first.

"Hello?..", a voice speaks softly, seemingly coming from the board beneath him.

“Hello?  Hello?  Who’s there?", the voice moving away.  It moved toward the front hallway leading out of the kitchen, when Glen saw the door.

"I don’t know what I am doing in here.  I’m hurt.  Please.  Call an ambulance...oh God.  What is this?  Where am I?  Hello?", the voice was desperate.

Glen sat there, staring at the door.  The voice carrying from the cellar became a little clearer.  Glen stood up and forced his legs to move forward.

He approached the door and looked at the doorknob.  It was locked.  The house was once again quiet, and he felt the doorknob in his hand quiver slightly.

"Hello? If you can hear me, please..please help me.  My name..my name is...Jessica.  Hello?"
