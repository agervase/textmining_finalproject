Assassin, interesting.

I'm more a Ranger with a beast master sub role myself, but I think I can destroy Jake with my eyes closed.

So let's get down to business. I'll get my trusty partner of crime. Numerous hours of endless DnD story lines and side quests, how could I leave my sacred buddy?

Jake, the Paladin (such a trash class). Exclaimed, "I rolled a max 20, so Karen you have to be my slave for the next 20 turns and 5 more turns when I roll a 5 or more!"

&#x200B;

"Jake what the fuck. Stop with these ridiculous spells. We are in middle of fighting goblins."

&#x200B;

Karen looks at the DM, John, but he skims a page in the DnD rule book and shook his head. "Sorry Karen, it says right here Vol XIV Ch. 58 sub article 3&a, that Paladins can have secret spells if they're level 18."

&#x200B;

Karen does a frustrated sigh, then responds, "Fine. Jake heal me. I'm low on health."

&#x200B;

"Sorry can't do. Gotta save my spell slots so I can tell you what to do on my next turn."

&#x200B;

A little bit interested of what Jake is going to do with Karen's half fox/half dinosaur character, I had to remind myself to step in before I won't be able to stop him. I roll a 19, so I get to summon my best pet. "Rex, steal all of Jake's equipment and render him useless with your morning screams!"

&#x200B;

Rex is my pet chicken. He use to be weak and had to be necromancied every 5 turns, but now he is a force to be reckon with. Rex learned strange abilities due to my infatuation of trying to find the best build for him. Years of research and experience went into growing him to be the ultimate farm fighting machine.

&#x200B;

Jake looks at me for a second and turns straight to John. "JOHN YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. HE IS A DROP IN. WITH A PET CHICKEN THAT HAS INSANE ABILITIES."

&#x200B;

John turns the pages in the rule book and points it for everyone to see that it is possible for characters to have insanely powered pets if you follow the strict guidelines and prove it with the App.

&#x200B;

I tell the Paladin, "Sorry Jake, you look like a fun target." So I ordered Rex to put John in a spell that he can't speak if he doesn't say "Puk Puk Pukaaak" in between every few words.

&#x200B;

Jake tries to refute, but the DM refuses to hear anything from him because rules are rules.
