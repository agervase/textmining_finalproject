I was tipped off to the location of an abandoned school house near the edge of the city. The kid who gave up the information wasn't exactly cooperative, at first, but a few days off of pixie dust had him itching so bad that he gladly told me what I wanted to know for just a little sprinkle. 

Addictive stuff. Like nothing the guys at the lab have ever seen, and they've been no fucking help since this all started. A case like this takes real cop work, dirty work, and that's the kind I prefer to do alone. I sprinkled a bit of the stuff on my head after three weeks of dead ends, evidence is loaded with this shit, and what's more, it doesn't weigh anything, *literally nothing*, so they have no way of accurately keeping track of it anyway -it won't be missed. 

Sometimes you gotta think like a crook to catch one, and that was my philosophy here; but, to my surprise, the pixie dust had no effect on me. I practically shoved my head in the damn bag; *nothing*, but these kids are flying high like fairies off this shit. Maybe it only affects the youth? What kind of animal develops a drug that only works on kids?

It's raining cats and dogs outside, but that's to my advantage. The constant patter of rain hitting the old metal roofs suppresses the sound of my engine as I roll up to the old school. I keep my lights off as I pull off the side of the road and park the Jolly Roger behind some natural cover. She's seen better days, and if I get any closer her rumbling will surely tick me off, but I know she's here and reliable if this goes south. 

I make my way towards the schoolhouse, staying close to the tree line, and I can make out lights coming from inside. Nothing electrical, as far as I can tell, definitely fire. There's a few kids hanging out under an awning near the flag pole at the front of the school, the glow of a couple cigarettes illuminates them enough for me to see their faces, and their weapons. *Knives.* One kid is theatrically flourishing a butterfly knife while the others coo excitedly; *moron*, easy way to lose a hand. One of them knocks a beer bottle off the old table, and I use this as an opportunity to move quickly towards the rear of the building. 

The rain is keeping up, and there's quite a bit of noise coming from inside, so I'm not too worried about keeping quiet now. The old building is tagged up with red, yellow, and orange spray paint. Various symbols and words are plastered around, but one thing is repeated often: *LB*.

Looks like there's a stairwell around the side of what looks like a gymnasium, possibly rafter access, I won't get a better opportunity to do some surveillance. I suppose I could call this in, but then what? Have this place raided, and all these strung out kids killed in a firefight? Not that I think they'd send em anyways, that pussy Smee has been telling everyone to steer clear of this since the beginning, and I suspect he knows something we don't. 

I'm up the stairwell now, and as suspected, there's easy access into the gymnasium from here. The windows are fogged up, but I can make out a ton of movement inside by the low light. I open one enough for me to slide in, and close it behind me. 

It's a damn circus down there. The place is packed with kids, and they're all high off their asses. There's a few massive fires going at both ends of the court, and smaller flames are scattered about elsewhere. A few kids are perched up on the basketball hoops, dumping pixie dust down on half naked children dancing around in ecstasy, they're smashing bottles, fighting, and doing things to one another that are well beyond their immaturity. However, nothing compares to what's going on at half-court: A large circle of kids, surrounding what looks like a duel. 

Two older boys are engaged in frantic swordplay, dancing about with wondrous flair as they strike and parry. There are dueling chants amongst the crowd as well, each rising and falling with the swing of blades. 

***RUFIO, RUFIO, RUFIOOOOOOO!***

***PAN'S THE MAN, PAN, PAN, PAN!***

That's him! The one in the tight green pants, *Peter Pan*. I saw that name repeated countless times on the reports I'd snaked. This is who everyone is looking for, and he's just a kid himself. But the way he moves, the way he fights, I've never seen a kid do these things. 

There's no way I can break this up on my own, even with the gun, and I'm definitely not taking those little bastards in a sword fight. I make my way back to the window and try to push it open. It won't budge. I give it a good shove, but the damn thing flies open as the wind catches it and it shatters. 

All the noise below me ceases, and I sit as still as possible in the dark of the rafters. 

"Lost Boy?!" 

I don't say a word, and just as I'm about to make my way back out of the broken window, a voice creeps up from behind me in thin air. 

"Hmmm, I don't remember inviting any grown ups to the party? None I didn't want to kill, anyways."

I whirl around with my gun drawn, and right there before me, literally floating, is the boy in green: *Peter Pan*. 

I'm stunned, how the fuck is he doing that? 

His leg rises up in a flash, and my gun is soaring through the air before I have time to think. "Only a grown up would use a coward's weapon like that!" 

The kid grabs me by the throat, and suddenly we're flying through the air and quickly descending towards the middle of the dueling circle. The bastards all have their weaponry held high in the air, and its all glistening in the fire light. Pan lands on his feet while somehow still holding me up off the ground by my neck; *damn he's strong!*. The mass of kids ring out. 

***BANGARANG!***

"What do you think, Rufio? Pirate?" Pan smiles at me as he inquires to his associate, who lurks out from behind me and settles next to him. 

His eyes and skin are dark, and his hair is wild and red. "All grown ups are pirates!" He's walking around the edge of the circle, sword held high, "And what, *Lost Boys*, do we do to pirates?!"

***KILL THE PIRATE!***

Pan releases me and I plop down on the hardwood. I'm up like lightning, still some fight in me, and I throw a punch right at his smug face. Of course, he ducks it, and my momentum has me back on the floor with dozens of blades trained on me. 

"Well well!" Pan is excited now. "This one's actually got some fight in him, hasn't he?!"

The kids erupt in a sound which I can only describe as a rooster's crow. 

"I can respect that, old man. So, I'll tell you what: We're gonna let you go!" 

Cries of disappointment ring out all around, and I can hear them making fart noises in disapproval. 

"Now now! That's not to say he won't be paying his price. We need to give him something to remember us by, so if he ever comes back, he'll hopefully come prepared to offer us a *real* fight!"

The kids crow like roosters again, and Pan grabs me and spins me around. He's holding both of my hands down onto the floor, and I can only imagine what they're about to do to me. 

"Take his hand, Rufio, our prize, and his incentive to come back and reclaim it!" 

Rufio steps out in front of me, and he's now wielding a dull looking axe. He lines it up with my right hand, preparing to strike, but Pan interrupts.

"No! *The left hand.* That's the one he was holding his piece with."

***BANGARANG!***

That little fucker. If they let me go then they're making a mistake, because I swear this won't be the last time they see Captain James Hook.
