She looked at me as if I'd just grown a pair of horns, an odd mix of fascination and horror. For a moment, I doubted my own eyes, wondering if they had somehow read my license incorrectly. Then I thought, no, that's not possible. I know for a fact that I would have noticed an anomaly such as that. The woman stuttered a little as she said "H-Hold on a s-second, sir," while picking up the phone. Briefly I heard the dial tone and then key tones as she punched in some numbers. That's when I realized that I could hear the dial tone and key tones. Why could I hear them? It should be loud enough in here so that.....  
&nbsp;  
I turned around, unnerved by the fact that I heard nothing but the woman's voice. I felt, as much as saw, the eyes of every single person in the terminal looking directly at me, with more behind them on the concourse. Not a single person made a sound, much less a movement, but their eyes locked onto my being felt as if a thousand rifles were pointed at me, ready to open fire at the slightest provocation. Everything seemed to go slightly blurry for a second or two, then cleared up as I blinked. "This isn't normal," I thought, "this isn't RIGHT." Is this what it feels like to be looking into the jaws of death? What am I doing that's so WRONG here, and why is it that every time I want to go somewhere, this kind of glitch happens?  
&nbsp;  
Frightened and not understanding why, I turned back around as the woman hung up. She looked up at me, then quickly looked away, then finally down to her computer. Fidgeting with the keyboard and mouse while trying to appear calm, that's what I saw. The fact that she was nervous only served to make me even more nervous in turn. I could feel every pair of eyes around me, each pair burning holes into my body, and another, more ominous feeling deep in my gut. As if an alarm went off inside me, I suddenly felt an urgent need to run, to escape this place. Turning around again, perhaps I was imagining it, but the gazes felt more menacing than before. Where could I run though, with so many people behind me, and virtually nowhere to go in front of me?  
&nbsp;  
Looking back to the ticket counter, I watched two men in uniform walk up to the woman. She whispered something to them and then glanced at me. The two uniforms looked me up and down, then simultaneously their right hands dropped to their sides as they circled around the counter towards me. I took an anxious step backward due to their threatening posture, and they stopped, the uniform in the lead holding his left hand up on a "stop" gesture as the trailing uniform moved a couple of steps to his lead's right. "Sir, this is not a big deal, we just need to ask you a few questions. Would you please come with us?" Now clearly seeing that their right hands were resting on the handles of their pistols, I asked, "If this is no big deal, then why are your hands on your guns and ready to draw down on me?  
&nbsp;  
Things went slightly blurry again, and I rubbed my eyes, thinking my sweat had run into them. Then for just the briefest fraction of a second, I saw what I thought was not blurriness, but pixelization of the two uniformed men, as if I were looking at them on a monitor with low resolution. Before I could ponder this, the lead uniform spoke again. "Sir, please come with us. We assure you that nothing is wrong, Please do not make a scene." Hands still poised and ready to draw, I detected a slight movement from the second uniform. My eyes swiftly locked onto that movement, and identified it as a shaky hand, hovering over his gun. "Bad sign," I thought, there's no way this isn't going to get nasty if he's losing his courage and on the verge of a freakout. I've only got two choices here, run and try to survive, or surrender and possibly have the plug pulled on my own existence. No, I can't let them stop me. Not again.  
&nbsp;  
The look on my face must have changed enough to tip them off, I realized as I saw their hands move to unholster their sidearms. I didn't know what I would do or where I would go, I only knew I had to go NOW. Using the fact that I was standing perpendicular to them, with my head turned, I had just enough of an advantage to act. My left side being closer to them, I underhand-tossed my briefcase in an arc towards them, then swung my suitcase around like a heavyweight fighter throwing a punch, slinging it sidearm directly at them. I charged towards them as soon as I could after the suitcase left my hand, and watched as lead uniform unsuccessfully tried to parry the frisbeed suitcase, his pistol flying out of his hands and him stumbling backwards as he lost his balance. Uniform two had been distracted by the underhand briefcase, and realized his mistake just in time to see my fist halfway between my body and his face. He thudded to the floor, head bouncing hard and his gun clattering across the floor a few steps away.  
&nbsp;  
Scrambling for the gun, I quickly snatched it up and spun, looking for the other uniform. There he was, on his feet and reaching for his gun. Firing a wild shot in his direction, I yelled "DON'T TOUCH IT!" as I ran towards him. He recoiled briefly at the sound of the shot and looked back at me, looked back at the gun, then back to me again. I pointed my pistol at him and said "Don't do it, I don't want to kill you, I just want to leave." He looked at the gun again, and once more back at me, before seeming to blur/pixelate slightly as his body began to move. I yelled "STOP!" and, when he moved toward the gun, I pulled the trigger.....

Sorry people, out of time at the moment, but I'll write a conclusion tonight or tomorrow!
