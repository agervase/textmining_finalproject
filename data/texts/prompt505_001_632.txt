Every good competition has rules. This one was simple: each competitor took one shot a minute. The loser was the first to black out. I chose the location and he, as the challenger, chose the drink. Being the Norse god of alcohol I of course picked my own great hall. He arrived just after midnight exactly a week after the challenge was issued carrying a large bottle of the finest tequila to ever come out of Tijuana, Mexico. I almost felt pity for the man; never before had I been vested in such a competition, yet he chose to challenge me. In silence, we sat across from each other at the single table I’d had prepared earlier that day. As he uncapped the bottle I conjured up two shot glasses clinking together as they popped into existence. He poured, and we drank. When the bottle was a quarter empty I asked him, “How do you feel?” He simply looked at me and poured two more shots. Again and again the cycle repeated. 10, 20, 30, on and on, but even as I began to feel the effects the Machine did not slow. As the shots were poured my respect for this man grew, for no one had ever lasted this long against me. Not even the other gods could beat me in a competition of drinking. When the bottle emptied another was created, and so it went until from the depths of the mans belly came forth a belch to shake the very foundations of the hall. My immaturity got the best of me, and I began to laugh as tears of pure joy welled up in my eyes. My spouts of laughter turned into gasps for air as my head began to spin, and it all hit me at once. I fell from my chair feeling the worst vertigo since I’d drank all the vodka in Russia a couple thousand years ago. As my head hit the floor and my vision began to fade I saw the machine stand. The last thing I heard was the his voice drifting into my ears as he stood left: “Bite my shiny metal ass.”
