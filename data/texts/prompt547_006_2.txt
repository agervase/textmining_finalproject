John dropped his eggs and felt something hit his head.  Was that... a clod of dirt?  He quickly realized other things were falling from the sky too.  Unfortunately the sky was filled to the brim with floating islands and cities that had no sensible reason to be there, and apparently the godly powers that be (he would need to have an existential crisis later)  weren't keen on making sure that gravity was "turned off" for the new landmasses now tumbling down to earth.  He moved as quickly as he could back to his car but at that very moment an odd looking man dressed as David Bowie from the 80s slammed into his vehicle in a way that ensured he was not coming back, and shortly after that a vwbus landed on his house.  Unfortunately the Chicago sized landmass looked like its edge was right above him so that while the whole thing was falling he was getting all the runnoff as if it tilted hitting an iceberg.  

John noticed that a kid on a bike was trying to get to the outer limit, so he did the only thing his irrational, crazed mind could think of at the moment.  He grabbed a piece of wood that had fallen from the sky and smacked the kid off the bike.  It wasn't that hard to fight off the kid and this was possibly-probably a life or death situation, and the limitless potential of youth wasn't much when compared to a man who is the biggest pineapple importer of the southeast.

"Fuck you old ma-".  The kid was cut off by what might have been a penny steaking through his helmet, skull, then out his jaw and finally onto the ground.  At least he didn't have to live to see the bleak hell that is 21st century adulthood.  Fortunately the bike was undamaged, and John clambered on it with all the grace of a trout on land trying to eat a coconut.  But John didn't have time to worry about that.  Not when... the sky was falling
