(This is my first post. I wrote it on my phone so of course please excuse the poor format.)

At last, I watched the insect start to twitch, then it flipped over to its legs again. It started to walk around. It was alive.

I jumped up in joy. I shouted, "Eureka!" I was going to be a millionaire. Best of all, I had cheated death; I had cheated the devil.

I felt a presence next to me and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the devil himself. I smirked a bit; the last time I had seen him was when we had made the deal. I supposed he was here because I had broken it.

"You broke the deal," he said shortly.

I turned to face him, placing a hand on the counter and shifting my weight to lean on it. I accidentally crushed the insect, but as I rose my hand curiously, it was already scuttling around.

"I did no such thing," I replied. "The deal was simple: unlimited funding for my research in exchange for eternity in hell with you. I'm just using my research money."

"I'm not stupid, I know what you're doing!" the devil shouted, watching the insect crawl around on the counter. 

"Why didn't you try to stop me, then?" I asked. "If you knew what I was researching, you could've stopped me."

The devil hesitated. I had defeated him once again. "This isn't fair!" he eventually cried. "We made a deal. You can't do this!"

"Sorry," I shrugged, not sorry at all. "Maybe you'll get me when I die for an eternity in hell..." I trailed off, hoping he would take the bone.

"But you won't die," he said shortly. "This is stupid."

"Sorry," I said again. "Thanks for the money, though, I really appreciate that. I'm gonna be a millionaire with this serum!"

The devil scowled, eyeing the insect once more. I smirked in triumph. I had successfully cheated the devil.
