You say to me why should you save me after you faze me with your stun gun 

I don't want none, but listen son, cause I'm about to school you 

with what I knew would one day come to free me, it's easy, the history of these cities 

See, we evolved from nothing to what you see here

Ugly as sin chimps without any hair 

But before you start judging, I should warn you of what we can do 

Yeah we kill our own planet with atomic bombs, and we'll fuck your shit up too
 
The pharaohs smitted those that got in their way

Roman legions conquered the past legends that had lost all their sway 

Martin Luder may have had a hard time shitting 

But he didn't have trouble calling upon his god and lifting 

His people towards what he deemed salvation, setting up years of death and destruction 

For anyone not like him, it was best decided that he fight them, he himself we can lose, don't forget what he said about the jews 

As hitler sure didn't, 60 million dead, over some fucked up Austrian boy who grew up fucked in the head 

Ended the war just so that we can go and start another, Ava Marie we're in Korea to keep the peace, as a piece of the meat of my friend in the next seat gets blown away with an A-K 

Even at home here in the US of A, we were never united, we never could say that we fought together as one people alone, as just a few years back some of these very people were owned 

And on May 13th, 85, we dropped bombs on our own city and the Africans didn't survive, but the city will tell you it was for their own good, people can be replaced as quick as the brick and wood which still sits singed in the city today and we'd bomb it the same if they acted this way, so don't come to my planet in your spacesuit trying to act tough, cause we're the most violent fuckers in this system and we'll never get enough. 

*drops mic as the aliens decide that maybe Earth is not the best place to colonize*
