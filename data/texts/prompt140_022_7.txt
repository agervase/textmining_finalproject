*Oh my what little creature has eluded my grip for so long?*

Death crouches down beneath the hardwood desk. Dust rhinos and forgotten food crumbs litter the underside.

*ick I do need to get in here and clean one of these days*. Makes a mental note for tomorrow.

Reaching under he ponders whom was so lucky as to be left alone? Was it that Romanian king he's heard so much about? Vlad something?Could it have been that Jesus fellow? *nope.* he said to himself. *I remember him very well.*  straining just enough to finally get a boney tip on the case of the hourglass.

*GOTYA! HA! eluded me for only so long. Now who are you?*

Turning it slowly to reveal sand shifting ever so much to his movement. looking for that piece of parchment thats affixed to every glass.

*Hmmm not where you normally are.*

&#x200B;

He turns on a lamp nearby, thinking to himself openly mouthing his frustration on just how he will have to explain this anomaly to the other spirits.

*AHA!* he exclaims as he finds the remainder of the parchment, only half left behind from ages of filth rubbing it off.

*S.A.N.T.A. Santa, OH Mr. Santa Claus... huh.. I wonder what he's been up to this whole time?*

Death, relieved he can at least identify this hourglasses owner, he decides to search his quarry in the Deathernet. Just to see if maybe this Mr. Claus kept a low profile, or somehow accidently got buried. The usual threats he used to give any souls who may try to overstay their welcome.

*Ah here he.... is.... hmmm. Has a whole Holiday celebrated with him included. Yada yada toys and... elves? dwarves? hmph.*

Under his breath he mutters more words, audibly expressing his wonder that this soul, out of zillions that cross his path and usually pray for more time, did the most noble of jobs for very little recognition.

*Well, I guess I should probably go and grab Mr. Claus.* with a sigh. *After all it was his time hundreds of years ago.*

Death gets up, fixes his robes and pats it free of dust. Grabs the still dusty glass. Looks at it. Observes it.

Death smiles as he places it back on the ground near his desk. Give the hourglass a quick nudge and loses it once more to the deep under desk jungle.

*Not Today. Not. Today.*
