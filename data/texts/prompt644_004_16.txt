This time, I would be ready. No matter from where, no matter from who, no matter what was going to take me down today?

I swore it wouldn't. Then again, I swore that yesterday. And last month. Last year. For three miserable years.

I even got jumped in bed when I was sick as a dog with the flu and rolled off on the carpet by a girl in a nurse outfit. At least she held my hair out of the barf wastebasket, but still. Every. Damn. Day. Like ninjas.

*Ping.*

My vertical leap would put NBA stars to shame, and my feet came down on the log that had tried to tackle me toda- 

Wat. Log? The wood that had been a shortish man gave no answer.

*Ping!*

I found myself running up a wall to hang off the bottom of a fireplace as his twin tried again.

*PING!*

No, another fucking two-legs-by-four manwannabe, because I dropped to the street as he tried to tackle me and landed with both feet on the rounded woodchuckable. Gracefully. It barely moved.

*PIIING!*

One leg shot out like a spear, and caught Log Guy in the gut. It really was like kicking a log. Because it was a log.

An inane song of "It's better than bad, it's good!" earwormed me to the clunks of it sliding down some stairs to the street. And just like that, he was there again. No pings.

As he came to me, one leg raised on my wooden roller, I booped his nose. His eyes crossed at the touch. And he didn't log out.

Clapping. A tall figure with a voice so androgynous Bowie would cry.

"The novice has awakened. Harvest the sapling.".

The darts that sent me to darkness were my beginning as a master of Shadow, the Clan of a Thousand Forests. As I had novices practicing their disguises and takedowns on a seed like me, so you have been. Until you finally woke up and dodged. And I, in turn harvested you. Welcome, sapling. Grow strong, and I will guide you to grow straight.
