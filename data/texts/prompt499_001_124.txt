Day 32278, Trial of Mr. Borer Before His Holiness. Proceeding Number: MMMCMXXXVMMMCDLXXXIV. Plateau of Judgement

* * *

GOD: Thank you prosecution, for the excessive and very detailed list of accusations against Mr. Borer. We had nothing else to do and had eternity to listen to them. Will the defense proceed? Mr. Borer, what say you?

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: We will proceed gladly, Your honor.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: Mr. Borer, you are perhaps aware that you are the only mortal man who can expound to us the true purposes of your actions?

MR. LANCEL BORER: I am perfectly aware of that.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: You, from the very beginning, together with those who were associated with you, intended to harm and later murder innocents?

MR. LANCEL BORER: That was, as far as I am concerned, my firm intention.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: And, upon coming to knowledge that law enforcement of your county was inadequate, you immediately started serial killings?

MR. LANCEL BORER: I found it to be no longer necessary to make due with harming people or one murder every year. Also I should like to emphasize the fact that I was moreover the best serial killer of my time period. But you are correct when you say that the law enforcement was...inadequate.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: You established a cult, under your strict authority, which you have described as a *death cult* looking only for the absolute innocents; is that correct?

MR. LANCEL BORER: In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I should like once more to explain the idea briefly. The cult was formed to purge only the innocents. We didn't look at you if you received even a parking ticket. I however, did not discriminate.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: In other words, you believed in innocence of the soul in your community project, is that correct.

MR. LANCEL BORER: Quite right. 

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: Also you say *purged* out of humility for your kind actions but you only selected the innocents because you could not bear for them to live in a harsh, doomed world.

MR. LANCEL BORER: ...Of course.

GOD: Mr. Lovegood, a mortal has no right to end a life even if they see their situations as dire.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: Certainly your honor, however, the intentions were out of pure love and kindness. Just like many great leaders of our past who did so in your name. Is the planet not doomed, is the end not upon humanity? None have a bright future to look up to.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: He has selectively chosen and helped many poor souls with a dark future to your side but he felt no joy doing these. Only his duty to you. Additionally, he has recruited many to do this grim but beautiful task. Almost like a big family I would say.

GOD: Was this your intention Mr. Borer.

MR. LANCEL BORER: ...Exactly as Mr. Lovegood stated.

GOD: Explain your *private endeavours* then, Mr. Borer.

MR. LANCEL BORER: ...

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: Gladly. You see, these were times where he experimented on how best to spread the love and kindness he did as the family I described previously. Exactly like a scientist, he endeavoured with such humility to find the proper tools and methods not even speaking about them to anyone. And like scientists, trials were not always a success and there were some unfortunate mistakes made, which he is extremely sad about even to this day, Is that not so Mr. Borer.

MR. LANCEL BORER: ...Yes.

GOD: Are you done Mr. Lovegood?

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: Not even remotely. My client is practically a saint and I would like to exonerate my client from any wrongful accusations he may face.

GOD: Thank you but this will be enough Mr. Lovegood.

MR. JUSTICE LOVEGOOD: But your honor...

GOD: ***SILENCE!*** Mr Borer, your actions in life were atrocious. You deserve eternity of torment. Yet you did indeed feel no joy from your actions. Due to your undiscovered psychopathic tendencies being only partially yours to blame and the minuscule chance that Mr. Lovegoods' points are to be true I hereby sentence you to 656 years of Hell. 1 Earth year for every soul you or your *family* took, half a year for those you tormented. Upon end of your sentence, you will be allowed in to heaven. ***DISMISSED***
