One mage, in a rage, at the orphanage. Soldiers hanging back, tongues held in check, no one’s fool enough to stick out their necks. Better ways to find, the child on his mind, than to plow ahead in ways so unrefined, but to reason he was quite disinclined.

*Reveal yourselves, step up before me*  
*Let me ponder your magical ability*  
*I search for the one who claims his power*  
*Confess, confess, or my mood will sour*  

The mage dismisses the girl who’s clearly mute, and the sickly twins with magic dilute, and the boy with the fatal stutter, in whose mouth the protests clutter. These aren’t the ones who cause him worry, and it is now that the soldiers scurry, for the evilness of his magic has begun to creep, twisting in tendrils of darkness so deep.

*Do you really think you can hide?*  
*Would I leave with my quest denied?*  
*Better you quickly demonstrate*  
*Your willingness to wholly cooperate*  

Tis’ too late to stem his anger, as his wrath multiplies like cancer, round the children like an unsated hunger, an unseen unquelled lyrical strangler. The orphanage trembles with pain, bursting with forbidden arcane, and it is then that with disdain, the stutterer shakes off the last of his restrain.

*Di-di-di-did you come looking for a fight*  
*With no invite, on-only spite, spreading blight like a parasite*  
*Why’s you got to be channelling your hate*  
*Like an irate, lightweight, reprobate*  
*No-no-no one cares*  
*About your spells, your magic, your conjured prayers*  
*Abusin’ your position, like it’s your permission*  
*To conduct your own damned inquisition*  
*Final warning, heed it close*  
*Leave now or your rhymes I will decompose*  

One mage, in a cage, completely upstaged. Soldiers running, no more cunning, leaving him with nothing. Child with eyes afire, demands made of barbed wire, nowhere can the mage retire, to avoid the magical crossfire. Mage goes down, in disbelief he drowns…

… and the child slips out to town.
