3pm. Two more hours in the shift. Almost done, just two more hours sitting in the office making sure the customers didn't hurt themselves. People watching, day in, day out.
Some matches were good, you could pick the army brats from the security, the street brawlers from the keyboard warriors, others were just straight out carnage and bansai. 

This match was different. The dozen or so on either team were mostly composed of young men in their 20's or 30's. There were no keyboard warriors here, there were flanking maneuvers, enfilade fire and diversions: this was much more *organised* than normal, and it was then I realized that there were 13 on each team. 

They'd paid for 30 minutes but being so transfixed on the engament unfolding I let it run long and hurridly hit the buzzer and called time at the 37 or 38 minute mark.
In unison numbers 13 on each side extracted themselves. One was tall, at least 6'6" and once upon a time a strapping young lad with a shock of blonde hair. The other was built like a small tank, with a moustache that could cause wind shear. The rest of the teams funneled around the pair as they walked to meet in the centre of the now war-torn field, congratulating their opponents and sharing faux battle scars.

The two older men met in the centre, clearly in need of canes and cups of tea and stood about an arm width apart. The taller of the two snapped his heels together and produced an exeptionally well oiled salute. His opposite number visibly laughed, returned the salute and shook hands thoroughly before walking off with their prospective teams. 

Calling the next group to ready for battle I looked at the roster and scanned to see a Rolf and a Dmitri with ages listed as 91 each. Each team shared their leaders surnames. Chuckling to myself I checked the roster for the next match, to then realize they were booked in for next week too.
