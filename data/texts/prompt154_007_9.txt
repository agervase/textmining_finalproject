**Part 1**

Steel plunged into flesh. Sinking. Twisting. Scraping against bone. Then an abrupt stop, as steel met a concrete floor feasting on crimson.

There was a smile on his face, almost jubilant, as he let out a satisfied sigh, turned away from the body, looked me in the eye.

"He was a fighter, I'll give him that. You found his stash?"

"Yep, right here," as I pat a heavy gym bag.

"Alright, let's get outa here."

When we arrived it was packed, the sucker was trying to make a run for it. But it also meant we had a snitch. Not that it mattered. We pull out of the warehouse, pause to light the gas, and peel away as the flames start crawling.

"Man did you see how he was twitching at the end? Shit." He takes a long pull from a cigarette, exhaling slowly out the window. 

"Hell yea Diego, we're the South End Boys, and that was a South End Boy style execution."

It was typical for us to leave the knife behind. We got them pretty cheap, twenty five bucks for a pack of ten from a Chinese restaurant supply across the state. A little sharpening, a little shove, and we took one step closer to Hell. All in all, a pretty good deal.

But not me, of course. I was NYPD. And today, I finally had enough evidence to put these fuckers in a cage for the rest of their lives. Diego. Raul. Ong. Lambert. Jameson. Tuck-

"Hey man, you missed the goddamn turn."

"Fuck, my bad." 

"Hey man, you good?"  

"Yea man ... what's up?"

"No I mean ... you just be sweating ... like a lot motherfucker. Get a fucking headband, shit!" he laughs.

**Part 2**

3 million United States Dollars, sitting on a table, with fucking eight degenerates ogling it like kids on Christmas morning. Of course it wasn't cash. It was piles of snow. It would be worth closer to 1 million after all the pushers took their cut. Still, a fucking good haul, and I let them enjoy their fantasies. Little did they know.

Of course Diego and I skimmed on the ride over. NYPD pays fucking fifty grand a year and I had some dreams of my own. Either way we already got the cash for it. But only I'd be able to spend it.

Any second now the door would be busted open. 

**Part 3**

"What the fuck, Diego." 

"Hey man, stabbing people is ... kinda fun?"

I'm NYPD. He's FBI. Everyone else ... also fucking government agents. In total, we killed thirty three, well thirty four if driving someone off the road by accident counts. Laundered $35 million, and dealt another $18 million in narcotics. Funny thing is, our bosses got the shit taken out of them. The South End Boys? Well, we all fucking retired and went our separate ways for the most part ... after eight years running one of the biggest operations we'd all stashed away enough money for ten lifetimes.

"Well, fucking cheers to that man."

"Chill man, I don't stab people anymore. It was just ... an elaborate act."

We were all psychopaths anyways.

Our feet were dipped in the warm waters of Singapore, dangling off the side of Diego's latest purchase - a twenty foot yacht. We were headed to Bali for the weekend, but in reality it would probably turn into a month. 

Those waves weren't going to surf themselves.
