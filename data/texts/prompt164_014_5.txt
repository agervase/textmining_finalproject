Bones in the fish we try to eat. Seagulls with murder on the agenda. We can't even go to a fish market without a zombie fish attack. The minions of the demonic shark are numerous and unfathomable.

&#x200B;

Or, at least, were. Lately they've become sluggish. Fewer than in number. Unmotivated.

&#x200B;

Eventually, the time between attacks changed from hours, to days, to weeks, to months. While we welcomed the respite, it also made us very uneasy. We decided the ask about the change the next attack, if it ever came.

&#x200B;

It took a few months, but it did, and by now we were burning with curiosity. Did the shark give up? Was he gone? What has stopped this centuries old feud to simply peter out and die?

&#x200B;

Surprisingly, when we asked the lethargic gull about the turn of events, the answer was unexpected but understandable. The shark's popularity was tanking.

&#x200B;

Since the shark's creation so long ago, a monster born from an ancient creature beyond history, his way was destruction. That is, until he met a certain pirate captain who drew his ire. His flamboyant disregard for the ancient terrors of the deep, his implacable demeanor under attack from even the fiercest of krakens or machinations of the mind-destroying abominations that dwelled beneath the waves. The shark, who viewed itself as the fiercest and most powerful of the creatures of the sea, vowed to see the pirate's life extinguished, and his line ended.

&#x200B;

In his pursuit, however, he never killed the captain. He never finished off his family. Centuries of an endless barrage was weathered by the pirate's family until our generation today, and it had been with indifference towards the shark's deluge. The ancestor's spirit was a part of the lineage.

&#x200B;

And when our family moved from the islands of the Carribean for the burgeoning nation of America, we wondered if the shark could even bother us. And so we found he could, indirectly, through the use of his mystical powers and an aquatic army. Truly his rage hadn't waned for him to use creatures he viewed as inconsequential and worthless, in his drive to kill our family.

  
We now find ourselves in the current era, the current generation of that pirate's line. And these times have been hard on the creatures of the oceans. This was especially so for the shark's followers.

&#x200B;

They followed him not just for awe of his power, or by his own subjugation of them. But for he promised them safety. He promised their species would propagate across the seas and they would live lives without fear of hunger.

&#x200B;

However, due to recent human-caused disasters, his fanatic followers slowly became disillusioned. Their decreasing morale kept the shark busy as well, and it found itself without time to enact the magic that would usually join the physical assaults.

&#x200B;

The attack today was by the last of his followers, who are too influenced by his power and fear his wrath to leave him, even though they lack the resources to continue enacting his will. So they will return, every so often, under the mad delusion of an ineffectual demon shark who has been consumed by a rage it's held for centuries

&#x200B;

We thought, with the birds and fish's departure, that it had finally come to somewhat of an end.

&#x200B;

At least, until the lovecraftian horror showed up on our doorstep.
