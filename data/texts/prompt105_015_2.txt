On the day of September 17th 2019, Jesus Christ made his second coming upon Earth. This event was largely irrelevant and overhyped, and was widely panned by critics. If one is having trouble sleeping, one may find drab and meticulously detailed accounts of the event in any contemporary history book. 

What is relevant—at least in the following account—was the phenomenon ensuing thereafter, which humanity called, for lack of a better word, *Blood-Hue*. To instill in humanity an even deeper sense of guilt and dread than had already existed since apes learned to experience anxiety, the Powers That Be had altered the nature of human blood to reflect the level of Sin of the human being to which it belonged. Blood from people without Sin was no longer red, but white, and blood from people with a great deal of Sin was no longer red, but black. Sin was a word for "badness" that Humanity and The Powers That Be had collectively come up with a very long time ago as a measuring stick of who people should hate and of how much they should hate themselves. The new change in color was scoffed at by the general public, met with horror by spectrophotometrists, and embraced fondly by law enforcement.

On the day of July 4th 2022, at around 11:30 P.M., Ethan Jameson was inside of Jessica Merkel's apartment when he opened a bottle of Valium—which had been prescribed to Jessica Merkel—and consumed its entire contents, followed by a bottle of vodka. He then proceeded to drive a short distance to the WalMart where Jessica Merkel worked in stocking, sneak into a meat freezer, hide, and curl up into a ball. 

Jessica Merkel, at the time, was asleep. She would not know what Ethan had done until one of her coworkers found him the following morning and called her in a state of panic. He was dead.
