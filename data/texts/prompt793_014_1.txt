The world had gone mad. But this was the way it should be.

I floated above the hospital below me on the ghostly wings of Giratina beneath me, obscured from the views of those beneath me. There was a multitude of ambulances outside the hospital, wheeling in the injured from Gary's latest attack. A subordinate of his had EMP'd all of  Goldenrod City with Jolteon before taking out Whitney and her defenders with his Hariyama, both Crisis Leveled, or Demon Ranked Disasters according to the old Federation scale.

&#x200B;

A strong subordinate, not many of Gary's can pull that kind of strength, probably Giovanni. Back before the world had discovered the machinations of the Elite Gym Giovanni had already sold out to Gary, seduced by the promise of power and rulership. And he could have done it too. Gary was strong, my grandfather would always tell me back then in his silent way. Even though I wasn't alive then I had always heard those were good times. My grandfather had resisted Gary and was able to stop him, little did everyone know how deep Gary's preparations had run.

A poisonous miasma from Koffing had taken out most of the loyalists to my grandfather before the alliance of the Federation of Teams under the Dark Elite had delivered the world to Gary like a cooked fish on a silver platter, brushing aside all resistance as easily as dried seaweed.

&#x200B;

Well, almost all. My mother made sure of that. Even Gary had been in shock when he first battled my mother. One of the other things my grandfather would continue to tell me in his own silent way. I knew it. My mother was special. A trainer so beloved by Pokemon she was called a once in a millenia genius. She single-handedly (well almost single-handedly) brought down the Federation by enraging the Legends. 

&#x200B;

And yet people will be people. When a person in power abuses one group, many others find an excuse to do so. Abusing Pokemon because they see themselves better, more superior. "We train them not the other way around" became their slogan. Missing the very essence of what being a trainer is.

As my mom always said, "You must triumph over personal weakness to overcome the weakness in the world". That is why my grandfather told me, "........". That is why my name is Black.

&#x200B;

Because before before the Dawn can break, the Darkness is at it's strongest.
