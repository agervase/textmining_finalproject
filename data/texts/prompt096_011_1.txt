It was prom night. All by bff's were about to pull up to my house any minute. This is the night I feel like I've been waiting for all my life. But I had one problem though... No date. As soon as the anxiety kicked in from feeling like I will be alone forever three loud knocks at my front door broke my attention. They were here. I ran to the door excitedly and greeted my friends, Patricia and Gwindalin. As soon as they entered the door they both screened with glee and we admired eachothers dresses. As soon as that dopamine rush of feeling accepted by others was over gwindalina pulled out a bottle. "what's that?" I asked. She looked up with a slight grin and said "Bloody Mary". I was terrified and excited at the same time, alcohol was new to me, but really was not wanting to look like a prude bitch with my friends. We agreed that we would all finish the bottle once we arrived in Patricia's brand new Mercedes Benz. We parked and my heart began to race. Gwindalin pulled 3 water bottles full of the red stuff. We all three grabbed a bottle and opened it. The sharp smell penetrated my nose. This was it. The girls lifted their bottles to the center of the car and I quickly followed. Patricia began chanting "Bloody Mary" we repeated maybe 4 or 5 times before downing our drinks. But the last couple of times I caught myself looking in the mirror. This was me now. Drinking alcohol. What a great kid I am. As I opened my eyes after the jarring effects the alchool had on me I noticed something in the rear view mirror. I wasnt hallucinating my friends noticed too and quickly put the car in drive. Patricia gassed the car and slammed into the nearest tree. The car blew up. The end
