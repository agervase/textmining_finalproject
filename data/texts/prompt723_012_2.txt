`9 days later: Whoops, did not hit submit.`

"They **knew** of *us*."  
--the initial excitement from the machines set to catalogue their 'internet' discovering what was undeniably an illustration of a member of *our* species in traditional dress, hundreds of generations before we even knew another world existed.

*We* should have realised that so much of their fiction describing impossible travel we hadn't considered possible would have stemmed from having such accomplishments already.  What offspring has not naively dreamt of heroically visiting other worlds in impossible imitation of the possibilities of planetary exploration.

*We* naively believed that these "humans" totally destroyed their world by *chance*. That changed after that first image was found by *chance*. I don't know if *we* should thank the *makers* for proscribing all information containers be given a cursory scan, or curse their folly. 

Sadly before this (now barren) planet could be re-categorized *we*'d already dismissed what archaeological merit the wreckage had and have already smelted much of it for the rare-metals often found in their information devices. Particularly since the constant radiation bath has scoured so much of the physical data away that recovering it was almost physically impossible, and too resource intensive to be worthwhile.
> That too changed.

In the mania that followed the image, many less refined illustrations were found and eventually linked back to a monolithic database of similar illustrations, prosaically titled `e621.net`^(`NSFW, fools!`). Only it wasn't only *our* species and humans that were catalogued. Some 9300 "species", All neatly tagged and recorded interacted with this evidently pan-galactic society. -- now *extinct*.

If the listing is as representative of their numbers as that key-illustration is of our natural history, `species:human` were apparently only the eighth most encountered species. Being vastly numbered by `species:canine` and by an absurd margin by something called a `species:mammal`.
> Feh.  `species:mammal` may refer to a common or ancestral species. *We* and the other known *surviving* species seem to be also tagged `species:monster` in addition to our respective species.

If these encounters are representative of the population sizes at the time this planet was "[cold pasteurized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_irradiation)^(wikipedia.org)" - our having been vastly out-populated at one time is worrying, but not so much as why we would now appear to be the dominant surviving species.

Presuming that this database *is* evidence that humans achieved interstellar travel far beyond what *we* are capable of in "real space"- be it via wormholes or teleportation- but almost they almost completely erased practical knowledge of this discipline of "magic". But with this new frontier open to *us*, *we* are spreading too fast to coordinate w/ the other species.

`...`  
Caution that perhaps this erasure wasn't an accident.  Many pieces of human fiction suggest that ideas and concepts would invite *`outside`* entities into *our mind* with results not conducive to life. Some taking the form of memetichazards. It is possible that this was done to prevent something from following/spreading.

*Our* machine's attempts to piece together the human AI have resulted in many entering into some form of existential crisis.  *We* do not *yet* know why.
