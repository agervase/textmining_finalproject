Journal entry one: This didn't make sense. It couldn't make sense. How could history just rewrite itself like that? I know the science folk joke about being in a simulation, but if it were true, am I a glitch? Oh gods... Gods if any exist! Did I will them into this world as well? What if I am a glitch? The computer lab teacher Johnson always complained about little glitches here and there, I've seen his projects. He always stamps the big ones first. How big of a glitch am I? I need to stop. I need to read the books before every lesson. I can't deviate anymore like that. I may get noticed...

Journal entry two: I've noticed life is a little stranger. More people are aproaching me with offers... A sample of Shampoo Care Products, an offer to The School Catering to the Past, a letter offer in the mail to sign up for Succulent Chicken Platters. The latter is tempting but the frequency and sudden surge of this scares me... I think I've been found out. I need to run. I need to hide. These must be a sign, more people like me. They're warning me. I'll rewrite history and hide in the folds. I'll make a pocket for myself and hide away. I don't want to die.

Gods help me if you're even real anymore...

Following the 2nd entry, Doctor Salmo was neutralized in his flat by MTF "Reality Check". Authoritie's records have been edited to show suicide was by a homemade fire arm that failed to fire correctly and exploded instead. Target was eliminated before The Foundation was able to dispatch their MTF into the area. After the neutralization, MTF member Foxtrot had an urge to sit down when suddenly a piece of furniture previously in the opposite corner of the room appeared behind him. The chair has been deemed anomalous and has been taken away for termination.
