\[I modified the prompt slightly to be from a sentient civilization not inhabiting Earth\]

"It took forever to sort out the rubble of graveyard 2018\-E. Never have we found so many bones of different species mixed together in the same areas." Professor Durn's voice trailed on in the same monotonous tone as always. I don't understand why, of all classes, this boring archaeological history class had to taught verbally. Why couldn't we just use the info\-visors like we did in history class? "Ironically the similar biology of all their creatures was not the most perplexing information. In fact, we still debate the psychology..." My word, still talking? I swear it doesn't even matter if I fall asleep in this class. I'd probably wake up before the end of the lecture anyway. That's how school is I guess. We learn boring things about boring subjects. Honestly, I bet we'll never use most of it anyway. "So I'd like to try something different for next class. All of you must complete a research assignment on what we don't see at first glance in this civilization. You will share your findings in front of your peers." What!? A verbal presentation? Physically in front of our peers? This has got to be a joke. I definitely just re\-entered that lecture wrong. I'll just ask someone after class.

Another eternity later, I'm finally headed home. I caught up to Laeran, who was holding the shuttle for me as usual. We take our seats towards the back, since that's the best spot \(you feel the rumble of the engines and practically lift off your seat\).

Before I even ask, Laeran graciously brings up the topic, "Durn seems awfully invested in this lesson plan."

"Yeah. Being a new professor, Durn's position is probably riding on good feedback from us.", I responded. "That assignment, crazy right? I don't ev\-"

"Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.", she chimed in. "We've got to report on something the archaeologists didn't see when first analyzing the organic composition of the planet."

I quickly tried to pick up the conversation as I was visibly embarrassed.

"We can make entire simulated presentations in a matter of minutes and Durn wants us to talk?", I asked.

"Yup. I think it's actually kind of clever. We're using a simple method to convey information about a complex topic. I'm  thinking about investigating the planet's technology. It'd be fun to compare their *advanced* systems to our own. Like you said, we can create incredible simulations with basic skills.", she answered.

Hmm, technology... It was kinda clever, but is Durn being serious giving us a riddle for an assignment. Suddenly it clicked. If Professor Durn wanted to be clever, I would respond in kind. I'd just give a verbal report on the civilization's virtual presence.

"Let me know if you need any help", Laeran teased.

"Same to you.", I chuckled. "Oh, looks like we're nearly home."

Amazing, out of a three star system, we not only lived within the same district of planets but on the same one. *Small world,* I thought with a laugh.

The next archaeological history class was at the beginning of the next solar cycle. I had accumulated a bunch of data on the small planet we were studying, but listing facts didn't feel like I was beating the riddle. Bored by this class yet again, I decided see what the Homo Sapiens used to do for fun. One word in particular came up multiple times. The *Internet*. I got a link\-key for the Hall of Records and Information's department on other virtual data. I set up the standard virtual work space and loaded the key. At first glance, my findings were correct, as there wasn't really much to look at. This species was struggling to even create one fully simulated world. I decided to do some reading since I had already loaded the key. Finally I think I understood the assignment. Laeran called at some point. I hadn't realized, it was already only three moon rotations before the presentation. I answered the voice chat. "Laeran you got some spare time? I want to show you something..."

The day of the presentation had come. Some students had presented facts about the language systems, the biodegradable materials that were actually tools, or the basic social structure. It came my turn, and I looked to Laeran. We both got up from our seats and stood at the front of the room.

Laeran began, "Initially, we were going to focus on facts like most of our classmates. We were also going to present separately like everyone else as well. But, our presentation isn't about what one person did. And it cannot be shared by only one person either. That's why we both stand here now, because this is about a collective. The Humans called it the Internet. It could be used individually, yet you were never alone."

My voice shook, but I continued with as much confidence as I could muster, "There are things we will never understand. There are people we will never meet. We can dig up their bones and deduce what their tools were for, and still we wouldn't understand them. There are some things you'll never feel unless you experience it face to face, like we are now.", I continued with fire in my voice, "However, in this virtual world, in these people's *Internet*, we get as close to the experience as we can. We get to see something that archaeologists couldn't see in the rubble. The struggles they overcame. The inspiration they had. The strength they had in always rising from the ashes. The beautiful lives they lived. We get to see their stories."

I saw a grin on Durn's face. This was the assignment.

"If you'll allow us a bit more of your time, we'd like to share some with you. We'd like to recount the stories of Earth."
