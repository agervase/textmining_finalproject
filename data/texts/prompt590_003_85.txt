I've only seen a metal hatch like this once before, in our capital city of New Denver. It guards the vault where our ancestors took shelter from the great war, and held the Garden of Eden Creation Kits (G.E.C.K) that we used to stabilize the world after the nuclear holocaust subsided. Now because of our researcher's ability to understand the technology behind G.E.C.K, most of the remains of the Western United States has been reunited, with the exclusion of California as there is still some strong resistance to our movement. If there is a possibility of more G.E.C.Ks being located within this vault I knew our team needed to investigate. Although we were a research team meant only to study the environmental damages done from the bombs, we were certain no vault could survive this long without opening.
&nbsp;

I make my way to the control panel where I expected my Pip Boy to allow me to open the door, however, the adapter seems different for this vault, and beyond that the language on the controls seems to be something pre-war. From my studies in history classes it seems to be some form of mandarin.
&nbsp;

After discussing my discovery with the team it was decided that the vault should still be opened to determine if Chinese vaults had the technology to sustain life for this long. If the Chinese still were around after the nuclear barrage released by the U.S there could be a large potential threat to our society. With this we begin working with the electronics trying to rewire the door to open. 
&nbsp;

Finally, a large creaking sound signals the opening of the door. As ice crunches and icicles  are released from their resting places the door opens and lights from inside the vault turn on. We entered the vault, and were surprised to find luxuries we could only have dreamed of. The softest red velvet carpet I have ever seen, and gold statues adorning the walls down a long hallway. Everything seemed to be intact but there were no signs of people. Nervously we crept forward.
&nbsp;

As we came to the end of the hallway we came to an intersection and as we were deciding which way to turn, two men came out from the left and from the right holding some sort of energy weapon. Reflexively I put my hand on my hip preparing myself to use my weapon. Then from the end of the hallway I heard a voice. It was in English and I was surprised.
&nbsp;

"What are you doing in our vault?" the voice echoed.
&nbsp;

I looked around expecting the team leader to respond, but he seemed locked in fear. I spoke up and said as confidently as I could, that we were only researchers seeking shelter from a blizzard. 
The man who questioned us seemed distraught. 
&nbsp;

Again, he questioned us saying, "The radiation has subsided, but has the ice?"
&nbsp;

Unwilling to let them know of the rebirth of the world due to our G.E.C.Ks I tell them the world is still covered by a sheet of ice and then try to act disheartened. 
&nbsp;

Seemingly desperate, he asks "You walk the surface, does this mean it is safe for us?"
&nbsp;

I let them know that we can only stay out for hours at a time before we need to return to base.
Angrily the man walks closer, "Then you are not welcome here, you need to leave either on your own or as a pile of ashes."
&nbsp;

The guards began escorting us out and as we reached the surface I drew my weapon. I shot both the guards before they could react and grabbed on of their energy weapons. 
&nbsp;

My team stood there utterly shocked and asked what I thought I was doing. I responded by telling them we needed to seal this vault for good in order to keep our society safe. We could hear yelling from the end of the corridor. Quickly, we began closing the vault door and then short circuited the wires. It would buy us some time. 
As the vault closed, I left the energy weapon directly outside of it. After reaching a safe distance, I look down the sights of my gun. It's hard to aim when shaking from the cold. I take a deep breath and fire, as I did this a large glowing orb of fire appeared in front of the vault. It was so bright I had to turn away. I looked back and saw the door had been welded shut by the blast. 
&nbsp;

Now it was only a matter of finding their ventilation system, and then we could return home to New Denver and report what we encountered.

Quick note-- I am not a writer by any means, and I am known for my terrible grammar. Sorry, if it was a little hard to read at times, but I thought my idea was cool and I just wanted to get it out there.
