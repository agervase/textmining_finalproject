At first it had been a joke, borne out of late nights trying to wrap my head around French grammar. In between wishing an excruciatingly painful afterlife on the person who invented irregular verbs, I had a thought-- what if I invented a language that was actually *easy* to learn? And so Baconese was born.

Beyond coming up with a few bits of vocabulary, I didn't give much thought to it until a few weeks later, when I was home sick with nothing to do. My mind wandered to Baconese, and in a fit of inspiration, I created rules for grammar and punctuation.

I spent every study hall after that developing the language. Baconese, by the way, has incredibly easy verb conjugation, no rolled 'r's, and not a single irregular word to speak of (screw you, French). I even began working on a dictionary, although I left that in a classroom and forgot all about it... until now.

"***You too***?" Chris asks, eyes widening, lips curving around the foreign tongue in a way that sounds all too practiced for my liking. And then he does the unthinkable: he smiles. At me. The biggest nerd in the school. *Me*. "Wow."

"How did you, uh..." I try to put the words together, my heart racing. "***You speak Baconese***?"

"***I'd say I'm pretty fluent***," Chris says. "***Sorry, gotta get to football practice. See you later?***"

"See ya," I say, so dumbstruck that I forget to translate.

Chris doesn't see me later-- at least, not for awhile- but I do see Baconese pop up again, this time in written form.

I'm rummaging through a History textbook when a piece of crumpled notepaper falls out. It's a bunch of dates and events, with a few short sentences describing the War of 1812, or the fall of the Berlin Wall-- and it's all in Baconese.

It doesn't take me long to put it together. I am now the creator of a language used by students across my high school to cheat on tests.

If I were a better person, I'd feel guilty, even ashamed. But instead I laugh.

Chris sidles up to me behind the building, cast in shadows. He's traded his varsity jacket for a black sweatshirt and jeans that allow him to blend into the darkness of the late evening. "***All set up, boss***."

"***Thank you, Christopher***. ***This money's gonna keep us in business for a long, long time.****"*

"***You really think we got away with it? I mean, this is the biggest cheating scam in, like, all of human history.***"

I smirk at Chris. "***It is? Then it's time to break another record.***"

Shoulders brushing against each other's, we slip back into the forest and cut across the unsuspecting town, only stopping to cackle maniacally as we relish in the feat we've just pulled off.
