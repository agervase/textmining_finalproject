"Ye've got to talk some sense into him," said Auntie Arm-n'-Hammer. "Och, it's just not right!"

"Fine." Papa BlackPorter finished his stout and wiped the creamy head from his mustache and beard. "But ye've got to work the bellows in my place until I'm back!"

Papa BlackPorter climbed up the long, long, long staircase to the stone gate. He hefted the gate with all his might; the gate to the surface was not meant to be opened and closed very often and resisted his efforts to leave the mountain. He blinked in the sunlight and wondered how his son could tolerate the surface.

The last time Papa BlackPorter had seen his son DeepStone, the young dwarf had set up a tent just outside the gate. The tent was gone. Papa BlackPorter spun slowly and examined his blurry surroundings. Dwarven eyes can focus finely on objects up-close, but rarely have reason to focus on objects in the distance; he really had to strain his vision to sight a tall, tall, tall stone tower a mile up the mountain.

He hiked to it and ran his hands over the tower's walls. The workmanship of the masonry was as good as DeepStone's fingerprint to the experienced Papa BlackPorter. "Come out, son, I know yer in there! It's not right, leavin' the mountain and buildin' towers! It's not the dwarven way!"

When he heard no answer, Papa BlackPorter circled the tower looking for an entrance. He found none; DeepStone had built the tower around himself from the inside. Papa BlackPorter took his trusty pickaxe from his belt and tunneled through the tower wall. 

Inside the tower there was a staircase. Papa BlackPorter sighed as he climbed. Dwarves should never be so near the sky!

At the tower's ceiling there was a wooden hatch. Papa BlackPorter opened it and saw his son DeepStone sitting on the tower's ceiling's center. "Come down, son, yer gonna get sky-poisoning up here!"

DeepStone was unnaturally tanned by the sun. He wore black goggles to protect his eyes from alchemy ingredients arranged before him. He watched a Bunsen burner boil brown sludge in a glass flask as he powdered pebbles with a pestle. 

Papa BlackPorter approached with a canteen of emergency alcohol. "Son, how long has it been since yer last drink?"

"I drink pure water, now, father. I pull it from the air." 

"I mean a stiff drink, lad."

"Not since I left the underground."

Papa BlackPorter opened the canteen and put it under his son's beard. The canteen's contents were strong enough to made DeepStone's mustache curl. "Drink, son. Please."

"Do you wonder why there aren't any dwarven wizards?" asked DeepStone. His father had no answer. "It's because we don't apply ourselves."

"Yer not talkin' right."

"Father, look."

DeepStone put down his pestle and donned a thick glove. With the glove, he turned off the Bunsen burner and tilted the glass flask of boiled brown sludge. He poured the sludge through a screen. 

On the screen remained flecks of blue metal. Papa BlackPorter covered his mouth. "Is that---"

"Mythril," said DeepStone. "Material of Elven Magicians."

"Did you---" Papa BlackPorter squinted at the blue flecks. "Did you make this with magic?"

"Dwarven magic. Alchemy. It's not flashy stage-show magic, but I figure it oughta take the Elves down a peg or two."

"Aw, that's my boy!" Papa BlackPorter hugged his son close. "I can't claim to understand ye, but I approve of yer alternative lifestyle!"
