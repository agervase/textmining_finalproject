**Transcripts from the Orion Empire Archive**

*History of the Lost ones*

It is said that death awaits us all. Yet that has no weight when it comes to science, as science has shown evidence that through trial and perserverance the greatest of odds can be accomplished. Sadly, even mysticism has proven to survive side by side with the unknown as our unwillingness to believe that mysticism is the defacto law of the Universe Prototype, just merely ghosts that remain from before our existence.
This came to light with the founding of the Galactic Orion Empire. No one is certain to this day who this 'humanity' individual was or what race he had come from. Just that the total annihilation of Orions was subvertly undone by the appearance of "The Man of Nylon." To this day sceptics criticize the source material of the journal recovery from *The Needle* stating it is unfactual as it was written by a child. Still, this has not hindered anyone from naming their daughters Humani or their sons Humanity in honor of the folklore as evidence of the ancient crash site suggests their may have been an ancient visiting life form that changed the path history was to repeat. Below is the transcript.

*"Mother would not speak to me. She was too busy crying at the loss of brother. I don't understand why they won't open the door. He's still out there. He's out there with Uncle, and sissie, and nana, and the rest of them! She won't answer me."*

*"I asked father what was happening and he just gave me a sadden glare. He spoke silently saying "we had failed to save the ozone." I'm not sure what he means. I have heard some of the older adults arguing that they needed to find a way to power down the 'reactor' but no one has answered me when I pressed for an answer on what the 'reactor' was! One of them even began crying when I asked constatly saying "we succeeded with messages, but failed with people!'"*

*"I'm scared. The room is slowly getting hotter and the video screens have all gone dark, glowing red with 'warning' written all over it. There's a loud screeching outside! It's even gotten the attention of the adults. The sky is glowing a bright blue! It's almost beautiful..."*

*"The earth is shaking now. A loud noise is echoing through the building. Everyone's freaking out! Momma won't stop crying and father has disappeared! Someone's shouting that the reactor has exploded... What's going on." 
"Everything's gone quiet for a while. There's a subtle knocking on the front door. People are afraid to open it but father's not. He boldly walked up while others didn't. There's a man behind it. He's made of puffy white fabric and has a video screen for a face! He told us "Sorry I'm late." Mommy is telling me everything will be okay. I'm still scared though. The outside... it doesn't look the same as it did earlier."*

Details of the encounter are still held at face value. Other writing material and reports from data logs that we were able to retrieve point that this being crashed his ship into what was dubbed "the reactor" to neutralize the pulsar forming in its core that was slowly heating the planet. They said he had also released a mist across the sky to quickly cool the planet back to stable levels. How much of this is true is still unknown, but is always a fun story to tell children.

 It is good to note that anyone with a basic understanding of FTL know that a ship transporter must be placed outside of habitable zones as it is known to destruct entire galaxies and only small ones can be habited on planets for communications only. Hence why many prefer generation ships to other planets over dark zones where such reactors exist. It is suggested that the early Orions had constructed one on their planet in hopes of faster travel which resulted in a fail safe. Again, how much of this is true is still argued, but similar myths exist not only with us, but as well as the Cinooans, and the Myrthiex Empire and the Druien Cohorts. As such, it is left to mystery what really happened that day and who this Humanity individual was.
