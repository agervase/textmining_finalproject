He closed his eyes. Felt for the pull. Not the usual kind. By request? The US, Detroit, a run down scuzzy block of apartments. 32nd floor door 325. He opened his eyes. 

She was young despite the weariness in her eyes. Sat on the couch hugging her knees, staring listlessly at the far wall. The tall man could sense the soul in the other room. Sense its fear and its rage an inferno of emotion. That wasn't enough to warrant a personal call, not from him.  There was no one else here so that left the girl. 
 
The place was easy enough to read, syringes and pipes on the table, the scent of skunk embedded deep in the smoke stained walls. Bags of white and brown powder under the TV cabinet, the good stuff hidden in an old computer tower. Little sign of a home, no pictures on the walls, battered furniture - neglected rather than lived in, dishes piling up in the sink. He'd been to a lot of places like this. 

Easing himself through the wall the tall man stepped into the bedroom. A body lay on the bed, caucasian, medium height, well built naked from the waist down. No tell tale scars, smart enough to shoot up somewhere less conspicious. The soul was like smoke, boiling and thrashing with fury seeking something, anything to hurt, strike down. It surged towards the him screaming incoherent profanaties. Visitor held up one pale hand, the smoke falling back, said a single word "Quiet." softly spoken but with a power born of ages.  It didn't calm, still seething but fell back, hovering over its body no longer able to reach out. 

Flowing through back into the living room, back to the girl he stood in front of her and reached out touching her forehead whilst she stared straight through him. 

Saw the first time she'd been beaten. 8 years old, her dad hit her because she couldn't get her baby brother to stop crying. Saw her mom hanging from light fitting in the basement, eyes staring, staring. One of the only 2 good things in her life gone. That was when she first saw him. Dressed sharp in a black suit, white shirt, dark hair and azure blue eyes. You'd think they'd be black but no. He was gentle. Her mom gave her a hug before she faded from sight and she could feel it, warm and loving and sorry God so sorry. That warmth stayed with her for a week. The guy in the suit had sat with her, told her that her mom was going on a trip so somewhere really far away. Said he wasn't allowed to say where she was going but she'd get where she was meant to. He spoke slow and soft, he hugged the little girl as she cried, said he was sorry. The first kindness anyone had really shown her.

Saw her brothers funeral one of those tiny coffins that despite it's size is always the heaviest weight. He'd been there for this too, sitting on the edge of her bed as her dad raged. She'd tried to get him to stop shaking Alex but he'd shouted so loud she'd run and hidden under the covers. He dried her eyes and told her he was so sorry. That he wished he could help. Made another exception and let her see Alex one last time, give him a hug. He'd been impressed with how brave she was. 

Saw her dad passed out in his own vomit as she left the house for the last time at 15. 
Saw her sleeping on park benches, huddled in alleyways trying to get out of the wind. 
She turned tricks to get by, drugs to escape the horror of her little world.

The first had been a dealer who raped her friend. It was the perfect reason. She'd stabbed her in her sleep as she lay next to her. He hadn't spoken this time just looked at her with those sad blue eyes shaking his head. To see him sad, dissapointed has been like an icicle through her heart. He reacted the same way when she poisoned the pimp who'd beaten her up two days before. 

The had been others since, mostly bad people. She was sorry for the ones who weren't. 

Oh. Right. 

It made sense now.

The tall man opened his eyes and sat down on the otherside of the couch. 

"Hi."

She jumped turning to look at him, expression desperate and hopeful. But the blue eyes she sought weren't there instead his just a shade off black. 

"Who... who are you? Where is he?!" She was scared, shying back, huddling in the corner as far away as she could get. 

"A friend of his." Not exactly a lie, not exactly truth. "I don't think he wants to see you right now." 

"Why isn't he here?" her voice small, defeated. 

"He'll be along later I think. He asked me to talk to you."

"Why doesn't he want to see me? Please...I just want to talk to him."

"Because he cares. Not easy for someone in his line of work." The tall man paused picking his next words carefully. I don't think he likes what you're doing."

"Please...." her voice shrunk further, barely a whisper.

"He won't." He sighed, not exasperated. Tired." You've done some bad things. I know why. I don't blame you. You've built up a certain debt though. He doesn't want you carrying it I don't think. But... there is a way around it."

"What do you want?"

"To offer you a job."
