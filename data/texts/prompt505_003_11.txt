Not only was I bored, but I was thirsty. So when one day, I hear a prayer arising from a small town in Northern Russia concerning a drinking contest, I paid attention.

This man, claiming to be some sort of drinking prodigy, was in trouble. He had run into some payment issues with the local gangsters and needed nothing short of divine intervention to save himself and his family from the wrath of cigarettes and adidas tracksuits.

Bored as I was, I was happy to oblige. It seemed low-risk. I quickly answered his prayer, transporting myself down to Earth and whispering in his ear, "I will meet you here, 24 hours from now. I will bring the drinks."

25 hours later, and we are through our second bottle. Immediately, I knew this was no mere mortal. A bottle of vodka should result in some side effects, even for the most drunken human. But here he is, cutting it up with me, showing no signs of slowing down. But I'm not worried. As the god of alcohol, the stuff is purified from my body as I wish, so I am not afraid of losing. But dammit if he seems to be unaffected as well!

That's when it hits me.

"What's your name?" I ask the man, only seeming like a question I had any interest in knowing the answer to.
"Slav, but most people just call me "The Machine"" he says.
I feel a lump forming at the back of my throat,
"And who gave you that name?"
"My mother."

Oh Abijah, you wonderful woman.

"It's time we met," I said "Machine, I am your father."
I wait for his surprised reaction, but get none. As he takes his next shot, he winks, "I know."

Days later, he cedes the contest to me. But no mobsters appear at his house again, and until the day he died, that bottle of vodka sitting in his cabinet was always full somehow, though its contents were routinely emptied.

Thus is the legend of the Machine.
