There is conflict, both on the small blue marble that the mortals called "Earth", and in the heavens and realms above. Yahweh added his own unending strength to the chains that bound Fenrir and Apollo kept the days from changing in Brahma. The various gods, titans and deities duked it out, competing to keep the others' end times at bay. Not for the benefit of humanity, but to maintain their own strength, to keep the faith as long as it could be held. Every prediction passed to a "prophet" done so specifically to make another God to be a fool, their belief to waiver, and their strength to wane. After all, once this planet ended, the creation of the next would fall to whoever won, allowing them to shape their own belief, as it had been before. Machinations and assassinations of immortals came and passed, and rebirths happened to each God, caught in an endless struggle.

There was, however, a catch. these beings, powerful as they were, only gained their strength from belief, long since having forgotten the genesis of their own being, forgetting where their powers were derived from. And in that, they forgot the smaller beings that shared their planes with them, shared their origins. A small, tired looking being walked among the Gods, avoiding their conflicts where possible, and simply deflecting them from themself when they had to. A heavy fur cloak was draped over his shoulders, covering a crimson robe underneath. From his pockets occasionally spilled fallen holy symbols. Over the years he had collected them, regarding them as the trinkets they were, and collecting them in his own small temple. Its replica on earth was hidden deep in the growth of a forgotten forest. Very few visited the temple, and even less believed in him anymore, so his power was weak. Long ago he'd been the representative of the Strength of Men, their will and their own desires. Oppressive Gods, those that demanded sacrifice and tribute, those that craved power, they had pushed him from Worship. And he hadn't minded much, he had never needed t be worshipped. But recently he had been gaining strength, even if people didn't know it. Pokes at humanity to trust themselves, to believe in their own will, to become better. and slowly the need for faith faded from the forefront, and the Gods weakened, even if they didn't know.

That was not to say they did not notice their strength failing, but more so they didn't suspect the long forgotten god. They assumed any part of him that attributed to it was mere coincidence and left him to his own devices. Occasionally Loki, ever the trickster, would ask him what he was up to, and he would shrug and shuffle on, tilting the crown of Hickory out of his face again. And from time to time other gods would stop and mock him for being dead and god already, that he would never know the ability to shape the universe. So while Allah and Aipaloovik exchanged blows, threatening to consume the planet, the small figure snuck away to his chambers, and regarded the mortal's device known as an iPad, and from it booted a small application. He observed the tone of humanity change, and they believed more and more in their own strength, as they flung small hungs of metal and lightning into the skies, and the grew more and more. These once simple creatures looked to the stars and wondered if they were alone. They sought the answers to the universe, to their very being, and fought to change it in their own image.

The other gods were right, an apocalypse was coming, but it wouldn't come to that small blue marble, it would come to them.
