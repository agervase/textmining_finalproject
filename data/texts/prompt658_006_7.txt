##DOCTOR Jacob Sands PATIENT LOG

###PATIENT: Sarah Vincelli

SANDS: "The following is a recording of my first appointment with the patient Sarah.  Sarah Vincelli is currently seven years old. The date is August 7th, 1993.  Her parents report that she is a bright child, but she has an unnerving habit of knowing things she shouldn't, and has started to become antisocial in recent months."

*(A pause, as the recorder is set down.)*

SANDS: "Please send the pa-  please send Sarah in."    
NURSE: "Yes, Doctor."    

*(Another pause. The sound of a door opening, shutting, opening again, then* slamming *shut.  Followed by the thwump of someone sitting in a seat with as much force as a seven-year-old girl can muster.)*

SANDS: "Hello, Sarah.  You seem upset."    
VINCELLI: *(mulish)* "Yeah."    
SANDS: Care to elaborate?    
*(Silence.)*    
SANDS: "What's wrong?"    
VINCELLI: "Mom thinks I'm crazy."    
SANDS: "What makes you say that?"    
VINCELLI: "You're a shrink, and Earnie says only crazy people see shrinks, and Mom sent me to you."    
SANDS: "Not just crazy people see... shrinks.  Who is Earnie?"    
VINCELLI: "He's my best friend. Mom doesn't like him."     
SANDS: "Oh?  Why not?"    
VINCELLI: "I don't know.  But she always acts like he's invisible.  Like you too."    
SANDS: "Like me?"    
VINCELLI: "You haven't even looked at him since we came in."     
SANDS: *(Puzzled.)* "I honestly didn't see anyone come with you, and you were supposed to come alone besides."    
*(The creak of the door opening.)*    
NURSE: "Doctor, sorry to interrupt, but Mrs. Vincelli said we have to cut this short.  There is a family emergency."    
VINCELLI: *(Annoyed.)* "Bye."    
*(The door creaks agains, then slams shut again with a sharp bang)*

*(Some rustling as the recorder is picked up.)*

SANDS: The patient was clearly upset to be here.  The only thing I was able to briefly discuss her apparently invisible friend, Earnie, and the fact that there seem to be some trust issues between herself and her mother.

###PATIENT: Alan Fife

SANDS:  "The following is a recording of my first appointment with the patient Allen.  Allen Fife is currently seven years old. The date is August 9th, 1993.  Her parents report that he is a bright child, but he has an unnerving habit of knowing things he shouldn't, and has started to become antisocial in recent months. *(A pause)* Note to self, go over recordings from previous appointments.  This seems very familiar."

*(Another pause as the recorder is set down.)*

SANDS: "Please send Alan in."    
NURSE: "Yes, Doctor."

*(The sound of the door opening, shutting, and the faint sound of arguing, before its cut off by the door opening and slamming again.)*

SANDS: "Hello, Alan.  Please have a seat."    
FIFE: "Earnie doesn't like you."    
SANDS: "Sorry?"    
FIFE: "I said 'Earnie doesn't like you.'"    
SANDS: "Who is Earnie and what makes you say that."    
FIFE: "He says you already know who he is, and I said it because he told me to."    
SANDS: "Why don't you have a seat so we can talk about Earnie and your other friends."   
FIFE: "No."    
SANDS: "Why not?"    
FIFE: "We'll be leaving soon."    
SANDS: "What makes y-"    
*(The sound of a door slamming open.)*    
WOMAN'S VOICE: "ALLEN!  We're leaving.  I'm sorry, Doctor, but something's come up."    
SANDS: *(Confused.)* "Reschedule for next week, Mrs. Fife?"    
MRS. FIFE: "I'll, I'll call you.  No time now.  Allen! Come ON!"     
ALLEN FIFE: "Mom, you're hurting me!"
*(The sound of several pairs of feet shuffling, and the door slamming again.)*

SANDS: "Now I remember.  Same as patient Sarah Vincelli.  Appointment for antisocial issues developing in the last few months, also cut short by what appears to be some emergency. Allen was more confrontational than Sarah.  He said I already knew who Earnie was, and there was no way he could know that."

###PATIENT: Max Pieterson

SANDS: "The following is a recording of my first appointment with the patient Max.  Max Pieterson is currently seven years old. The date is August 13th, 1993.  His parents report that he- What the hell?  Another one? *(A pause, followed by a deep intake of breath.)* Patients parents report matches with previous patients, Max displays impossible knowledge and newly antisocial behavior.  I'm guessing this appointment will be cut short as well."

*(The recorder is set down, though it's fumbled a bit, and the sound of it hitting the table is louder than previous recordings.)*

SANDS: "Please send Max in."    
NURSE: "Yes, Doctor."    
*(The door opens, shuts, and creeps open, and is shut softly.)*    
SANDS: "Hello Max.  Please have- are you alright?"    
PIETERSON: *(Slowly, robotically.)* "Earnie doesn't like you."    
SANDS: "Max?  What are you doing?  Put that d-"    
####BANG!    
SANDS: *"Urk."*    
*(The door bangs open.)*    
NURSE: "Doctor, are you alright? I thought-"    
*(The nurse's voice cuts off as she screams.)*    
####BANG!    
PIETERSON: "Earnie doesn't like eavesdroppers either."    
###BANG!
