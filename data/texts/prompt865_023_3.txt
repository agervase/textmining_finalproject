Though darkness surrounds me, It's not really my thing,


Honestly? Ruler of the Frost? I never wanted to be King,


But no matter what my old dreams were,


This power within me has started to stir,


I just wanted a girlfriend, and to own my car,


Maybe my ambitions wouldn't have gotten me far,


But damn it, they were mine, before all this came about,


Hmmm, let's see, my first memory? It's all confusion and shouts,


I was in a gas station I think, and it was incredibly hot,


I had wandered in for a drink, And was shortly caught,


Trying to down a second cherry ICEE,


The guy ran over and tried to stop me,


Before I knew it he was screaming in pain,


I could practically feel the ice in his veins,


Since then maybe it's been a year or two,


I have no idea what I should do,


Anyone that's tried to tell me no,


Seems to freeze colder than snow,


But it's not just telling me no, or so it seems,


It has a mind of it's own, and those it deems,


A threat to us, are all struck down,


Their frozen solid faces frown,


And because it's slow and painful too,


These idiot's threw me on the news,


Now every single hopeful face, 


Never get's to leave this place, 


The bounty placed sure seemed high,


Considering I'd never even tried,


Half of the things they said I did,


I never intended to hurt that kid,


And the police that responded, I was blamed for them,


Although I begged them not move a limb,


I don't control it, I don't think, it's independent of me,


Because even as I sleep, it runs free,


Frozen intruders when I open my eyes,


Freeze faster at night so there are no cries,


No one is stupid enough to stay too near,


They're all worried they'll be frozen in fear,


I guess there is some good to come with the bad,


That was the coldest ICEE I've ever had,


Plus now everything is free,


On account of everyone agreeing with me.
