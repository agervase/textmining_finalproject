Please bear with me. This is my first ever reply. Also I'm not a native speaker. I hope you enjoy regardless.

I stood there. Listening to the clock on the other side of his kitchen. Two big, light green eyes looking left, then right, then left again. synchronous to the ticking noise.  Left-right-left-right. I usually feel sadness whenever the day comes. The one day. The last day. But this time I was genuinely angry. This stupid kitty-cat clock. Grinning down at me with it's stupid, yellow teeth. 

*tick tock tick tock*

I've never seen something as ugly as this. But no matter how much I begged. He refused to throw it away.
"It was a gift by an old friend", he always said. "I have it for a long time now. I'm not throwing it away just because you don't like it." It wasn't that I didn't like it. I hated it.

I felt my hand reach behind me. Slowly trying to find what it was looking for.

"Oh come on. There are worse things in this world than this! What about that old carpet at your place? I never complain about that stinky rug." We had a bad fight that day. Our first big one. But it didn't matter. I still love this man. I might be angry but I still love him. Sadly.

As my hand slowly pulls open the cupboard it was searching for, all the anger I had suddenly washed away. My head grew heavy and my vision went blurry as tears started to form in my eyes.

The kitchen door swung open and brown, dirty boots stepped on the tiles. Splashing mud wherever they touched the ground.

"Man what a storm." Henry said as if everything was okay. It wasn't.

"I had to drive to three different stores. The first was closed, the second had noch salsa and the third no Nachos! Can you believe that?"

"I'm sorry Henry." I whispered while my hand firmly grabbed something smooth and cold. I couldn't help it. I stopped resisting a long time ago. Long before Henry and I even met at that old hotel in cologne. It realy was a weird coincidence. Both Henry's and my parents are from germany. And we both live in Ettrick, Scotland. A small village with around 100 people. Maybe a little more. We've never seen each other before. And yet we found each other in a hotel 800km from where we both lived.

"Why? Did you steal all their friday evening supplies?" He chuckled.

I raised my arm infront of my chest. My heart was pounding and my breathing was heavy. The big kitchen knife reflected the light of the single lightbulb that dangled from the ceiling. Cobweb swung in the almost not noticeable draft that came through the poorly isolated windows.

"And now you want to stab me, because I found out." he joked and smiled. "But I have to warn you. I'm not that easy to defeat."

"I'm so sorry Henry. I have to. I can't stop it. You can't stop it."

"I don't have to."

*tick tock tick tock*

I made two slow steps towards him. The knife still raised. The stainless steel still reflecting the light. The clock still ticking.

"I love you." I said as I made the last step towards him and burried the blade deep into his heart. 

*tick-*

It was quiet. Tears ran over my face. Down to my nose. Collecting at the tip and dropping down towards the ground. Before reaching it, they froze. Seemingly hovering in the air.

"Kate?"

Something was off. Something that shouldn't be. The world had stopped. As if it suddenly, after billions of years, had decided that spinning was just too exhausting and it needed a break. I looked up. What I saw filled me with fear and confusion at the same time. It was Henry. And it was not. His eyes were red and glowing. As if they were made of fire. His face had wrinkles and scars and lost all color. The knife in my hand was gone. As if it never existed. Henry opened his mouth. What I heard was not his voice. Not alone. It were millions and billions of voices. Of men, women and some didn't even sound human.

"Kate."

I opened my mouth to scream. But no sound escaped my throat.

"I think we just created a paradox."
