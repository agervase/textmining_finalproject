As she watched the sun rise, her phone rang. 

"Elizabeth! Happy birthday, baby girl," her mother's voice chimed from the speaker. "Twenty one already! It seems like just yesterday you were running around in your little outfits pretending to fight all the bad guys out there."

The cars below were sounding their horns, impatient for their morning commute to be over.

"I know, mom. Thanks for calling. You know we don't have long. I just wanted to see how everyone was... are you safe?"

The smells of the early morning city assaulted her from her perch. It was strange thinking how long it had been since she had seen  her mother. What was it, ten years? Oh how it had all changed.

"You know the rule mom, sixty seconds. Anything you need to talk about before this is over?" "Well, I got a package in the mail for you today. I don't know how it didn't get forwarded to the agency, but I have it. No address, just your name weird. Do you want me to send it off? It's quite small."

A small package. That was new. Officially, she was dead. Nobody should be sending her anything. It couldn't hurt though.

"Yeah, mom. Go ahead and send it. Time is up. Ill get the new number and time to you in a few weeks. Love you." "Okay, baby girl, love you too.! Keep up the good work. We are so proud you were chosen, and just want you to be safe."

Elizabeth turned the phone off and set it down. As she got up to leave, she could already see a commotion a few blocks down. They were coming for her, and she needed to leave. She made her way in the opposite direction, and thought of what had led her to this moment.

*Ten years ago, early morning before her birthday party, the two men had shown up. They didn't look out of the ordinary, they came in and asked to speak with her parents. It was hard for her to hear what they were saying, but Elizabeth heard her mother crying, and her father trying to comfort her. When everyone came back inside, Elizabeth tried to look like she hadn't been watching. "Lizzy, dear, these men have a special present for you. They have come to take you to a new school, where you can learn all sorts of new interesting things." This had to do with what had happened. Elizabeth swore she didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. That boy just fell, that's all.*

*She was right. It did have to do with that. The men had taken her to the most intimidating building she could have imagined as a child. The cold, grey fence rose like a force field, blocking away all of the light from the outside. Elizabeth stepped out of the car to see her new home. The men were silent as the guided her inside, just as they  had on the car ride. There she saw thirty or more children, all the same age as her, each being guided by two incredibly ordinary looking men. *

**"Welcome to the Agency"** announced the woman at the front of the assembly. **Your new home.**

*Six months into her training, Elizabeth had been joking with some of her dorm mates. They had been learning new techniques, and the secrets of chain reactions. "If I had a nickel for every person I've killed, I would be **rich**" Elizabeth joked with her friends. That is what they had been training for, anyhow. How to get away with murder.*

Several weeks later, Elizabeth was climbing the steps to the old grey manor she had called home for almost half of her life. Her friends had come and gone, and now she was one of three students left from her first year class. Margaret met her at the door. 

"Welcome back, Elizabeth. Were you successful?"
 "Three targeted kills, and a successful ripple, Ma'am." 
"Very good. You have mail from your mother. Its quite small for your annual care package, but if my records are correct, she hasn't sent you anything for years, anyhow." 
"I told her you provided everything I need. It must be for my birthday. Since it is a milestone year for most people."
"Well, it is sitting in your bunk. Be prompt for mealtime, we have a new assignment for you tonight, should be a short one."
"Yes, Ma'am."

Elizabeth climbed down to her level. Being one of the oldest Associates at the Agency afforded her a room to herself. Not many people had survived as long as she did, especially without getting caught. Laws still applied to the Associates, but only if law enforcement could prove it, and catch them.

As she got to her bunk, Elizabeth opened the door. Everything was exactly as she had left it, but for a small wrapped parcel on her desk. It was wrapped in twine, and scrawled in a childish script was her name: "Lizzy." She deliberately undid the twine, and unfolded the crinkled brown paper. Inside was a small box, containing an unassuming key, with an address. Remembering her orders for a punctual dinner appearance, Elizabeth shoved the key into her uniform. She glanced in the mirror to straighten her appearance, and left the room, leaving the wrappings where they lay.

After dinner, Elizabeth left the manor again, on her way to complete her assignment. She was to set up a life in the neighboring state, enroll in classes at the local community college, and await the rest of her orders. Listening to her orders, she realized that the address with the key had been in that same town. It couldn't hurt to see what it was about. Obviously, someone had gone to a lot of trouble to get it to her, and somehow, Elizabeth felt it was important.

The stuffy man looked her up and down, as Elizabeth waited patiently in the bank lobby. "May I... help you?" he said, looking down his nose in antipathy. 

"I have a key. It was given to me with this address, I assumed you would know what it was for?"
"Well, bring it here. I will need to see I.D. It is protocol."

Grateful for the Agency's thorough manner, Elizabeth dug out her current driver's license. 

"Alicia Abernathy?" the man questioned, a look of skepticism behind his stale visage. 
"That's my name," offered Elizabeth in return.
"Well, follow me, I suppose. There is no Alicia on the registry, but the note says as long as you have the key..."

Inside the large vault was an unexpected quantity of nickels. Nickels? Elizabeth abruptly turned to the man.

"What kind of joke is this?" she demanded.
"No joke, but this letter was to be given to you with it."

Elizabeth snatched the envelope he offered, as he walked away.

*Lizzy, looks like you were right. If you had a nickel for every person, you would be rich. $550,000 is a lot of money. You were always much better than me. I hope you realize that some day, your life can be your own, and you don't have to always follow the path you are pointed down. Or you may end up on the end of it.*

The note was not signed, but scrawled in the same childish writing that the package had been written in. 

Elizabeth's breath caught in her throat. She had never quantified what she had done, but she couldn't believe that this was what she had spent her life doing. 

A single nickel rolled out in front of her, and she picked it up. Tears welled in her eyes. *He fell, I swear it. He just fell.*
