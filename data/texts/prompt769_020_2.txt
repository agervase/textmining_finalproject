 
There was nothing but cell and chair. 
The cell was the mottled, bleached white of sun-faded bone. The cell the same save for me and my chains, also of bone, which held me fast without movement, and without sound, and without touch. I could only see and the white howled at me with it's impossible, unceasing uniformity.

"Let me out! Let me out!" I tried yelling. Nothing would come out. I only ticked a tiny, imperceptible step closer to insanity.


**********

After some decades the TV came.

It began to play my life and I was thrilled. It wasn't white  firstly and secondly I'd lived ninety years. Ninety was finite. I could endure. I must endure!


They gods were merciful.



*******

A year later I noticed the comments. They'd been thte before of course but I'd blocked then out till now as I feasted on the rich colors which has blessed my life. They were a running commentary on my actions from, well it seemed everybody I'd ever effected. I wasn't too displeased. Whatever their words, good or ill, they would still be finite. I would escape.


"Hell's Youtube comments," I thought. " *How charming.* "


********

The comments were vile and vicious and howling with madness. My life lay before me as a sharp, cruel, wicked instrument that I'd inflicted on all these other lives. My sanity began to shred as the words cut into me how cruel and wicked I was.  How cruel and wicked, we all were. 


********

I wasn't mad.


I think.

It had stopped. 

"You may comment now."

"On what? How? Why?" I wished to say. Still sound was forbidden to me.


And then my video began again and this time I could tell everybody else how they has effected me as we had interacted. So that's the trick a spark within me thought. They'd done this for everybody, creating their own twisted reflection of life from our howling, vengeful fury.


I could survive this!


"Except why bother?" my insanity asked. "Nobody else did so."


"It seems--" 

But what did it seem?

My spark was no more. The effort to remain too high. It seemed ludicrous to answer "right" in a world so "wrong". 
I didn't even think this was about me.


"Finally," consoled insane me. "Acceptance."

 
And so I accepted. I began to howl and rant providing Hell with it's grim, unfathomable entertainment.
