"And in exchange for this power, I want one of your organs." The demon was smiling, it was pretty sure I'd take the offer impulsively. Dumbass.  

"Okay, but only non-essential organs, I don't want to die fifteen seconds after recieving these abilities." I was pretty sure I knew what was coming next.

"Okay, I will take one non-essential organ from your personage. Do we have a de-" 

"Oh, and it has to be internal." I cut him off, this should hopefully surprise him enough to work in my favour, "After all, _skin_ is an organ, is it not? I don't particularly want to live without my skin. If it makes your life easier, I have a contract drawn up that covers all the unsavoury loopholes." I pass it the paper, smugness exuding from me. 

"And why would I sign this?" It said, "I see no benefit to me. Why don't I just leave?"

"Your scare tactics won't work on me, I've done my homework. I know that if you return without having made a deal, you'll be punished for eternity." The colour drained from its face, apparently people don't ever think of making vague, accurate threats. 

"And if I sign this, I still get an organ?" He seemed worried, he really should be. 

"Absolutely" I reply, smiling my sincerest smile, "That's what was offered was it not?"

The beast clicks it's fingers and vanishes in a puff off smoke. I wonder how he'll be treated after he realises he not only removed my appendix, but that I had appendicitis. What a win for humanity, free surgery _and_ the power to optionally never sleep again, but always feel well rested. Oh, and I hope he notices his new tattoo before anyone else, a demon of all things should learn to read the fine print.
