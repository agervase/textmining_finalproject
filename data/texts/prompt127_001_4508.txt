Whenever I wake up in the morning, I always make sure to stretch my hands and let out a big, bright smile. After all, it is a new day to look forward to. And that means looking forward to more charitable work and acts of kindness; to better the community around us, don't you think? I think so. So does the rest of the city. And of course, the newspaper clippings hanging on my wall confirm just that.

**Local Woman From Belleview County Writes Veterans 2,000 Letters**

**22-Year Old Social Worker Buys 100 Coffees For Homeless Shelters**

"Ah, such bliss..." I said as I danced around in the white-walled bedroom, jumping from article to article that covers every act I did to give back to the community. "To know what impact you're making," I thought to myself as I stretched my back one last time.

"It really motivates me every day."

I promptly exited my bedroom and quickly went about my morning routine. Brushing my teeth, having a warm shower, and a good breakfast really can go by quickly when your mind is dead set on the activities of the day. As I waited for my toast to pop up, I whipped out my phone and pulled up my calendar to see what I have scheduled for today.

"So I guess after I pay Mrs. Grimly a visit, I'll have my soup kitchen session up at Sunshine Street." I muttered softly as I sipped my coffee; the strong aroma making sure I can digest all the information for the day. "Leave early to hardware. Get 20 lattés for knitting session. Lock door before exiting. Buy chocolates for Jordan." Her sticky notes may be messy and all over the place, but that's the system of kind soul Jane Goldenheart.

"Alrighty!" I said as I put the dishes into the dishwasher and grabbed my new backpack. It was a gift from the charity organization I volunteered at on Sundays to acknowledge exceeding our fundraiser goals. I smiled at the shiny new pink decals I put up as I locked the door and promptly walked out the front door, making sure to lock that too. Greeted by the morning sun, I looked up and gave it a great big smile,

"Today's gonna be a new day." I thought as my heart fluttered a little bit.

Bustling and busy as she may be, Jane Goldenheart always stays true to her name. Every person in the town knows me, and likewise, so do I! From the oldest of grandmothers to the shyest of panhandlers, nobody was a stranger to me in this here town. As I walk down the street, I wave to every passerby. "Hello Mr. and Mrs. Todd, fine day today for Timmy to play at the park! Why hello, Margaret. I hope you remembered to water your flowers. Little Caroline, here's a gumdrop for you." Most of them responded to me with smiles and laughter.

"I know what you did, witch."

The hoarse croak came from the alleyway. Turning to her left, I saw her: Vera Truclam. Even though she was covered in black rags and soot, I always do my best to give her a smile and a cordial hello. But of course, she would only spit at me and shoo me away.

"Why hello, Ms. Truclam!" I said nervously as I scratched the back of my head. "A fine morning to y-"

"Oh can it Blackheart!" She replied roughly as she shuffled her makeshift blanket around on the dirty alley road. "Don't try to get me under your façade too, witch." She gave me an evil glare that made me uncomfortable.

"Well it was nice talking to you!" I said as I tried to wrap things up quickly, extending out my hand to her. But of course, she only slapped me and waved her black cloth at me to shoo me away. I didn't look back when I walked away. "She was always like that ever since her little Wally disappeared," I thought to myself as I frowned, "But I hope she feels better!" I exclaimed to cheer myself up. Can't go around with a sad-looking day when my job is to brighten it!

As I went through the day, I worked really hard in all my duties; always giving it a 110%. And the results always show! Mrs. Grimly smiled and gave me a rose. The kids at the daycare all waved at me and called me "pretty Ms. Sunshine." Lolly was grateful and offered me a discount on my next visit to the confectionary store. It was a wonderful day, and it was only going to get even better.

"You know you don't have to do this, Jane." My best friend Lily said as she smiled at me; her fingers meticulously working on a smaller beanie. "I know how busy you are and how tired you must be." The other some 6 women nodded in agreement.

"Oh, but this is my first time knitting for the St. Mary's Children's Choir!" I refuted with a cheeky grin. "Not even that. It's my first time knitting altogether, so I think it's a good place to start." I comically giggled as I held up my tangled needles and thread. The other women just laughed as Lily helped me out.

"Ok, so just insert it here...ooh not too fast!" Lily instructed me as she pointed and prodded at the needles. "Put this under here, not there! Ok Jane just make sure it enters that loop. Oh! Crap!"

Lily had accidentally pushed on my elbow, causing the right needle to prick my left finger. My brain didn't hesitate what to do. Like clockwork, I immediately overreacted and clutched my entire left hand; tears springing into my eyes. Lily just gasped as she stood up.

"Oh my goodness I'm so sorry Jane! Here let me look!" She exclaimed as the other women scrambled for tissues or bandages.

"NO!" I said with a panicked tone. "I'm fine!" I assured them as I stood up quickly and scanned the room for my bag. "It's just some blood, no biggie." I smiled forcefully; my nervous hand putting pressure on the wound. It felt oozy.

"At least let me drive you home..." Lily offered as the women, now armed with the pure white tissues, tried to find drips of the blood on the hardwood floor. Nervous, I made sure to inspect each and every one of them with my eyes so nobody notices what is happening.

"Clear blood must be nice..." One of them said as she tried to feel around the location where my blood should have dripped. "I can't even see it!" Another one exclaimed. "But that's expected of our Jane."

"Ok well, it's sad but it's just an accident." I strained a smile as I started to back into the door. "Thank you everyone and I hope to finish these beanies before next Sunday. Have a good evening ladies. " I slammed the door open and practically ran back; ignoring the calls of "Jane wait!" and "Are you sure dear?"

"This can't be happening." I huffed and puffed as I looked down at my right hand cupping my left, the black liquid starting to pool. "This can't be happening." The opacity stared back at me. "This cant be happening this cant beh appening thisca nt behap pening thiscan tbehap pening thiscantbehappening thiscantbehappeningthiscantbehappeningthiscantbehappening."

I practically opened and slammed my front door, my back against it as I started heaving. My mind is a flurry as I scanned my house for any possible intruders or forced points of entry. "Looks like the neighbors aren't peeping in." I internally reassured myself as I glanced back at the oozing black blood from my middle finger.

"Just to be safe..." I muttered as I marched to the pantry door and swung it open, revealing a metal door with an electronic passcode handle. Pressing it sloppily, my mind is hazy as I laughed and giggled at the events that just transpired. Perfect Jane found to be black-blooded criminal? Belleview woman guilty of murder and kidnapping? Social worker fools entire town with her façade?"

"WALLY!" I shouted as I descended the dimly lit stone stairs. Maintenance is not a priority when you're building a dungeon. Anger flowing my veins, I picked up a baseball bat as I saw the fearful glowing stares of 4 children. Brandishing the black-covered bat, I can only feel my heart coagulating and my mask cracking.
