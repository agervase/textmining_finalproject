The Doctors’ Strike in 2002 was an event that had defined Relses City for years to come.

It was a cloudy Thursday with most of the doctors gathered around on a small stand. They were donned with gas masks, pale white overcoats, and they had their phones in their hands. The sound coming from the phones was in unison and said only one phrase in a robotic voice: “Absolute Justice”.

It was for their fallen comrade who was shot two days prior. In the last three months alone, there were twenty-five shootings—with fifteen of them including elephant guns—ten stabbings and two all out brawls. And doctors thought it was time.

On their march to the parliament building nestled on the city center, they were unaware of the snipers peering at them behind the curtains of eleven apartments.

The doctors had started walking in a staccato fashion, with each chant denoting a stop. On the end of their march, one man dressed in hunter green overcoat and a grey woolly hat came forward read:

The sentence didn’t continue. One of the men positioned at the windows had fired his suppressed assault rifle, taking the man’s head in one clean shot. The doctors weren’t panicked, they kept doing the motion of walking, as if they were continuing their march. The “Absolute Justice” chant was now blaring, enhancing the ensuing toppling and jostling of people around them.

For reasons nobody was able to discern, doctors were untouchable now. The bullets were hitting them, pellet after pellet falling to the ground, but they didn't flinch.

Atop one of the buildings a man was giggling to himself. “You are too late,” he said under his breath. It was Doctor Vamdeign who was also known as the sullen man, death’s face, or the last resort.

“From now on, mafia will get what it wants, along with everybody else,” he said solemnly, before vanishing into thin air without a trace.
