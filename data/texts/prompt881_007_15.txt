“Please kill this man,” said the man in the black suit holding the photo up. “I know you can.”


“But, I’m just a kid. The only time I’ve killed happened seven years ago,” I told him.

His emotionless face remained the same. He took out a some dollar bills. I picked up the money and examined it from every angle. They looked real and felt real. No doubt about it: these were legitimate dollar bills from the year 2020.  These things were worth a fortune since they from before the war that occurred in Washington, D. C. 


I slid the money back across the coffee table. 


“I’m sorry, I can’t,” I said.


Mr. Gold’s was face no longer blank. It was filled with frustration. I saw something blue glowing on his neck. It must’ve been a sage implant to keep his emotions in check. Clearly it must have broken because of the frustration he was having.


“What would it take then?” he screamed.

“Take it easy, man,” I told him. “The reason I don’t kill is because I don’t want people to experience what I had when I killed Xander that dog: the loss of somebody you loved. Plus it was an accident.”


And with that, he stormed out of the room. 

“Keep the cash, maybe you’ll change your mind next time,” he said.


Mr. Gold wasn’t the first person to ask me to kill someone. I’ve gotten hundreds of requests on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, and the list goes on. I can’t go on one website website someone asking, “Hey can you kill so and so?” My answer is always, “No, I can’t.”


People expect me to be some kind of god of death or something, but, really, I’m not. If you ever met me, please don’t ask me to kill someone. It’s hard enough already.
