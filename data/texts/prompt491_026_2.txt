## THE END OF DAYS
The pain was unbearable. Obviously. We all know that breaking a bone hurts, but breaking every bone in your body... that really hurts. 

So Death was met with an unusually warm welcome when his twisted and skeletal form manifested itself in front of Kevin. 

"Oh thank God you're here! Take me, please! End this suffering!"

Death loomed large over Kevin's mangled body. His scythe twinkling as it caught the sun, as though passively destroying photons to kill time while it waited to cut down the life of more complex material. Death leaned forward, his hood casting just enough shadow to hide his empty eyes, but not enough to mask his perpetual, toothy grin. Kevin closed his eye's, accepting his fate and eager to feel the sweet release of death...

"ERM, ABOUT THAT..."

Said Death. 

## TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER

"WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?" Asked death. 

Kevin had never seen a more beautiful woman. Her wide eyes as blue as a mountain lake. Her skin as smooth and white as the finest porcelain. The tattered an worn cloth struggling to contain her heaving bosom. *she's perfect* he thought. A sexual desire the likes of which he'd never felt swelled up inside of him so strong he almost ejaculated in his pants at the mere sight of here.

"Naaaaaah" said Kevin. 

"I DON'T UNDERSTAND" exclaimed Death. "IS SHE NOT EVERYTHING YOU REQUIRE?"

"Weeeeeeell, Not really." Kevin replied. 

"BUT SHE HAS WIDE EYE'S OF A BLUE THAT YOU FIND IN A MOUNTAIN LAKE!" Said death. "AND I'VE COMPARED HER SKIN TO THE FINEST CHINA AND IT LOOKS INDISTINGUISHABLE TO ME. AND HER BOSOM IS MOST DEFINITLY HEAVING!"

"Yeah. But look at her ankles"

"WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER ANKELS?" 

"Yeah, what's wrong with my ankles?" Asked the most beautiful woman in the world. 

"They're not child bearing ankles. If we're gonna restart the human race, we're gonna need to make a lot of kids. And those ankles, by my estimate, can handle one, two pregnancies at most. She's great and all, but we need one with better ankles."

"FAIR ENOUGH"

And death cut her down. 

"Well that's a shame. I really can't wait to father a couple of kids so you can take my soul. I just wish we could get this whole 'being alive' thing over with. You know?"

"I KNOW" said Death. 

"Cool", said Kevin. "Well I'll be right here in the mansion practicing on those instructional doll we found. So when you find another real woman, just come knocking. Ok?"

"OK" said Death. 

"Sweet. L8rs" said Kevin.
