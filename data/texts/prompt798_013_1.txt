I’m not sure if it was a curse or a blessing. A few months back, I went to an old tea shop in Peru. The woman who worked there told me of these ancient ruins not far from the city limits. I decided to check them out, only to find a glowing tablet with some indecipherable text on it. Being the curious guy I am, I pick up the tablet and look at it, the glowing goes away and I’m left wondering why this was worth my time.

Fast forward 2 months. I’m about to go into a business meeting and I can’t seem to rid myself of this cold. As I enter, I sneeze with a noise like “kerchphloo” and out of no where, a pen appears. Not sure why, but I think my cold I’m making me hallucinate. As I enter the business meeting, I get a flashback to the tablet I held in Peru. Perhaps that’s why the pen appeared?

3 months later, I’m going on a train and the guy in front of me has a very large cane. As we board the train, the man accidentally hits me in the nose with his cane and I yell, “wrapthaga” in pain. And like the pen, a carrot appears. Just an ordinary carrot, out of no where. I think that tablet really did give me this power.

Just a week later, I’m blaring random noises to try and make things appear. I’m at this point going full gibberish and go “kemaldphlapango” and a cow appears. I’m convinced that this power is garbage, I can possibly remember Kermit whatever.

Less than 2 months later, I come down with another cold. While coughing, I don’t know what I said, but it must’ve been good. Because a glowing green tablet appeared in my hands when I made a strange cough. As the light fades from the tablet I thing to myself. Here we go again.
