“TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY” his voice, so happily played through my head like a bad memory, and I knew his excitement was way more than mine. How could I forget the day? The day I say goodbye to my life to fulfill a commitment. My mind only repeated the sound of his voice over and over to the point of no sleep. 
I looked over at the clock, a red glow of blurry numbers - they looked foreign due to sleep deprivation. 3:46 I STILL HAVE A FEW HOURS my head rushed. 
”Please don’t get up,” my wife groaned in her half-hearted, sleepy voice. She never knew, and it was about to hit her like a train. I got up anyway. “TODAY IS THE BIG DAY” he spoke, as if he told me from the air, and I hoped it was just the tired thoughts, but he was there. “Yeah, about that…” I began, with fear that filled my body up from my toes. I gave a sigh to just let me feel free again, but I was trapped in my own body, it seemed. “…I don’t think I can do this. My wife is in there, and she can’t be the one to witness this.” My voice then cracked as my mind rushed into what felt like a million miles per hour. My wife, was pregnant, and almost full term, this couldn’t be healthy. What are my parents going to think? I thought I had so much more to live for. 
“YOU AGREED!” he, the demon I feared and loved, shouted; he took over my mind with his words. He wasn’t going to let me escape.
I looked over my shoulder to my wife, and I adored her for the last time. The clock was now 6:59, and I knew that it was time. I looked at the demon, sweat filled my face as tears filled my eyes. My toes went numb, and it felt like forever as the rest of my body followed.
The gunshot was the last thing I heard, and the first thing my wife heard that morning. 
“I’m so glad to have you here,” my demon said, so calm. I awaited the afterlife commitment with a passive anxiety, but at least I was committed to a friend.
