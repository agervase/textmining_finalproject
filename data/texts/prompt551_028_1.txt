Flipping Fireweeds.


We marched together in a strange harmony.  It was a neutral beat, something out of the normal, but familiar.  I distinctly remember my old fifth grade teacher trying to get my class out of the room out to a hike.  Once we had vanished from the urban scene and arrived onto the green trail, it was much like this. People chatted idly to pass the time, occasionally looking around to see red and blue sprouts on the ground.  


Opening up to an open field, we filed in and spread out quickly.  Death found a seat and brought out a sharpening stone.  The scythe made a piercing noise through the chatter.  With each stroke, the chatter grew louder.  Some around him tried to ask questions but faced a solemn skull.  It was hard to tell Death's emotions from that alone.  


From afar, his cloak appeared flimsy.  But as you approached him, it gave a wave of strength, something of intimidation.  It knew you were afraid and the cloak soaked in some of your color, paling your skin.  It was a terrible thing to experience.  


Death looked up mid stroke, watching me stare at him from afar.  The eye sockets gazed into my mind, I felt the cloak chill my shirt.  I thought it had dried of the blood from the car accident, but I felt as if I was right there again. Almost as if....

*Johnny! Jesus Christ, do something for him!*


*Ma'am, please stand back. Give them room to work. Chow! Get an arm on her, there are two others in the car.*


*He's bleeding, oh God I can't watch. Why, why Johnny?!*

I blinked.  Death was focused back on sharpening the scythe.  Everyone around was still talking about their lives with their new stranger friends.  People sitting or lying down, even a few found themselves napping. 


Death stood, looking behind me.  There was someone in the weeds.  The blue and red cover them beautifully.  Death only pointed.  As he did, the weed grew to a sudden burn, a brilliant flash of fire.  The person had vanished.  


Everyone heard the next moment only in thought. 


*Do not dread death. Dread losing your soul.*
