And all at once I fell flat on my face. My boots had tried to turn and run, whilst my sword pulled my arm forward causing me to hang suspended momentarily horizontal before slamming spectacularly into the ground with a wind releasing "Oof!"

&#x200B;

"Way to go, dick-ass!" My spellbook said, its voice coming muffled from inside my pack, speaking with that maddening sense of superiority. "I told you we should've fired a blasting spell at him. Now look at you, sprawled on the ground like a novice pupil whose robes haven't yet obtained a single singe or tear."

&#x200B;

"Can it, you leathery old shit!" I said as I stood up and regained my grip on my sword and shield.

&#x200B;

"At least I'm not spineless..." the book muttered, cheekily.

&#x200B;

"And you," I said, my voice rising as I looked down at my boots, "do that again, and I'll chop you off and toss you into a volcano. I don't need feet if I can perform a floating spell." The boots squeezed my feet with a gentle hug in an apologetic fashion.

&#x200B;

"Now, did anyone see which way he went?"

&#x200B;

My shield spoke up. "I believe he took the tunnel to the right, sire." I ran forward cautiously and, creeping up to the tunnel's mouth, I peeked my head around the corner that opened onto a dark passageway that led off the main chamber of the cave.

&#x200B;

Not only had we come here on bad advice and against all counsel, but this wasn't the first mage that we had encountered here. We had already found three dead in the tunnel leading to the chamber in which we were now crouched, listening for the sound of distant footsteps.

&#x200B;

"We really ought to turn back." the shield suggested with obvious dread in its voice.

&#x200B;

"Oh, of course *you* want to turn back," the sword chided. "You're made of wood." The mage had indeed just shot a fire charge at us only seconds before our embarrassing fall moments ago.

&#x200B;

"It's not just that-" the shield countered, defensively.

&#x200B;

"Both of you, shut it!" I ordered in a loud whisper. "We're going in after him. He could have the shard, after all."

The shard was one of five, that together would re-create the Amulet of Portals, the incantation for which my spellbook assured me he knew. I crept slowly forward around the corner and we started down the tunnel. I felt my boots tighten against my feet again, making them quiver with each step I took.

"Relax," I assured them, "I don't hear anything."

&#x200B;

"But he could be right up ahead!" my shield warned.

&#x200B;

"Using a cloaking spell too." continued my boots.

&#x200B;

"You two are such fuckin' cowards." muttered the spellbook.

&#x200B;

"Be nice." I told the book. "And keep quiet, all of you. I think I hear something."

&#x200B;

We had made it maybe a hundred feet down the tunnel so far, encountering no other intersections, but I could definitely hear a faint scraping noise that sounded like metal on stone.

&#x200B;

"What's the plan, sire?" asked the shield.

&#x200B;

"I'm ready for battle!" the sword whispered loudly.

&#x200B;

"I'm telling you once more, you are going to need me for this." the spellbook warned.

&#x200B;

"Alright!" I said impatiently, coming to a halt and crouching down near the tunnel's left wall. "Why exactly are we going to need you? I do not know any attack spells yet, and the only thing you've assured me of so far is that you can repair the Amulet. What good would you be, held in my hand, if I can't cast spells?"

&#x200B;

"Because, you ignorant excuse for a wizard, I am no mere tome of enchantments!"

&#x200B;

"Oh, do tell!" mocked the sword, putting on a high-pitched voice. "Please, tell us all of your many adventures slaying mages and the undead. What do you do? Flap your covers at them and blow dust in their eyes?"

&#x200B;

"Enough!" I barked. "You are going to be the death of us all if you don't work together. Now cut the shit and tell me what you know."

&#x200B;

"Do you think that I have not shown you many of my pages out of mere secrecy? Do you not think that I would gladly share with you the contents hidden within if it were in my power to do so? I am a spellbook, yes, but in more ways than one. There are spells that I can show you, written across my pages, and there are spells that you can use on me..."

&#x200B;

"Explain."

&#x200B;

"My former masters enchanted me with very specific abilities that emanate directly from certain pages within me. If you were to cast me out among your foes and say the correct incantation, I can open my pages and blast them into oblivion, leaving nothing but dust and ash. If you were to lay me upon a table of obsidian and chant the chorus of reawakening, I could open and show you ghosts of ages past."

&#x200B;

I stood there, transfixed by the book's words, at a complete loss for what to say.

&#x200B;

"Now, my very young student, release me from this canvas prison at once. You may leave the shield behind as one, he clearly does not wish to follow us any further, and two, you will have no need of him with me in your hands."

&#x200B;

"What do you think?" I asked the shield.

&#x200B;

"By all means, take him, sire. I shall await your return with high hopes." the shield concurred with relief.

&#x200B;

"Okay then." I conceded. I laid the shield against the wall and slung the pack down from my shoulder. Opening it, I pulled out the large, leather-bound, red and black tome and stood up, the book in my left hand, the sword in my right.

&#x200B;

"That's more like it." the book said. "Now, hold me by the spine underneath the sword, and lay him across my pages pointing directly in front of you."

&#x200B;

"Alright," I said, doing as the book instructed. "What are you going to do?"

&#x200B;

"I am going to tell you a spell which will send a bolt of cursed lightning down the blade, directly into the heart of this mage up ahead."

&#x200B;

"Oh hell yeah!" the sword whooped with glee. "Now *that's* what I'm talking about! Is it going to make him explode?" he asked with excited malice in his voice.

&#x200B;

"With any luck, yes, as that will make retrieving the shard that much easier, as it is currently concealed within his heart."

&#x200B;

"You two are fucking psychotic!" I told them as I once more began to walk down the tunnel, now as nervous as the boots that were squeezing the life out of my toes as the shield called from behind us, "Good luck! And please do come back! I can't imagine what the academy would do to me if I lost you."

&#x200B;

"Probably splinter him as use him as firewood." muttered the spellbook. The four of us chuckled as a warm light grew before us and we walked toward the fight that would become the beginnings of our fabled destiny.
