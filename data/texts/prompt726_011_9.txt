*First the wolves came.*

I was raised by machines and two hundred terabytes of archive data. My brothers and sisters alike, brewed in a tin can whilst it bombed this rock for a thousand years. Hit it with every hijacked asteroid amassed in its armory and dropped in a fleet of chlorofluorocarbon factories from orbit. No idea how they landed this bucket. I don't recall any detail of my childhood. Everyone was assigned a partner, keeps people in check. Mine told me their earliest memory was about solar panel maintenance. 

*A head got smashed in with a power wrench.*

They loaded this flying bunker with a million frozen embryos but they were rolled out in different stages of the atmospheric condition. First batch was a thousand kids. Although this place was crawling with robots their first priority was an education in maintenance. The designers of this place made sure to manufacture scenarios that required social interaction outside of the lessons. Sometimes there'd be smiles all around. Sometimes they'd just come running back to me, tears in their eyes.

*No warning alarms. Systems couldn't track them. Thermal camouflage? Either way the locals won't be too pleased with this first impression.*

The designers of this rusty old lunchbox changed something in us. In all of us. They altered our DNA, made us smarter, stronger and live longer than our ancestors. Eliminated the likelihood of disease or disability. But that didn't help when it came it the Outside. Although it would still be decades, eventually we would have to venture out there. Resources on the inside were not infinite. Although there were teams assigned to reconnaissance, there was still so much we didn't know about the wildlife out there. 

*I take a hit. It's bad. I can barely walk.*

The years go by. They grow up so fast. They started telling me about where we came from. The data on the old world. There was once so many of us. They sent us so long ago. Yet if you aimed a telescope their way there were no lights in that inky blackness. Maybe we were floating down here so long they all died out long ago. Maybe more of us are on the way. Maybe we're supposed to get back up there and help them. Maybe they don't want us to turn back. Maybe we're all that's left.

*I ain't got long partner. Maybe I was assigned to you teach you about loss. Who fuckin' knows.*

Life on the inside is getting tough. I have my partners back, they have mine. We're approaching a critical stage. The data describes it as a long winter. White fluff, like the clouds fell out of the sky and got stuck all over the place. Can't help but wonder if it tastes any better than the usual meals of grey gloop. Solar panels are obscured. We have to make a run for the nearest Orbital Drop Facility and retrieve a fusion coil. A squad is assembled. These kids are all grown up. My partner is armed up. We don't know what we'll encounter on the outside.

*I try to tend to my wounds. I'm hanging on. Caretakers on the ship are a handy bunch. I'm gonna make it bud.*

The crew drag me inside, spilling a bloody trail behind me. The bots crawling all over me, they're already getting work. I can't help but let the pain vocalize. The squad comforts me. We made it. I think I  will to. My partner wrestles them all off of me and gives me a big hug. Everyone else joins in. It's suffocating but it's nice. This must the family the data was talking about.

*My assignment is the protection of my partner. I do my job, they can do theirs. When they're down, I gotta bring them up. Doesn't usually take took long. They seem to like it when I wag my tail a lot.*
