"You abandoned me. Not once, but twice. You wouldn't help me when I came back. I fought for you, I bled for you, and God help me, I killed for you. You wouldn't even tell me WHY I had to kill people."

"Yeah, sure. You told me what you told everyone in the country. We were protecting freedom. Protecting it from what? Nobody was trying to take our freedom. Then, when I got back, you abandoned me. I needed help and you wouldn't give it. The VA is a joke, but its not their fault, you just wont give them the help they need either."

"Sorry folks, a "support our veterans" sticker only gets you so far, and doesn't help. Sure, it may give you the feel goods, and good for you. I'm glad you can feel good."

"So I had to make it on my own. Unfortunately, I changed. Everything I saw, everything I did, everything I heard, it all just kept playing back in my head. I tried to cope, but it was too much for just me. I drove away the people I loved, I found solace in a bottle. Next thing I knew, I was on the street. It wasn't all bad. I met a lot of people like me. We couldn't really HELP each other, but we could comfort each other."

"Then....when I thought my country couldn't fail me any further, fuck me, you did it AGAIN. Does your hubris know no bounds? You feel like you can just do whatever you want without consequence?"

"I was sitting and eating a sandwich that a nice young woman gave me......she had red hair, and a kind smile. A smile that was full of both understanding....and woeful ignorance. You pulled up in your van, and just took me."

"Nobody noticed."

"Again, you wouldn't tell me WHY I "had" to do this, just that I was "Serving the country". You were abandoning me AGAIN. It has been Ten years since that day. I have seen much, learned more, and fought all. I am here, because I could never abandon YOU."
