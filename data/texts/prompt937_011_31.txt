“So, for the benefit of the court, could you once again just break down what exactly are the limitations of the wishes you offer, as you explained them to my client?”

The genie looked outraged for a second, then just leaned back on his chair, before launching into explanation in his fullest drawl:

“Typical genie rules, nothing to difficult to understand, usually...” He paused, giving the court a smirk.

“Which are, for the benefit of those present who haven’t had the pleasure of doing business with a genie before now?”

The genie sighed dramatically, “no killing, no bringing dead folks or things back to life, no making any one or thing fall in love, and no wishing for more wishes, or things would just get ridiculous.”

The lawyer paced back and forth a few times, staring at the ceiling as though in deep thought.

“And which of these rules do you believe my client has been in breach of?”

The genie scoffed, “obviously the whole wishing for more wishes one. You know that, or why would we even be here. Why do you lawyers always go over every obvious detail, as though it’s going to make it any better for your case by repeating it.”

The lawyer smiled, candidly: “So my client said the words ‘Please Genie, can I please have more wishes’, or did he ask for a specific number of more wishes or..?”

“Well, no. He did wish for more genies though, which is just madness”

The lawyer turned to address the wider courtroom.

“So as the we have all heard, the standard genie rules state that they may not grant a user with any more wishes. However, I do not recall there being any mention of a rule against wishing for more genies?” 

He turned back to the genie, “Or have I misunderstood?”
