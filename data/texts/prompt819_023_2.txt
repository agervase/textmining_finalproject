I wiped the knife, excited by the gurgling sound that Janet made as her limbs twitched involuntarily. I didn’t look back, just walked away. I will stop after this one, I tell myself. This is definitely the last one, besides Ellen has a pass, as far as anyone knows Ellen has killed her one person – and I’m done with the name Ellen, dull dry old Ellen. I throw the knife into the bushes along the footpath. Poor annoying Janet with her condescending smile, her belief in immovable work processes. I vow to never work in an office again.

“Hi, I’m Annette, I’m your new neighbour.” She smiled at me, watching me juggling boxes. She’s a cow. I push my thoughts to something more pleasant. I’ve always wanted to live on the beach. This one will be different, this time I will be my true self. No more hiding, I will pick a name and stick with it until the end of my days. Yes, Emma suits me just fine, I can happily be an Emma. This Emma will get along with everyone. She will settle down, get married and perhaps even become an author, goodness knows she could write a horror story with the ghosts of her past as the main characters…
“You’re awfully quiet, are you seeing anyone? My husband Alan works down the road as a Financial Consultant. We know tons of single guys…Unless you know, you’re more into gals, which is fine too…” 

Annette’s inane ramblings pushed the button that triggered an irritable twitch on my left cheek. I dropped the box, looked up at her and gave her my friendliest voice, I threw in a head tilt to show her my enthusiasm. 

“Why Annette, that sounds simply wonderful, I’d love to meet your friends.” I smiled, perhaps in hindsight, I’m more suited to the name Francesca.
