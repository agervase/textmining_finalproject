“So there’s no cure?” I groan. 
“None. I’m sorry Connie.” He looked down. 

I wince as I lift my wound to my sight. Damn, even I know there ain’t savin’ that. I hear sniffles and eventually low sobbing.  It’s my daughter. Thank goodness she’s okay. My eyes well up. My breathing hastens. 

“Heya, sweetie pie. What’s wrong?” I try to get her stop. 

“Tha-that man said you... were gonna die.” She sniffles. Her big, gleaming eyes were filling up with diamond stones. The corner of her mouth point as downwards as possible. Ahaha... how adorable. 

“No, no, no sweetie. I’m gonna be fine I promise.” I reassure. 

“Buh... he said you weren’t okay.” She says as she wipes her nose. 

“Not right now I’m not. Hey rememberI promised you that I’d take you all over the country didn’t i sweetie? All those wondrous places? Disneyland, Legoland and all that right?” 

“Yeah”

“Well, Connie can’t do that right now okay sweetie?” My snot drips. How unsightly. “Cos you see, Connie is hurt real bad.” 

She breaks into tears again as she sees the bite wound. A wound so vicious that the bone is exposed. She starts wailing. Banging erupts from the door. Growls and roars of the Horde emanates through the unfinished construct of the building. I quickly shush her down. Rob rushes over to the door to barricade it. 

“But don’t worry sweetie, Rob there, is gonna take you to those places instead.” I sniffle. 

“But why? You said you were gonna take me.” She cried. 

“Oh I know. I know.” Dammit, i can’t stop the tears. I smile the very best I can. She did love my smiles. It always perks her right up every morning. I move my hand to wipe her tears but fall short. Damn paralysis. It settles in so quickly. 

“Robbie...” I call him over. He rushes over to me. “I don’t have much time.” 

He nods and starts preparing to leave. Robbie... always the quiet boy. Time you grew up. 
I can feel the blood flowing out of my body, and my consciousness with it.

“Listen sweetstuff. ” What should I even say to her? I’m not qualified for this dad stuff after all Pauline. I need your advice. What would she say? I know. 

“Grow up kind okay? Don’t let nobody tell you who you can and can’t be. Be strong and healthy -” 

“Why are you saying that Daddy? Don’t say that please...” she wails continuously. “Please don’t say goodbye.”

“I’m not, okay? No one is saying goodbye.” I lost my train of thought. 

“Give daddy a hug.” I can’t feel her. Her warmth. Her wet face and snot dripping on my back. 

I make eye contact with Robbie. He pulls her away in one swift motion and dashes towards the construction elevator that leads to ground floor. Fuck! I couldn’t even say goodbye. Shit! Shit! Shit! I don’t wanna go just yet. Not yet please. Not yet.
