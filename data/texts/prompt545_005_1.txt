"Aye, Milord, We'll have the Usurper's keep in a fortnight hence".

Drew signed the letter, placed it in the envelope, poured hot wax on the seal, and stamped his family insignia into the wax. As it cooled, he looked out, past his quiet tent, past the rows of daisies growing on the pitched battlefield, and settled his gaze on the enemy encampment across the field. What on earth could they be up to?

Today, it was soccer, apparently. Thursdays was always a ball sport of some kind. After the truce had been signed in secret months ago, the men had found ways to keep morale up. Soon after the fighting ceased, merchants appeared with all sorts of exotic wares, and the 'battlefield' became a bustling shantytown. All this thanks to some clever negotiations done in secret, between Drew and the usurper's champion, Wryne. Thankfully she had seen the wisdom of Drew's plan, and the two had agreed it would be wiser to simply wait until the king passed away, to prevent bloodshed. The rightful claimant to the throne,  John the III, had become senile in his old age, and he had foolishly left only a single heir, who had perished to the flux a young age. Both captains agreed that with no rightful heirs, the usurper's claim to the throne was as good as anyone's, and while Drew hated the treasonous idea of giving the enemy a victory, he knew that it was the right choice for the kingdom in the long run. 

A ball bounced jauntily into the tent, and nestled comfortably against the canvas lining. There would be no war today, nor any other day, for both sides agreed life was more important than petty feuds. Drew knew that his letter was little more than a boldfaced lie, but his duty was to his men, not the mad king. Not anymore. Not ever again.
