Charlie sipped his coffee slowly as he took in the realization that he was finally free but how free remained to be seen. He knew that it was only a matter of time before Wonka perished but every moment felt like another staggering year of suffrage. Years of child slave labor in the underground candy combs; had taken what was left of his childhood.  How long he thought; would it take for someone to find him? Would they search behind the gumdrops to find the lever that opened the chocolate waterfalls secret entrance? Would they walk down the licorice stair case to discover the candy cane forest; where children were transformed into entrapped ***oompa loompas***? Would they themselves have a little taste of the chocolate lake or the soda pops in their fruitful wonder? 

Oh how Charlie shuddered at the thought. How could he blame them though, he had been fooled as well. They all had! Come to find grandpa was of no use to Wonka, so off to the disposable candies he was sentenced. Murdered and disposed of; the saddest time of Charlies young life. Mother and Father happy as ever with money trickling in from Wonka's factory; assuming their boy was doing well and too busy to visit. No one asked questions as long as cash was exchanged. How easily forgotten Charlie felt during that time; he had become saddened to realize that everyone he loved was either dead or had forgotten him, never once questioning the odd disappearance. 

Every year Wonka held another opportunity at a golden ticket and every year a bunch of dirty, sticky, snot-nosed children fought over the prize. The prize that was used as bait; for more free labor. A prize offered to the poorest of children and the simplest of parents; who'd believe that a secret millionaire would simply offer his riches for free to random strangers.

Separated from his family, Charlie grimaced as he remembered that fateful day; the day that him and his grandpa won the golden ticket and believed too. They saw the rooms, played the games and ate the candies until their tummies caved.  Never realizing that every room was simply a test; a test to be won by Charlie himself.  The others were lucky he supposed, since they made it out alive. Violet was to greedy and problematic to be tamed; Wonka liked his children eager to please. She was simply given a shot and rolled out of the factory. Augustus was too fat and Verruca too loud.  Charlie though was just right, part of a poor family. The silent types never cause issues and his family was the same. It was a perfect match.

Enslaved during the magic flying wonkavator,  Charlies stomach began to curl and burble and bust. Slowly Charlie could feel his features sharpen and his body shorten. While his pain was ghastly , he watched as his grandfather was shoved and thrown out of the elevator and into the chocolate lake that killed him. Unable to save his grandfather Charlies crippling pain came from not only inside but emotionally. Charlie harbored that guilt for many years in these candy combs, reimagining what he should have done or would have done. Had he not wanted better. Had he simply been thankful for what they did have, Grandpa would still be alive.

Nothing takes those moments back; Wonka's slowly poisoned meals does though. Since his eager to please demeanor continued with a secret mission in mind. The mission of getting closer to Wonka in order to gain his trust and poison him on a small yet lengthy scale. Anything too sudden would cause alarm, so Charlie took his time with his plot; in no rush at all. Charlie quite enjoyed watching Wonka slowly suffer before his eyes. Charlie had no cares of being free any longer but to watch Wonka slowly perish before his eyes was reward enough. For all the pain he had caused Charlie and so many more children before him. This was for the ones that were well behaved, easily tamed, silent and fearful. This was for the oompa-loompa's that didn't make it.....
