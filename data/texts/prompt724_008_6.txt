One day, a man was making a cake for his fiancee's birthday, and put on a song to get in the mood to bake. However, singing this song would lead to a very odd encounter.

Man: "Chocolate chocolate, you make feel, chocolate chocolate, so sweet and pure! Chocolate chocolate, I'll wear the ring, so take me to Heaven or Hell I don't care where!"

Demon: "Alrighty then, never had a request like that before."

Man: "Wait, what? That wasn't literal."

Demon: "But you said "take me to Heaven or Hell I don't care.""

Man "That was part of the lyrics to the song I was listening to."

Demon: "I know, I love that song! I visit whenever someone puts it on."

Man: "Well, you have to go! I have to finish this cake, so please leave."

Demon: "But-"

Man: "No buts. You have to go."

Demon: "Aw man..."

Man: "...Alright, look, I'll do this for you. I'll save you a piece of cake after everybody leaves tonight. But after that, you have to leave me alone."

Demon: "Really? Thanks! Most of the time people try to exorcise me, but since you aren't going to do that, I'll listen to you."

Man: "No problem. Now please, you must go."

Demon: "Alright. See you tonight!".

The birthday party went very well. After the man's guests left, the demon came back for his piece of cake.

Demon: "Ooh, it's cake time!"

Man: "They ate a lot more of it than I thought they would, so your piece is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Hope you're okay with that."

Demon: "No problem, I'm just happy I'm getting any at all."

Man: "Well, here you go. Have a nice eternity."

Demon: "And you do that same."

Months after that encounter, the man married his fiancee. They lived happily for many years, and during the final years of the man's life, the demon would check up on him and help him with any problems he came across. All because of that piece of cake.

The end.
