Doing things that you are not supposed to was one of my skills that always got me in trouble. My mother, being a lady of the Night Market, took medicines and herbs so that she could not be with child, but one unfortunate evening I was born nonetheless. I wan't meant to survive in this cruel city on my own after my mom died but I did anyway. People told me I was not supposed to steal but I stole purses from unsuspecting merchants on busiest of streets anyway. People told me I was not to sleep in the alleyways of the city, but I did anyway. However, all these defiance never did me any good. I was alive but hungry. I was asleep but cold. The days went as usual until today when I wasn't supposed to wake up but I did it anyway.

The Medicine is not so expensive, even the lowest of beggars can afford it, and if one begs nicely he will not go without it even in this wrenched town. Sometimes people want to die and don't take it. It is only rarely anyone dies entirely due to lack of The Medicine. But why I didn't take The Medicine yesterday? Well I forgot and not until I went to the market for a new vile and found a full vile in my pocket, I remembered I had forgotten to take it yesterday. I was surprised at first that I had never met a person who ever forgot to take it  but I ran cold when I thought why it was so.

Sitting beside the fountain in town square,  I watched people run here and there full informed of the death creeping inside them, ready to consume them if they forgot to take the medicine. But had anyone tried to see if they can live without it? the question bugged me. People never went far from the city for fear that they will run out of The Medicine. Long distance trade was all but myths. Travelling was death. Until today.
