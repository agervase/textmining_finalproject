In Their ever-growing glory, Those Who Walk Before Us have left another great monument to encourage us on our journey. A great and noble tower, bleached a pure white by the Star, showing Their own passage through this land. Our scouts first spotted it three moons ago, and guided us to it. We know now that we still march on to Salvation, guided by Their ever-present markers. And we have done our part to guide Those Who Walk Behind Us, adding another tier to Their great tower, an inspiration to Those who follow the frozen tundra we leave behind. We will do well to rest here. Our scouts say that the desert is not so distant now, and that we should not expect another oasis to emerge from it for many moons. 

But I am not entirely at rest. We found a smaller monument as well, but it is unlike any that we have seen. It does not depict the great endless plain on which we walk, as all the others do. Instead, it contains a foreign script, and unfamiliar shapes with lines connecting them. It has caused a disturbance among our peoples. Most believe that it was merely a new practice by Those Who Walk Before Us, but there are some who are denouncing it as evil, a work of the darkness that follows behind us. And there are some who say that it bears a message. A message of what, we cannot discern. Myself, I do not know what to believe. I would rather avoid it entirely, but it has become too prominent in my peopleâ€™s minds to ignore.

I'm planning on writing a couple parts from both perspectives, but this is all I have time for now. Will add more soon!

*Edit:* First of all, thank you for the gold, friend! And thank you all for your support and encouragement. I haven't been doing this long, and I'm flattered to get so much support from everyone. I know I haven't been able to reply to everyone, but all of your comments have honestly made my week. So thank you for reading this story, and for being awesome!
