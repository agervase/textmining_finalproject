Chad first noticed it when he was only 13 years old. He was able to simply alter the minds of others to allow him to do what he wanted them to do. He noticed it when he was in line at a Walmart, and he came up 50 cents short. He thought in his mind how he wanted to have that candy bar, and the next thing he knew, the cashier took his money, gave him the candy bar and said have a nice day.  He thought it was a gesture of kindness from the cashier.

As Chad got older, he noticed the powers more. It started when he nearly got into a fight and he just wanted the bully to go and jump out the window... Which he did. Chad watched in fear and guilt as the bully bounced off the concrete from the three story fall. After that, he was incredibly careful with his thoughts. But he couldn't help it. Chad felt the taste of his power, but was always afraid of causing the wrong action. 

So Chad contented himself with simple things. First was to build some money. he simply willed the person who picked the lottery numbers to read his when he called them off. He was set for life. He pursued his own interests while he sat on his money. Using his powers for small things to make his day go smoother. He could make people ignore him as he cut to the front of the line, something he had started doing when he was 18 years old. He had never waited in line again. He was able to meet Celebrities, go through private tours of museums and even cut the line to the Eiffel Tower when he visited France. 

Chad lived a simple quiet life. Knowing full well he could rule the world if he wanted.
