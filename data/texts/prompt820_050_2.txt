"It calls", it called, across the room. As I looked but I didn't see. The one to watch this empty space, the one to hold this place the place that's full of the blades and cuts and swords and Hero's and lords of war. 

I see the light forgotten. From no one it has been seen. I can't be sure but sure I am, if the walls around keep talk they talk. I'm sick inside the voices call, they try to out and see the world. They try escape the ones I know they want leave out on the road. Towards the gift of power for me.

I know it's there I hid it once to keep the rhymes refrained and trained to sink, not swim. A trunk of lead and mould and moss a dampness creeps and creeps of loss. I know it's mine it's called before the ones inside, their wicked grins. A Pen and Pad to write them in though this world is ours in thick and thin or dust or snow or sleet or rain. I can't let them back but the pull is strong I want the rush of freedom from this endless noise.

The great power that's there is not a gift but a curse for me to treat and greet the temptation of me to myself I want, I need to let it give, to let them out and not be in. To let it out and live with me but I know the end I've seen it before, I let out before and the nation's fell, a day a night a plague of rats. The Khan of Khan's and conquerers the kings and queens of thrones and beans.

I reach my hand and feel the cold of lead and moss and wet it folds. I must be strong but I'm not I can't, the years of pain, torment, sleepless months and nights of pain.

I must rest. The Pen returns to paper. It's out, and I can sleep.
