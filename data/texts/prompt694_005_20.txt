I look up from his driver's license to verify the picture matches the man in front on me.

"Should I call you Roger or do you prefer Mr. Kint?"

"Actually, most people just call me Verbal."

I can't tell if he was being sarcastic or not since he hasn't said a word since sitting down and requesting to sign up. I give him a sorta forced smile.

"Ok Roger...I mean Verbal. Here's you ID and key fob. Feel free to use the gym anytime you want. If you're a night owl like me, maybe I'll see you in here at some ungodly hour."

I watch as he stands up and heads to the exit. A car has been idling in front of the gym since he arrived.  Verbal gets in the passenger side and the car speeds off.

Over the next few weeks, I see Verbal occasionally.  He keeps to himself, preferring a treadmill in the back corner of the cardio room.  One of my responsibilities is to clean the machines after use, and I can't help but notice his time and distance.  Impressive to say the least.

Like so many other members, I bump into him at a restaurant on a random weeknight. I am seated a few tables to his left and give him the obligatory wave when we make eye contact.  He immediately looks down at his meal. I notice he is accompanied by a rather rough-looking crew, a boisterous and loud group that maybe he is embarrassed to be seen dining with.

I try not to stare but notice he is struggling to get the fork to his mouth.  His hand is shaking and he looks extremely nervous. And he has a blank look on his face.

*But I just saw him last night.  What gives? Did he have a stroke or something?*

As if feeling my stare, he stands up and begins clumsily approaching me.  *Is he drunk?*

He is limping, and walks past me quickly.  A few minutes later he returns, still limping heavily, so bad in fact that I begin to doubt that it is even him. Directly in front of his table, he bumps into a waitress - seemingly intentionally-  who drops her drink tray, glass shattering everywhere.

One of his cohorts begins laughing inappropriately as he stands up to assist Verbal in sitting back down.

I resist looking back at his table, afraid of embarrassing him, and instead focus on finishing my food with my girlfriend.

After paying the check, I walk by his table and stop, almost involuntarily...

"Verbal? It's me, Timmy... from the Fitness 24.  Did you sprain an ankle or something?"

Forks drop and everyone stares at me.

"Errr... I mean, I saw your time on the treadmill last nigh. Unreal! Are you a marathon runner or something?"

Before he can answer, someone screams "CUT!"

"RELOAD THE G\*DDMAN TRAY WITH GLASSWARE AND EVERYONE GET BACK IN POSITION!  AND SOMEONE CONTROL THAT EFFING EXTRA!"

The restaurant comes to life. Movement and noise everywhere. Verbal and his crew stand up, agitated and annoyed. Verbal shoots me a look of daggers. Someone grabs my arm, a man shouting in my face about ruining the scene.  I'm baffled and look for my girlfriend. I call her name but she ignores me as some random woman is applying her makeup while another combs her hair.
