Angelo crushed the paper and tossed it on the sand.  He knew he shouldn't do that, but what the hell does it matter? This remote beach is as secluded as it gets this early in the day. The sun is not yet at its peak and there was enough shade where he was to keep cool. "If I stay here any longer, I'll be baked." he thought. It's bad enough he doesn't have any sunscreen. That's a luxury he couldn't have anyway.

He looked at the note again."*Now it starts*".

His leg ached.

"I'm not as agile as I used to be." the old man grumbled as he took an umpteenth look at the cruel note. He couldn't figure out what "it" was. Alone, without a soul for miles, Angelo had to figure this out for himself.  Forget trying to call someone. Cell phones are useless.

There was a time when he could have solved the puzzle and moved on.  His brain was that quick.  Everyone who knew him praised his talent and gift. Over the past ten years, Angelo found it more and more difficult to produce in the same volume and quality he was used to. He was in a drought. Nothing since the divorce. Nothing since the death of his oldest son in a plane crash.

Nothing since.....

He rubbed his aching leg and found some relief from the pain. "I hate plane crashes," he muttered. "No one survives them." Yet here are these nine survivors from nine crashes and he is survivor number ten.

"Survivor number ten," Angelo muttered, "who am I kidding? I can't even survive a day without those damn painkillers yet alone a plane crash!"

The old writer looked at the writing prompt again. A scenario about waking up on a remote island and finding nine other plane crash survivors, and an enigmatic note "Now it starts".

"How the hell do my publishers expect a novel based on this crappy prompt within three months?" Angelo Paxton grumbled. He hadn't written in ten years and his mind was too far gone to care.
