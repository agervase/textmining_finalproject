"You just carry on every day like nothing happened, and I'm stuck here waiting in this ridiculous fucking car.

I paused the video, my breath catching in my chest. I'd listened to this a dozen or so times now, turning the volume up and down, tweaking the audio settings here and there, trying to make out what sounded like a voice inside the car. Finally, I'd just put on my headphones and cranked it all the way up.

I started it again, eyes closed. The impact of my car hitting the 8 point buck rattled my eardrums, but afterwards, the voice picked right back up.

"Well, if that isn't another disappointment. Couldn't you have hit that deer just a little harder? How in the world is this rusted out shit box still rolling on the road?"

It couldn't be. It... just couldn't be.

"God damn it. The engine is still running. Perfect. Maybe I'll be stuck sitting with you another decade while you drive to work listening to people talk about a card game you should have stopped playing when we got out of middle school."

It was Ben. Ben's voice. Of course, that was crazy. Ben had been gone since senior year, when he...

Wrecked his car. Which I rebuilt, per what I thought would be his wishes, with approval from his parents. Hell , if anything, I'd always kind of thought about Ben being kind of a guardian angel over the car and me, not an angry, trapped spirit.

"Next time you get in this piece of shit, I'm going to jerk the wheel even harder. Maybe when you hit the curve going out past-"

My phone vibrated in my pocket. I practically threw the headphones on to my desk. That definitely didn't seem like Ben.

Bailey's Salvage Yard flashed across the screen. I took a deep breath and answered.

"Is this Mr. Evans?" The female voice on the other end asked. She sounded upbeat in a forced kind of way.

"It is."

"Sir, good news! We can fix your car for just a few hundred dollars. Good thing about those older cars, they can take a lickin' and keep on ticking."

I looked back at the video that is still playing on my monitor, not answering. I could have swore I saw something flash against the wheel as I began to pull away from the scene of the deer incident.

Play in the wheel, that's what I'd told myself.

"Sir, how does Friday sound? Sir?"

I hung up, still feeling a cold chill running up my spine. Should I let them fix it and then just trade it in? Or maybe I should just light the damn thing on fire...

Either way, I wasn't getting behind the wheel of that thing again.
