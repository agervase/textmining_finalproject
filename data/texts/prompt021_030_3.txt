I’ll make this quick because I’m about to commit suicide, and reserve the same fate as the others.
These are my last words, and I want those who are on this doomed earth to know the truth.

I picked my victims wisely, and those who are reading this. You are those victims.

I was cursed with this blade, set to decide the fate of who will live and who will die. I made it simple, a polite greeting, a smile, giving your seat to someone in need.

Most of you failed this, and the new earth is barely populated I didn’t travel much I made my rounds through the North American continent, most of Canada survived and they’re in the better place now the new earth.

I tried my best to reach the rest of the planet but time held me back, I only had so much time and as the day draws nearer when I know I’ll be found. I want to take my life, and be with them.

With that, I leave you. Pray to your gods, and may they have mercy on your soul.




















The sun wakes me from my sleep, I try to love but I’m stuck my body won’t move I can look around but I can’t speak.
I’m hooked up to tubes, they’re in my arms, my face my nose...what’s going on.
I can see people around me, lab coats, scrubs am I in a hospital?

I try to scream but it doesn’t work, they don’t even know I’m awake. One of them cover over to me and checks my vitals.
“His eyes are open” says a man in a coat
“That means it is complete, the test is over” I hear a voice but can’t see the owner 

I hear plugs being pulled, and my life fading a light welcomes me as I rise from my bed.
I see green pastures every person I’d killed to spare their life is there waiting for me.
I’m greeted with smiles, hugs and tears I am a hero. 


Or so I think...till a blade slides deep into my back, and a solitary voice coming from everyone says.
“We didn’t ask for this”





I jolt up out of bed, my dog licking my face to calm me. It was all a dream...
