As I walk through Main Street, on my way to work, it's as if I'm in a whole different world. The streets are clean, devoid of trash and of the homeless. Several cameras line the facades of these office buildings, peering into everyone's soul. The air gets moist and sweat beads begin to form in my hair. I roll up the sleeves on my white collared shirt to give me some breathing room, only to see the man ahead of me do the same with his white collared shirt. The stout woman to my right doesn't look at me as she rolls up the sleeves on her white collared shirt as well, also acknowledging the heat.

It's been like this since Rocket-Man was killed by Mister Diabolical, seven fateful days ago. Rocket-Man stood for peace, prosperity and the American Way all while zipping around The City on his technologically advanced rocket, with a smile plastered on his face. He always beat "the bad guy". Whether it was Doctor Doomsday, Mrs. Mayhem or even the Intimidating Isolationist, Rocket-Man always took their unconscious bodies to the penitentiary.

But then Mister Diabolical arrived. With a body made of steel impervious to Rocket-Man's attacks, he murdered "our hero" for the world to see. His iron fist crushing Rocket-Man's skull, a smile gone forever. As I continue strolling towards my workplace, a billboard lights up, flashing the crime statistics for the previous night. I'm not surprised to see zero homicides, zero robberies and only one instance of public drinking. That is to be expected when all firearms and knives are seized from civilians, correct?

I walk into the doorway of my workplace, raising my hands to let the metallic robot scan me for weaponry. It detects nothing and I walk further but stop again, to be frisked and prodded by another robot-- still searching for contraband. After being granted clearance, I walk up the blood red stairs, nod to my boss and his steel face nods back.

We have much work to do today.
