You know the worst part about having the power I have? I can never have my fries fresh.

You know how certain things are harder than others? For example, how rocks are harder than pillows? Well, it's backwards for me. The harder an object is, the easier it is for me to destroy it. But the softer something is, the harder it is for me to make any kind of impression.

As you can imagine, it's hard to disguise this in everyday life. I mean, wouldn't you give a weird look to the guy struggling to eat cotton candy at the fair? Luckily, working in construction as demolition is the obvious choice for me. A lot of the guys on site wonder how I get done as fast as I do, but I evade the question as much as I can.

To be fair, this came in handy last year when I was in a car accident. I was going through an intersection when some asshat in a Corvette t-boned me. Our cars were totaled, but I barely had a scratch on me. I pushed my door, and it caved like rice paper. He wasn't so lucky. I could hear him screaming, and when I looked over at him, I nearly threw up. All I could see was blood. I ripped his door open, trying to find out where his body was in the wreck. I eventually found him, sandwiched under his car seat and pressed against the asphalt. Considering how I am with soft things, I had to go the long way around to get him out. By the time the paramedics arrived, he was barely hanging on.

I didn't stay around to find out if he survived. I didn't want to know. After seeing him nearly bleed out, I didn't want to hear that he didn't even survive afterwards. Let me believe what I want.

Thinking back on it, maybe I could use this "gift" for something better than breaking down old buildings. Maybe I could make sure people survive their wrecks. I don't know, maybe I could see if that guy is still around.

Here's hoping no one gets buried under a mountain of plushies or anything. I'd be as helpful as a blind eye doctor.
