I look into the eyes of each person stood before me, bewildered. Did I know these people? Are the allies? Could they be my... enemies? I could only think about myself and my own survival, my imagination thinking the worst from the countless hours of battle royale games I had been playing recently. I turn over the note and read the words aloud, "Head north, look for a clearing, good luck contestants." 

A faint whirring of an old cargo plane gargled overhead, dropping a crate, how big was anyone's guess, it was too far away.

Suddenly one of the contestants screamed like a banshee, rushing towards another, puncturing his throat with a pocket knife, falling to the ground and choking on his own blood. A few others panicked and chased each other up the beach and darted into the jungle towards the crate.

Three contestants remained on the beach, glaring in a Mexican standoff. I reach into my pocket slowly to procure my compass

"Wait!" a stranger exclaimed, "We have to work together, please! I have a family!"

"Calm down, it's a compass, those fools ran east, the note says head north so that's where we're going. I want to get home too." The two strangers gave a small nod, and we started heading into the jungle.

Distant screams could be heard from the east, I guess another one bites the dust. Just a short walk later, we came to the opening, the sun cracking through the undergrowth, blinding our vision. As our eyes adjusted, there stood two people, one seeming to hold a huge shoulder camera.

"Hello contestants and welcome to Bear Grylls, Island Survivors."

It clicked. Ursine Airways. A laugh cracked from my dry mouth.

Bear Grylls looked confused, "Where are the other 7 contestants?"

End.

P.S. I hope you liked it, just had the thought of taking it down this route. My first time posting a response to these so feedback welcome. Haven't written a short story in around 8 years.
