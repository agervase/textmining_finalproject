It was 11:00 on a Thursday that I found myself huddled in me cubicle questioning my sanity. This was because just a few minutes ago I was walking back from the bathroom when I noticed a cubical which was usually empty now held what I initially thought was a guy in a trench coat. However a few steps later my eyes quickly corrected me; that wasn't a bald man, that was an seal's head! So there I was, hoping the company insurance covered sycophantic medication when I decided a second opinion should be taken before I commit myself. So I walked over to the water jug luckily Walter was also there.

"Hey Walter have you noticed anything, odd, about the new guy?"

"Wait which one?" he asked wearing a confused expression.

"That guy over there"I said pointing to the seat which held my new flubbery co-worker, who's arms were now flopping aimlessly over his keyboard.

"Oooh you mean Jim! No the only odd thing about him is how nice hes been. Like, its his first day on the job and he brought the department donuts!" 

"Well don't you think he looks a bit.. you know.. off?" I said growing increasing worried that my theories of lunacy might be right after all.

"Oh well now that you mention it, he does look eerily similar to the host of mythbusters. Besides that I don't see what you're talking about. Do you not like the guy or something?" he asked with a expression which made it seem like he was personally offended by the idea. 

"Naw man I was just curious" I shot back defensively. We both finished our water in awkward silence and returned to our seats. 

I started back on my work and figured it would be best to leave him alone. It's not my job to question HR's new diversity policies and making a fuss would only fuck me over. I just hope next time I get a damn doughnut.

Edit 1: I fucked up I was thinking of seals lmao
Edit 2: Thanks to whoever gilded. Makes the fuck up hurt just a little less <3
