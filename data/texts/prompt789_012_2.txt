The iOdyssey X9 is a car like no other. It's stylish, expensive... and it also can predict the future. This thing is amazing. Think of the car from Thunderbirds, but generally with less pink. The iOdyssey X9 includes the latest technology from Apple, so it can see into the future and change shape to suit your day, but sometimes the GPS doesn't work.
You win some, you lose some, right?

Sure, it set me back a pretty penny, but there's nothing better than knowing that you can walk out your front door, drive to work, and you'll never get stuck in a snowdrift. Or fall off a cliff. Or... I could go on. 

Anyway, so one morning I was off to work when I stepped outside the house and saw that my car had morphed into a tank.  Now, that's not wholeheartedly odd - I had been an extra in a war documentary the last time it had happened, and I had visited a tank show the time before that - but this occasion seemed... different.

It might have been the fucking giant gun on top, but that could have just been me.

I headed off to work, driving along in my tank. I waved out to all the people I was passing in the street below, but they mightn't have been able to see me because of the *tank* thing. Everything felt weird and I wasn't sure why.

I was about halfway through my journey when it hit me.
The bomb, I mean. That hit the iOdyssey X9 a lot and I nearly went flying out of my seat.

But what really hit me when the lights flickered and went out was the abrupt realisation that I didn't charge the car the night before. I felt the car shift around me and I was suddenly back in a beat-up Toyota Corolla with bombs falling around me.
(I bootlegged my iOdyssey X9, sue me.)

I was going to die and it was all because Apple's products couldn't hold a charge. FML.
