I had lived a good, albeit pretty boring life. I was born and raised in a small town and the only time I ever left was when I was a kid and we took a family trip to Mount Rushmore. I hung out with the same people everyday from childhood, through college and well into adulthood. 

As I sat watching the sunset I remembered it all with fondness and a twinge of regret. My life was as average as could be. Same boring job, same boring house, same boring town. The craziest thing I did in my life was leave my wife to be with the cute new girl at work. I don’t know why I did it, maybe I just craved something different in this prison I called life. But it was all in vain and shortly after I fell right back into the same boring routine I had before but just with someone else. 

As I grew older people started to go away, mother died of a heart attack, hadn’t seen father since I was a kid, and then a freak accident took the rest of my family away from me. I was alone, I had nothing and no one, even the pleasant old man who sold me magazines every morning passed on. 

I looked down at the almost finished bottle I had and took one final swig before I swallowed as many pills as I could. As I started to fade I felt myself being transported and rising. I cleared my head just enough to find myself in a room full of monitors and a massive window overlooking Sea Haven Island??? A man stepped in front of me bathed in light and as tears streamed down his face questioned “why Truman?! Why would you do this?!” I was confused, was this god? Was I in the hospital? As my vision faded I realized I may never get the answers as the man turned away and the last thing I ever heard was “end transmission.”
