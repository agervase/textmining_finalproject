I felt the chill encompass the house as *he* approached. It was unmistakable. 

You see, we all receive some kind of gift when we come of age. It could be a bow, a sword, or if luck truly finds you, the gift of magick. While we don't all receive exactly what we wish, the gifts never fail to be absolutely necessary. The gifts decide your life, your trade, your status, and ultimately, your fate.

Some become hunters, some become warriors, or adventurers. Somehow, as I felt the inexplicable chill of *him,* I was fully aware of my destiny. *He* is everything that saps your Humanity. *He* is darkness, cold, fear, and the harbinger of Death itself.

I'd always been told that those *he* comes for can feel *his* presence. I'd receive no gift today, rather than to be pardoned of the burden of life.

There was no knock on my door, as the hooded mass, devoid of light, materialized before my eyes. Dark tendrils spindled from the being's cloak, seemingly enveloping the light around them. *He* was darker than black. *He* was the absence of light.


I felt no fear as *he* spoke. The voices of a thousand souls filled my ears, speaking in unison to form coherent thought. "Calm yourself, child. I do not seek to harm you."
*He* pulled away *his* hood to reveal, not a face, but a void. First, filled with blackness, but as I stared I saw stars and galaxies, and I was made to know the secrets of the universe. As I stared into the void, wishing only to stay there forever, *he* extended *his* arm to me. A simple wooden scythe, much like I'd used in the fields my whole life, materialized in *his* palm, emitting a soft glow and hum.

*He* did not speak again, but I knew what I had to do. I'd been cursed with sight, made an outcast by knowledge of the unknown. I felt *his* sadness, *his* joy, *his* pain. I knew imparting this gift, rather, this curse on me brought *him* anguish. I knew that this was a passing of the mantle, that *he* could finally pass to the other side. 

*I* reached out and gripped the scythe, and as we both began to fade, filling our destinies, *I* heard a final whisper - *"Thank you."*
