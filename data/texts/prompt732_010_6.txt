We've all watched monster movies. We know how every godzilla movie has that mandatory scene where a row of tanks fire at the monster and it *does nothing.* 

It's a little bit like how every alien who shows up on star trek beats up Worf to show how tough they are. 

In the monster movies, eventually someone turns up in a big robot and slow punches somehow subdue the beast where tank shells failed. 

Unfortunately for humanity the  square-cube law basically means that giant robots don't work.

Fortunately all the other laws of physics say that when a barrage of armor piercing shells filled with high explosives and traveling at 5 times the speed of sound hit something made of anything similar to flesh, muscle and bone... the **best** case scenario for the target is that the shells will punch *all the way through* and come out the other side. 

Further, there's  no laws of war when it comes to The Deep Ones. 

The Great Old Ones aren't party to the Geneva convention.

Shoggoths never took part in any gentlemens agreement about the use of chemical and biological weapons. 

Yig didn't turn up to the Ottawa Treaty on landmines. 

It's said that many of the Great Old Ones are mere projections of from a higher set of dimensions into our universe, like someone poking a finger into [flatland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfglluny8Z0)... but an important thing to remember is that if you poke an arm through flatland, the inhabitants can still slice through the flesh that passes through their plane... and you can still bleed to death from the wounds. 

It's been said that looking upon one of the great old ones can drive a man mad.... but the horrors of human warfare have been breaking the minds of soldiers for thousands of years yet that never stopped them from sending more young men to those battlefields. 

When Cthulhu rose from the depths, he, or at least chunks of him rose even further above the mushroom cloud of a 12 megaton blast.
