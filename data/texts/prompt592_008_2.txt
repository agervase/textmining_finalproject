I still can't believe it. After all this time, over so long, they did it. They actually did it. 

My name is James Aurora. I'm a researcher at the Junipian Institute of Breeding Studies. As a member of the newest colony, Junipia,  I am privelaged to be where I am; especially as I am perfecting the ancient art of Breeding. I've had many projects, all in the five colonies- Venui, Manno, Marrow, Aerite, and Junipia, all on different planets. There used to be Earth, too, but that was hit by a comet 400 years ago. Shame, too.

Sadly, people doubt that Earth is going to be the only colony destroyed. Only a few days ago, a secret project has been revealed... A monster, brought among us by my own science. A race of dragons. The poison-tipped fangs of a cobra, the wings of an Eagle, the scales of a Crocodile, and the shock... Oh Lord. You see, as no known animals breathe fire, the creators of this beast have used the electricity of an Eel instead, leading to a Poisonous, Flying, Armored, and Thunder-breathing monster of man's creation. 
The makers call themselves the "Merciful". They have been destroying and killing for centuries, all under one ideal- To kill people before they have a more Savage death. I honestly think they're insane! 

Millions have already fallen, and they have taken over most of Venui. As a researcher, I am trying my hardest to look for a way to reverse my own study, as well as my allies, yet we have no time. A call to arms has been ordered, and billions have come to defend our people. Escape pods to across the universe are all booked, Governments are in chaos, and the 4th Land of Life, Venui... Is in complete and total anarchy. Who will help us? We do not know.

May the ones above have mercy on our souls...
