I found myself floating in the middle of a deep red mist. I saw something ahead. A building, with steps on the outside that defied all logic. As I looked it jumped forward to fill my view. For a second I thought that I’d moved, but no, my eyes had zoomed in like a camera. I wanted to go closer and I felt the mist now drifting past me like cobwebs, sticking to my limbs.  Gliding along and watching it approach, I knew what had happened. The spell was performed backwards, the demon hadn’t come through, I’d gone there.

The building was there now, though I had to adjust my eyes a few times to make sure that I really was. As I pulled back to my widest view I could see into other dimensions that bordered this one. As I zoomed in I could see the atoms that made up the building. I stepped onto the doorstep with a bump. The door was angled to me but as I approached it righted itself to my angle - or I righted myself to it. I watched the carvings either side as I walked along. Pictures of demons and imps, netherbeasts and monsters. Reaching the inner room I saw something that made my heart still.

The creature in the middle of the room turned to see his visitor. Even unknowing to the secrets of the world, I knew that he was the creator of this realm. I knew that he was the creator of all evil and chaos in the world. Worst of all, I knew his face...

He turned, his wide maw opening wide. His dull flame coloured skin stretching and wrinkling around his face. The straw-like fronds that flocked around his ears. Expecting all the fires of hell from his mouth I was instead surprised to hear him speak. ***“This is the best demonic dimension, no demonic dimension is as good as mine, the other demonic dimensions wish they had me...”***
