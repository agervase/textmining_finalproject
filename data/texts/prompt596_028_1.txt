I stumbled back, tripping over something and fell. The ground came up so fast. Smoke. I see smoke and taste smoke. I cough, raising my hand to cover my mouth. Why would I do that, my hand can't block smoke. Feeble. The sky is black but I feel warmth. I look at my arm. It is wrinkled an marked with age. How did I grow so old? I don't know. I try to get up but my hip hurts. Oh it hurts so bad. I probably broke it. I twist and look. I broke it falling over a man. Some stranger.

Sounds come to me. A loud ringing that is so omnipresent I didn't even register it. But now I hear screams and booms. Screeches. Wails. I follow the noise. A great beast standing like a man tears a boy in half. Surrounded by corpses, a few people are still fighting it. Was I fighting it? No, what could I do? I'm old. I can't even stand. Or is that the hip? It hurts so bad. A woman screams at the beast and a bolt of darkness shoots from her hand. It ducks but not enough, a huge chunk of flesh is sheared off its shoulder. The woman stands before it looking confused. The beast takes two steps, reaches out its good arm and grabs her with a wet crunch. A man starts saying the same gibberish the woman did, but is cut off when the beast throws what's left of her at him.

The creature marches over and with a stomp ends his life too. It rises up to full height and turns to survey the carnage. I look too. This was probably a nice town. But it noticed me. It stomps toward me purposefully. Am I to be crushed too? So be it. I can't get up anyway. Best to end my pain quickly. It seems a shame to die alone, without even memories to comfort me. But wait, I do have one memory. A name. As the demon comes I try to out a face to the name. I have no face, but I know it is a name and not just a word. The creature is upon me. Well, if i must die, I can die for something. I say the name.

The creature stops.
