**DING DONG**

“Jason, can you go out and see--” **DING DING DING DING DING DING DONG**

“OPEN THE DOOR. SUZY, JASON, LET ME IN”. 

The voice was familiar, but who would ring our doorbell at 9 PM with such intensity? You quickly got off the living room couch and walked to the door, your elderly mother stumbling close behind. The deadbolt slid to the side and the front door opened to reveal a young man. Before you could say anything, he pushed himself inside and slammed the door, turning the deadbolt in the locked position.

The man ran to the kitchen and fumbled through the cabinets until he found two cups. From inside of his jacket, he pulled out a silver flask and carefully poured out a white liquid. He gestured at the cups and said, “Drink this now, this will counter the effects of the poison.”

Mother and I looked at each other. We didn’t know what to say. Under the kitchen light, I could finally see the stranger clearly. He looked like my father, but yet he wasn’t. The last time I saw my dad he had balding hair, slightly wrinkled skin, and was thirty five.

This person was a twenty something year old man with well defined arms and shoulders, thick black hair, but... had the face of a man I haven’t seen in fifty years.

With tears in her eyes, mom asked, “John, is that you?”.

The stranger took her hand in his. “Yes honey, it’s me. I know it’s all very confusing to you right now, but I need you and our son to drink this milk. I’ll explain everything after you do.”

With that, we took our cups and drank it as my father stood there eagerly waiting.

I didn’t get it. It tasted like normal milk, a little warm, but nothing special. 

“Dad? What happened? The officers told us that you got killed in a car accident while driving to the store. I saw, **we** saw your body in the casket. Can you please explain what this is all about? What is this milk? Why do you look so young? Where did you--”

“I can explain”, your dad said hurriedly, “but first, we need to get far away from here. I can explain when we’re safe. Come on. You don’t need to bring anything. NOTHING MATTERS. They’re coming for us.”

As to prove his point, we heard sirens begin to wail in the distance, slightly growing in intensity. Dad was already out of the front door. He unlocked his car and we all got inside. Tires screeched as he pulled out of the driveway and quickly drove us away.

The car drive was eerily quiet. The sound of the police sirens faded as we drove into the next city. Everytime we tried to ask a question he silenced us and said he would answer it later. Right now, he was focused on getting us to dog knows where.

An hour later, we pulled into a cheap looking motel in the middle of nowhere. We walked inside the motel lobby and dad booked us a room for one night, cash only.

Finally, after we were in our room, he pulled us to the bathroom, pointed to the mirror, and told us to look. I couldn’t believe it. My mother looked 20 years younger and I was the same.

“The full effects of the milk should be finished by tomorrow morning. It’s time for me to talk.”

For the next three hours, father explained to us how before his disappearance, he was researching the cause of aging. Humankind has long discovered the cure for all diseases for over a hundred years now. People were able to stay disease free, but aging was still a virus that no scientist was able to find a cure for. He explained how he analyzed samples of air and discovered a small concentration of a strange odorless, colorless bacteria. 

Upon further research, he was able to concentrate the bacteria and then exposed it to lab rats. The more bacteria the rats were exposed to, the quicker the rats seemed to age. After extensive research and testing, he chanced upon a protein found in treated milk that neutralized the effects of the bacteria. He kept his research a secret, fearing the unnatural bacteria was developed by sinister entities.

Even with further precautions, the night before the “accident” happened, someone had gone through his lab. He thought nothing of it until the next day, when he was detained while driving to the store. 

Turns out, the governments of the world started spraying the bacteria in the air once overpopulation became a threat. With his research, father threatened to reveal that the government has been poisoning its citizens without their knowledge. After 10 years in confinement, he was able to escape and for 40 years since then, he’s been on the run, only able to return home now.

"What do we do now?"

"Now, we rest. Tomorrow, united as a family, we fight to let the world know of their government's actions. So, anyone hungry for apples?"
