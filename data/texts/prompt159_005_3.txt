The endless sheet of black paper began to fill, concepts and shadows of shadows took form. Four artists were made, so that the universe could follow.

 On the endless sheet they each began their work. The First Daughter had begun, Tune, and in the emptiness she began to conduct. Tune’s work required no matter and in absence of it she gathered the blackness with pauses in between. At first, simple rises and falls. Then she began layering and repeating endlessly to orchestrate symphonies from the screaming void.

The Second Daughter was stirred, and gave a quality to the music. Vista added to the rhythms and changed their nature without changing their measure, giving indescribable color to the music. The endless sheet was no longer black but illuminated to the infinite.

The Third Daughter saw the endless sheet for what it was and rejected its dimension. She desired more, and so she took the now brilliant paper and folded it, crumpling it up and giving it a body. Shape held the color and sounds in her hands and began to sculpt it, letting her sisters’ work resonate in a vessel.

The Fourth Daughter saw her older sisters work. Instead of creating anew, she took their art and the art of her father and synthesized it. Scansion refines each piece into stanzas, perhaps creating the most important medium. Her poems began to move, and the sculptures spun. The matter grew and reproduced, orbits danced about in exact time. 

Now, I am old. The tale has been spun and the Muses will weave it into a great Harmony. I am Story, it is good to finally meet you, though you’ve known me for a while now. I am the immortal made by this prompt, and I hope you have enjoyed my company. My time is near, but I’ll be back soon and in many different ways. If you ever feel lonely feel free to call on me and together we can create any world you wish, I’ll be at beck and call. Thank you, by the way, because no matter what I create I can never do it without those like you, The Authors.
