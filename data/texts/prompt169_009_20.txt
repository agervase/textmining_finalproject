God spoke to Abe and he said. "You think it's so easy? Here, you do it. I'm going out to lunch."

 When God returned he spoke to Abe again and he said "Not so easy, is it?." 
Abe said "Look god, I have done many great works, 97% Accuracy, runtime down by 80%." God looked and beheld the truth of what Abe said. He looked at the peoples of the world, and in each city and town, there was trust and fellowship. There was no starvation or homelessness or hardship of any kind. No man took more for himself at the expense of another, and all were equal. 


"How did you fix it?" Asked God.
Abe said "Well first off you had an issue with your hardware, GPU's were overheating. It was causing some problems, glitches mostly, trapped spirits, evil monsters that sort of thing. I replaced your cooling system, put in new Ice Caps and Changed your Atmo Filter and it's working fine now.


"Next lets look at your structure: Here you've got plates not connected and moving around, that's causing problems. Over here you have lava spilling out onto the crust, that's just impracticable. So I made this layer here solid all the way around. Now during warmup, the Glacier system will run properly. "
"Now The algorithm itself, has some major issues. The Evolution engine is working fine, but the behaviors function was really messed up. I've rewritten it completely. Now they pretty much all live in harmony and work to produce great things." 

God said to Abe "What happens when you run it?"
Abe reset the console and typed: "run C:/Users/Carl/hello_world.univ"
They sat together and watched as the universe was born. The galaxies spread out glowing and violent. Light and dark flowed in shimmering waves over the void. Then suddenly it was done, the last sparks of light faded into the inky black. 
"Let's see what we got" said Abe.

God stared at the display and said "42? what's that supposed to mean?"
