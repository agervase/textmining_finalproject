It wasn't the usual delivery guy that I opened the door to. The man infront of me had a hood pulled up tight to mask his face in shadow.

"Pizza delivery. You uh, you wanna start a tab?" The man asked whilst shifting his weight between his legs.

"A tab?" I enquired.

"Ye, you're obviously a—*sniff*—you know, a connected guy, so you don't need to pay right now if ya don't want." 

He shoved the box into my arms and walked away.

"We'll be in touch." He yelled back at me as he got into his dull white delivery van.

Customer service had clearly improved at the Three Moustachios. I took the steaming box into my lounge and turned on the tv. 

*Oh for Christ's sake. Crust on the pizza. The pranker has become the prankee.*

I was disappointed that they had ignored my request. They had seemed genuinely interested in my order when I had placed it.

I took a slice of the pepperoni goodness and bit into it. It wasnt bad. I quickly devoured it all the way up to the crust.

*Oh my god, they are really taking the piss. Stuffed crust! I hate stuffed crust. Stuffed with powdered mozzarella by the look of it! Well fuck it, I'm not going to let them win.*

After a couple of bites of the mozzarella powdered crust, I actually  started to develop a taste for it.  It wasn't long until I was ignoring the pizza and eating only the deliciously moreish crust.

"Where the hell have you been?" I yelled at the hooded man as I shook him vigorously. 

"I'm — I'm sorry man. You only ordered 10 minutes ago." 

I wiped the mozzarella powder from around my mouth and stared at him. He look petrified.

"Where. The. Fuck. Are they. Hand them over!"

The man handed 5 more crustless pizzas over to me. But it wasnt enough! I pushed him to the floor and ran into his van. I devoured another twenty crusts before I felt the sweet release of sleep begin to wash over me.

God, I loved pizza.
