I sucked in a breath, exhaled slowly. Reducing the carbon dioxide in my system, increasing oxygen flow to my muscles. 

Stepping into the cage, I eyed my first opponent. Well defined musculature, he moved with the easy coordination that comes from years of training. 

As the fight started, his hands came up, protecting his face, as he assumed the stance of a boxer. His feet were a little wider apart than normal though. Probably kickboxing, then.

It didn't really matter.

His lead knee twisted slightly, indicating an incoming lead jab. I slipped to the side, blocked the follow-up lead leg high kick aimed at my temple. I struck with a quick finger strike into the back of his calf, temporarily paralysing the tibialis anterior muscle. His eyes widened slightly at the sudden pain.

Credit where credit is due. He immediately shifted his weight to his rear leg, and threw a cross. Didn't even stumble. Again, it didn't matter. Cupping my hand, I ducked under the cross and lightly struck his ear. The air pressure jarred his inner ear, offsetting the Organs of Corti that are so crucial for balance. From there, it was easy work to land an overhand punch into his temple, knocking him out.

"Aaaand that's the first knockout of the night for The Surgeon!" The announcer screamed over the cheers of the crowd.

I smiled, shifting my breathing back into an even rhythm to normalize my heart rate and oxygen levels. Two more fights, and I'd have enough money to last me until after exams.

The cage opened, and my second opponent came in. I frowned. This guy was different. He had the easy grace I've seen in all seasoned fighters, but he was thin. The bones of his shins and forearms were smaller than those I normally saw in fighters, indicating they hadn't been built up by continually striking and punching bags. This guy wasn't a martial artist, yet he looked at me and smiled.

"And for the next fight! It's The Surgeon vs LEVERAGE!!!"
