I stare at my hands, all bloodied up from the sins of the ones who call me. They gave me the name “Mary,” which is ironic to be honest. Mary is the Mother of Jesus, and I’m no where near her level. She is praised, I am feared. She is loved, I am hated.
For what reason should I be hated? The reason is simple yet hard to acknowledge: I am the Mirror Maiden. I reflect their true personality. I reflect the darkest aspects of their spirits and minds alike. The more blood, the worst the sins. The more injuries (which don’t exactly mean more blood) the worst the mind state.
It’s difficult to acknowledge your true self, but that’s the rule. Overcome the fear and horror, I can grant three wishes. But don’t? Well... it’s not my fault if they are haunted when they open the door to spirits.
Or worse-
“Bloody Mary.”
Oh? A young little boy. Perhaps eight?
“Bloody Mary.”
He’s alone. Poor child, you should never be alone.
“Bloody Mary.”
A door opens in the dark abyss, and so I walk through it.
At first, I’m very clean. A modest white dress and no injuries or anything of the sort.
It always starts out like that.
I then peer into the boy’s scared brown eyes, he looks scared, but not frightened.
Cuts and scratches appear on my arms and legs, and the sting tells me...
“You shouldn’t have disobeyed your father,” I say with a cluck. “And you should’ve picked up you mess and- oh!” I snap my fingers, “You shouldn’t be hitting your older sissy! Not nice!”
I notice that he hasn’t run away yet, and frown. What does he want, exactly?
I clear my throat, “well, I can grant any three wishes, but nothing about death or more wishes and I’ll grant you them happily.”
He pales from his coffee skin and his whispers are barely audible, “I wish mama would be healed from cancer.”
