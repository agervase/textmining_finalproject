*"Checkmate,"* said Death. Oh right, context.

 I'm Ralph, and I'm dead. I got hit by a car apparently, but I survived that, and went walking off. If you've never been hit by a car, your first instinct might not be to write down the plate number, or to make any form of complaint. In my situation I apologised to the man who ran a red light, because I was very addled by adrenaline and 1000 newtons of muscle car to the gut., and waddled off. People asked if I needed medical attention, and I said no, because I didn't want to be rude. So I waddled off into an alley and got stabbed in the liver. I didn't really expect the serial killer, but to be fair, I felt dazed. 

So then I see a nice black and white post-modern office with a black table, white chair, and a very handsome black man with a white suit and a black goatee. It was either death or a very rich, mature, and fashionable edgelord. I can put two and two together. And with a polite mannered voice came *"Hello, are you feeling well?"*

"I'm either kidnapped or dead. So confused works. Death, right?" He was taken aback, pursed lips, straightened posture, the whole shebang. I suppose he was used to giving a whole schpiel.

*"Oh. Well, yeah. I'm used to giving the whole schpiel, but I feel like you're genre savvy enough to figure it all out. But first, take a seat."* Death waved me over to his desk, and pulled out a black and red chessboard.

"Not gonna lie, it's taking me out of the moment."

*"Excuse me?"*

"The board. I figured it would be black and white. What with the whole room and all."

*"Yeah, no, I get that, but I figured the contrast would work. I suppose I shouldn't have made it match halfway. I have one that matches, if you want?"*

"No, it's fine. Sorry, why the chessboard?" I sat down, and tried to get back on track. 

Death gave a wan smile. *"Your life. If you can win, congrats, you can come back to life. Second chance and all."* He spun the white pieces toward me. Why couldn't they be red? *"No negative consequences, just a game. Are you in?"*

"Sure," and I move my left knight. 

________________________

A bunch of chess stuff happened. Now we're up to the *checkmate* bit.

*"Such is life. This wasn't actually possible to win, just a metaphor for inevitability. I'd never lose, but people complained about not getting a chance, so I made this up. I'm sorry"* Death grinned with with eyes closed.

"Uh, no." Death was still grinning, but his eyes were open, and his brows raised. "Yeah, that's just check. Lemme move my bishop, a--nd check."

*"Excuse me, you must have misheard. You can't win. You're in checkmate."*

"No, you messed up. You just were a bit eager to give the grandiose script."

*"Huh. Well, I'll just push my rook, and now you're in check."*

"No, mate."

*"I thought you were English."*

"No, no. Checkmate."

*"Not yet, I haven't won, see?"*

"No, yeah. You didn't. I did." And I pointed it out.

*"I beat Kasparov."* he said, fairly bewildered. 

"Kasparov died?" And now I'm bewildered.

*"20 minutes ago"* and waved it away like nothing.

So now we're just staring at each other. He has nice eyes. "Hey Mort- is Mort okay?- can I go back?" I lean forward and grimace.

*"That's not an original joke. And no. You weren't supposed to win."* and he just stopped looking at me.

I shuffle around a bit, and ask another question. "That's a bit sore, innit?" with another grimace.

*"Well, you're severely mutilated, bled out, and the car sent a rib through your right lung. You'd just die again."* and he sounded troubled. I guess he cared a little.

"Can I reincarnate with my previous memories?" Because I felt like that was reasonable.

*"You'd be a lonely fetus with memories, and after the first month, you'd probably go insane."* said death with a sigh. Then he lit up suddenly *"Do you want to help me with being death?"*

"Why? Is the pay good? I'm fine if it's fun, though."


*"Well, you'd have no need for money, and this is very stressful. My hairline was receding, so I just shaved it off."* That was a good choice. Just give up, if you're handsome, then you'll look better bald. But choosing to be death sounds horrible.

"I'll pass. By the way, are you free tonight?" I might as well shoot my shot. What's the worst that can happen.

*"Can we pretend that a date is suitable compensation for this? Because, for the life- well, anti-life- of me, I can't come up with anything better."* so he turned the office into a restaurant. I'm in slacks and a dirty cardigan with a shirt and tie underneath. He notices this and hands me a suit and points a finger. *"Sorry, bathroom is over there."* Why he couldn't magic it on, I'll never know. 

Anyway, that's how I ended up in the ether in a relationship with the inevitable end of all. You said you met in a winery, right? That's nice.
