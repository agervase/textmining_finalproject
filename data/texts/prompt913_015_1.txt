"You've summoned me? To be your master tactician, for a war to take back hell?" I ask.

What I didn't say was that I was only a master tactician in my video games. I was a good one though.

"Why, yes I don't see why that's so hard to understand." The devil replies.

"I have so many questions." I have to stall. There's some way out of this. "I--Wait a minute, am I dead?"

"Yes. It's a side effect of the summoning I'm afraid." The devil says. "My divine magics are a bit rusty, I haven't used my powers since well my last war."

"The last war? The one against God and heaven?" I ask.

"Yes, it seems that I haven't the greatest mind for warfare, divine or infernal it seems. I suspect it's by design." The devil stares at me. "Enough about me, what about you? I'm afraid summoning can be so imprecise without omniscience."

"I'm really dead? Those pearly gates were the gates to Heaven?"

"Yes and yes. And before you tell me, yes I know that your not even Christian. Apparently there's been a clerical error upstairs. Funny how that happens despite the boss knowing everything."

"How'd you know that?"

"I read your Facebook. Unfortunately, it tells me nothing of your skills as a tactician. Do tell."

"I, um, well--the thing is... You know how someone can earn the title of Master Tactician without actually, you know, um. Tacticianing?"

"While I do have all eternity; I do not have much patience. Speak simply, human. Do not slither your words past me. I who created silver tongues."

"I've played every Fire Emblem game twice. Including Thracia."

"Ah, I believe this is someone's idea of a joke." The Devil looks up, his eyes narrow. He looks back to me. "Do you have any other questions before I torture you for eternity?"

"Yeah, um, do units have permadeath in hell?"

The Devil looks at me confused. He tilts his head and furrows his brow. "No." He answers, "No, they don't."

"You'll want to find someone who plays the mobile game then."
