As I walked along with Thomas we talked not with words, but with thoughts. Thomas can read minds and communicate with thoughts. I would guess he's in his mid thirties.

He's been my mentor for almost a year now, soon it'll be my 19th birthday and it'll be assessed whether I'll be officially classified as a superhero.

*Let's grab a bite to eat* , he projects to me, as we turn into a fast food restaurant.

We join the long queue. Suddenly a young man dressed in black storms through and walks straight towards the counter.

*He's queue cutting, I'm going to challenge him!* I think.

*Don't. We don't do small things, remember?* I hear a stern reply.

*Due to the risk of our identities being exposed. I've been to the school. I'm a shape shifter* I reply.

*That's not the real reason* I hear a thought.

Suddenly I find myself floating in the middle of space. I can see thousands of stars. I've been here before, once. This isn't real.

*Deviant* says Thomas, showing an image of a young man. To start with the appearance was that of the queue cutter, but then his face and appearance kept changing.

A shape shifter villain, perhaps destined to be my archnemises.

*No. You must never challenge Deviant*

Suddenly the scene sifted to two men in a desert, thousands of years ago. One Immortalis the immortal, the other Deviant.

*An Immortal?*

Suddenly Immortalis spoke and the view point shifted to him looking at Deviant, first person. This was a memory Immortalis had shared with Thomas.

"We have fought for many years and there have been casualties on both sides of various hero's and villians. I wish to put an end to this war. I wish to negotiate... My surrender" said Immortalis.

"Finally." Deviant smirked.

"You know, I never wanted to cause real trouble. Just little bits here and there. Being immortal is no fun if I don't get what I want. You started this war. My terms are simple. No-one will ever challenge me again and in return, my misdemeanours will only be minor things you won't really care about" he smiled. The two men shook hands.

*The Great war, I'd only heard stories. The origins of the Nemises agreement and no kill agreement... How powerful is he?*

"Unspeakable" said the voice.

Suddenly we were back in the queue. Only a second had passed.

The young man, Deviant, walked past me with his drink and meal bag. I turned my head away in fear.
