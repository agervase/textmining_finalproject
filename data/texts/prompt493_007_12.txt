  (I want to preface this by saying I've never responded to a WP before so this may be rough) 
  

I tried to cross the street so we could continue playing our game but I guess I wasn't paying attention to the cars driving by. I felt pain, I was suddenly across the street, and she screamed my name. Soon she was knelt in front of me, crying over my body. She was caressing me, like she was cherishing how I felt in her hands. "oh my god... No! You're not allowed to die, okay?" She kissed my cheek and nuzzled my face. I licked her hand on my face so she knew I was making that promise. I didn't want to die; I wasn't sure what that meant but it sounded bad. I wanted to always be with her. She was so sweet and always took care of me. She loved me with all her heart. She was my favorite part of every day for the 64 years I had with her. It was odd; my neighborhood friends all disappeared every 2 decades or so. But I always had her. She had children, and they had children too, but she would always be my favorite, no matter how many treats and belly rubs they gave me. When she left with the flashing lights, I finally understood what it meant to die. Her children and grandchildren came. Her youngest son took me in since I had nowhere else to go. I whined and whined when they tried to make me leave the house her and I lived for so long. They let me run off and grab the blanket she knitted me when she turned gray before leaving; at least I'd always have her scent with me. I lived comfortably; her kin took care of me, but I always missed her. 
 
200 years later I'm still "in the family". Several generations of her relatives, people who share her DNA, even if only a little bit. They don't smell like her, but they're nice and treat me well.   
  
Nobody will ever replace her.   
  
I will always be her good boy.
