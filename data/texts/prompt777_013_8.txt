It was happening today, no matter what. My name is Haken Mao, and I was born on the planet Haidoral Prime-a nowhere mid-rim planet with nothing worth noting. I spent 24 years of my life farming and tending to my crops with my wife and son. There was relative peace until the sixty-first mobile infantry of the Rebel Alliance engaged the Empire in a skirmish for the planet. Only 5 hours into the battle, an imperial officer stormed my house and killed my son and wife, also firing a shot into my face. It was a miracle that I survived.

I spent the next 7 months tracking that very officer. I found him and killed him, but it was not enough. I needed more, I needed the very leader of the Empire. The rebels were not an option, they were an unorganized group of terrorists who had no chance. I had to do the job myself.  I enlisted myself as a stormtrooper. The people that I killed and stepped on still haunt me, but it does not matter. My name and scarred face became known across the Empire. I climbed the rungs of the Empire. I served as a pilot, and in my later years as a guard for nobles and politicians. In all, it took 15 years, but I was finally promoted to be a royal guard for the Emperor himself. I only had to wait until the Emperor was done dealing with some Jedi, then it was time to strike. It was then I heard it, almost 5 minutes of commotion then ear-shattering screams. I watched as the Jedi walked out, guiding a staggering Vader. I knew what had happened. I watched as the other soldiers escaped the crumbling Death Star, and I embraced the explosion.
