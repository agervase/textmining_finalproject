"Beer?"

"Nope. I'm driving."

"C'mon, Lulu, the road is straight for the next 25 Miles. The car will do this on it's own."

"Don't call me 'Lulu'.

"Alrighty, Lu."

"Jeez, Wayne, I'm really out of here, as soon, as I can."

"How do you do this? This rusty, old bastard won't get you anywhere near a real city. You would strand on a road somewhere between this endless fields, like a spaceman on mars. But hey, I forgot, that's what you wanted to be. Well, you could start your survival training right here in the middle of nowhere."

"Very funny."

"Isn't it? But seriously, how are the chances, that you get next to a space ship? You are a farm boy, one in a million would be optimistic."

"That's encouraging."

"I know, I know... Man, look at these birds."

"Mmh?"

"Over there. Woah, how fast are we going?"

"65."

"Have you ever seen such tiny birds, that fly so fast?"

"Nope."

"I dunno, are these humming birds?"

"Here? I doubt it - oouch, Wayne!"

"What?"

"Stop it."

"What?"

"Stop poking me. Or would you like to drive me into this fucking trench?"

"What?"

"Heavens, Wayne, how did you manage to get into your pants this morning?"

"By poking them and sheer luck."

"What?"

"That was a joke. Keep your eyes on the road."

"Alright,... - oouch, Wayne! Really, stop it!"

"Stop what? What are you talking about?"

"This isn't funny. I'm driving at 65, and you are constantly poking me in the ear, when I'm not looking."

"You are crazy. Hey, know what? Meredith has called. She wants to go with you to this party tonight. Wacky, wacky."

"And you didn't mind telling... - hey, Wayne, last warning: If you hit me one more time, I stop on the spot, and you could walk the next 20 Miles... so, you didn't mind telling me, that she has called, until now - despite the fact, we sat together on a harvester for whole ten hours straight? You are a true friend."

"Man, I'm a farm boy, too, not a secretary."

"What the... hey, what's this? Is there an bug? Is there a bug on my collar?"

"Yeah, it's big and shiny, and it starts to crawl into your shirt."

"Seriously. Is there something? Wayne? Wayne, get the wheel, uhh, eeh, look at this! What's this?"

"Never seen before. Do you think it's tasty?"

"Look at this tiny... I don't know, it looks like it has antennas or something..."

"Sure. *Hello Earthling, we are buggomonsters from outer space. Surrender or be destroyed!*"

"Is it just me, or do this insects getting more and more weird?"

"Nah, it's just you. Smash it, and keep driving. Or you can feed it to these silly looking birds, which were following us now like five minutes. Seriously, Luke, take a shower, you are attracting a whole lot of odd species, including Meredith. And by the way: These birds are closing in..."
