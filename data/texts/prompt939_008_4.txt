>"ALRIGHT MEN" Yelled The general

>"and women" piped up all the female soldiers

>"and women" muttered the general

This specific faction had been sent to capture a small village in the desert that were producing far too many firearms, which was a big no-no from the government.

>"Now General" Said Lieutenant Rodgers  
>  
>"Yes" barked the general  
>  
>"You do remember what was agreed in the board meeting about the map and table repair budget"  
>  
>"Of course I do" replied the general, gruffly  
>  
>"Then what are you doing right now" 

The general looked down at the map on the table. There was a dagger piercing the main target building and pinning the map to the table.

>"Oh" said the general "Oh God"

Rodgers radioed HQ

>"The generals doing it again"  
>  
>"How dare you" Yelled the general indignantly "For that, I challenge you to a game of five fingered fillet"

The general pulled out the dagger from the table and began to poorly stab around his fingers. Rodgers slapped his palm against his forehead. After only 10 seconds, the general let out a cry of pain as the dagger hit his middle finger right through the middle.

>"General" smirked Rodgers "Not only had you ruined the map, but you have stapped the map, bled on it, torn it, and damaged the surface of a table, your superiors wont be-"

Rodgers was sharply cut off by a bloody dagger slicing through his throat by a very angry and stupid general.

>"DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY" 

he tried to make himself look intimidating by stabbing the dagger into the table but only succeeded in stabbing the dagger through his hand and pinning it to the table

>"DAMMIT!" he yelled  
>  
>"shall we just go sir" said one of the soldiers.  
>  
>"Yes" muttered the general "Carry Out"

As the soldiers all shuffled out and began to get into the vans to attack, the generals superior came in

>"Rodgers sai- OH MY GOD WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT EXPENSIVE TABLE" Yelled the man "AND YOU BLED ON IT TO MAKE IT WORSE" he then took notice of the dead Rodgers "Oh, and you killed the lieutenant"he said "Oh well never liked him"

The general watched in awe as his superior marched out carrying the ruined map and muttering. 

>"Just another day, another budget cut" he said, cracking open a beer "And another lieutenant dead, because of a stupid map"

he chugged his beer, and then spat it out as he realised it had mixed with his blood. Then he thought about blood loss, and drank it to reclaim his blood. He promptly passed out.
