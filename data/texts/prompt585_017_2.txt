When I was chosen as the first human to enter Mars, I was excited. I have always loved the idea of exploring the unknown. However, what I came to experience wasn't nearly what I had expected ...

Shortly after we send a quick message home that everything was all right, me and my crew entered Mars. I felt a little like Neil Armstrong, trembling in excitement as I slowly made my first steps, three times as light as on earth. My crew followed right after me, giving me courage to lead them into the unknown. After a few minutes of exploring and collecting samples from the ground, I start to notice the ground trembling a little. Suddenly, I can feel myself falling, which is strange as I am falling pretty slowly compared to earth. I gasp in shock, having lost all control while watching my comrades floating right next to me. The whole falling process took only about a few seconds and we were falling slowly, yet the impact when I hit the ground manages to rob me of my breath.

While I'm getting up again, I take a look around. It seems we have fallen into a cave, just that it's no natural one, but instead strictly symmetrical. Light is coming from little crystals spread all over the walls and creating a strange vibe. I notice a movement in the corner of my eye and immediately turn around - as quickly as gravity force on Mars allows me to do so at least. A strange silhouette is visible, coming closer. The moment it emerges from the shadows, I can't believe my eyes. The living being in front of my looks pretty human, yet a little off. I can't quite tell if it's male or female ... Frozen in place, I hold my breath while waiting for something to happen.

"Humans, we have awaited your arrival", it suddenly says with a strangely soothing voice. My comrades have gotten up again by now as well. I can't tell what's going on in their minds because I can't see their faces. "You probably have a lot of questions. However, please let me make a very important request first. I'll have to make you choose either a life on Mars or death, I am afraid. You see, we have been observing your planet and the human race for quite some time. We know how humans act and behave. This is why we feared your race coming to our planet. Without a doubt, if the human race found out about us, they'd try to infiltrate our planet sooner or later. Humanity is greedy and they wouldn't just let us live our lifes like before. No, they would try to get our resources, our technology, our place to live". The Marsian stops for a moment, letting its words unfold their impact. I am too afraid to say a word, and I hope my comrades will be smart enough to do the same.

"Obviously, we can't let humans know of our very existence. But at the same time, we are no evil creatures. If you choose to stay on Mars, your lives will stay unharmed. If you intend to leave, however, we will have to kill you. So, what do you say?", the human-like creature asks, its eyes wide open. "F\*ck that!", my colleague Brian shouts through the speaker in his suit, "I have a wife and kid waiting for me! No way I'm gonna-". The glass of his helmet suddenly turns red and he falls to the floor. "Brian!", my crew is shouting, "Brian, say something!". I keep quiet, too much in shock as to be able to act.

The Marsian grins. "I told you, if you intend to leave, we will have to kill you. Choose now and choose wisely ...". My brain is working at maximum speed, every possible plan I can think of is processed within split seconds. I don't want to stay on this planet forever either, but dying is out of the question as well. I open up my message transfer system via voice command, and start to dictate, my voice set to "within suit only": "We were wrong. Planet inhabitated. Do not send rescue". I hope the Marsian didn't notice. Then I say through my speaker: "Alright, we'll stay here. Now what do you want from us?". \[...\]
