They laid on the hill for what seemed to be an eternity. The man was quite perplexed - both by his son's question and his eyes. He could feel himself frown. Was this his son? Where the hell where they? How did they get here? Before he could complete that line of thought, his inner monologue was interrupted by a voice.

"What are Earth's defense systems?" the voice repeated, lower and more aggressively. The child who had uttered those words was leaning towards the man with an intense look in his eyes.

The man did not not respond. His eyes darted around the landscape - not registering any of its features. His brain was overclocked, trying to comprehend his situation.

*Where the fuck am I?*

He slowly began to remember things. Just fleeting images at first, but the memories rapidly and exponentially became more vivid, pushing him towards his destination.

******************************************************************************************

He had a wife once. And a son. They had lived on Io as part of a mining colony when a fleet of 6,000 unidentified flying objects emerged from a section of the Kuiper Belt on the other side of the Sun. Cosmologists across the Solar System scrambled to study this new development, and it was very quickly realised that these were not asteroids. Asteroids did not have engines and enough armament to convert the entire Terran northern hemisphere into a series of smouldering craters within 12 and a half minutes.

Then more memories. Failed attempts to negotiate. Martial law. Conscription. Teary conversations with his wife and kids. Throwing supplies into the rover.

******************************************************************************************

Tears had started to form in his eyes. The memories continued.

******************************************************************************************

Boarding a freight ship bound for Titan. Buying a ship from a scrapyard. Flying towards Pluto - to the boundaries of the Republic's reach and away from the threat approaching Earth. Republic ships approaching from the rear and the panicked expressions of his wife and son.

******************************************************************************************

The tears started to flow as he moved his head towards his hands.

******************************************************************************************

An explosion as a laser hit the right side engine of the ship. His son's screams as the ship careened towards Triton. The roar of a sonic boom as the craft pierced the atmosphere of Neptune's moon. Bracing for impact, and then black.

******************************************************************************************

His howls would have traumatised the child before him had it not have been a mirage.

******************************************************************************************

He awoke with his temple against the steering wheel of the ship. His gaze was fixed on his son's vacant expression. He raised his head slightly. After taking a moment to process the image before him, his mouth was agape. No sound would protrude. He twisted his body and held out an arm as if to confirm what his eyes had registered.

There was a whir behind him. Two arms grabbed the back of his shirt. "Don't resist. You're coming with us," said a disembodied voice.

He had no strength with which to resist, and if he had he did not have the presence of mind to muster it. His captors dragged him from the vehicle and across the ice like a ragdoll. After a few moments, a scream emanated from the wreckage. It was shortly followed by its owner sprinting towards the man and his captors.

The god awful crack of an AR-107 rang unopposed by the silence of the icy wasteland on which the man sat and his guards stood. As his wife's freshly vacated body fell towards the ground, the man felt little. His surroundings had become an abstract collage of colours and sounds.

******************************************************************************************

He reset his gaze on the artificial image seated next to him. His stare was met. Memories of announcements flooded his mind. The Tesla Coil Cannon on Phobos. The Hubble Atmospheric Defense System. And, perhaps most importantly, the Great Red Spot.

He now found a great comfort in the obsidian eyes of his son. He found more solace with this digital construct than with all of those fuckers on Earth combined.

His lips parted and he announced what little he knew - or more precisely, what was announced by the media. He gave vague descriptions of Earth's various armaments and space defenses. He described their functions and (announced) locations.

The face of his virtual companion contorted for a micro-second before attempting to return to its previous cool expression. It cut off the man mid-sentence. "Yes. We know all this," its voice said, with a slight staccato. "We imprisoned you inside a virtual reality and have engaged in direct mind-to-mind communication. I wonder - how do you think our minds operate? What I want to know is how they work!"

Silence fell upon the pair. Neither dared to break eye contact. It was game of chicken which the man lost. His mouth slowly widened as he began to smile. And then he started to laugh.

"How the fuck would a moon miner know how the defense systems work you stupid cunt?" He spat.

The boy's body recoiled as he frowned and averted his gaze from his supposed father. It was now his turn to retreat to his mind whilst the man clutched his abdomen in hysterics - not reflecting the hollowness he felt inside.

This was my first piece of creative writing since I was twelve, so I really would appreciate any and all feedback.

Edit: Well shit, I forgot he wasn't supposed to have a son.
