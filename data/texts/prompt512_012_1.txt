Dr. Hanning chuckled. “Sarah, it’s right here in my notes. You must have mentioned it at some point.” His eyes softened. “Look, I know you’ve been through a lot,” he continued, “and I understand the paranoia, but I promise you, you are going to feel a whole lot better once you take this.” Here’s hoping, doctor. My mind had become a prison, and I would do just about anything to escape back to normalcy. Before Selma could object, I slammed the pill into my mouth and chased it with a shot of water. Dr. Hanning smiled and turned to his desk. “Now if you do hear voices, or have any other side effects, I want you to call me at this number, okay?” He turned and handed me a piece of paper with a number scribbled across it. “I’m serious Sarah, anything abnormal, call me”. He tucked his clipboard under his arm and left. Fantastic. Great thing to hear *after* downing the pill. F\*ck. What the hell kind of side effects? I realized I was waiting for her to chime in, until it hit me. Could she really be gone? Could it really be that quick? I tempered my excitement, suspecting one of her tricks. But not a peep came as I left the building or during the entire drive home. I entered my apartment and audibly sighed in relief as I removed my jacket and sunk into the couch. I felt Dr. Hanning’s paper in my pocket and retrieved it. That’s when I noticed the logo. In tiny red letters centered at the bottom of the page. Nuvosa. My stomach dropped. Nuvosa, it was the same, wasn’t it? The same company that Selma warned me about. The same logo that was stamped on the files. The same red letters in Henry’s photos. Another wave of nausea hit me as I realized in my new clarity that I had been right – I never told Dr. Hanning about Selma’s voice. As the world turned black around me, I realized Selma had been telling the truth the whole time.
