I awoke. 

I wasn't sure how long I'd been asleep. Mom had been trying to get me to nap less now that I was a 'big boy', but I still liked my naps.

I'd had another one of the dreams. I'd decided a little while ago that the dreams were special, just for me. I didn't want to share them with mom or dad, or my icky older sister. They wouldn't get it anyways. 

In this dream, I met the girl again. The one who made my heart beat so fast, made my stomach flutter. I'd only started dreaming of her a couple of days ago, but I couldn't stop thinking of her when I was awake. 

Mom was surprised when I didn't put up a fight at bedtime, but I wanted to go to sleep as soon as I could so I could dream of her again. I wanted to be with her, at the park, at the beach, just the two of us. I know mom said I 'didn't really know what being in love means', but I think that I do. I think I love this girl in my dreams. And I think she loves me. I don't care if I'm 'only five years old', I know what my heart feels.

She's funny. She's smart. She's so thoughtful and kind, and her angelic face and deep brown eyes are framed by glossy, straight hair. When she looks at me, the corners of her mouth turn up in just the hint of a smile, one that causes my heart to flutter. When she speaks, her voice is like a chorus of strings. When she tells me that I am the reason for her happiness, I need nothing else in the world.

She is perfect.

As I get out of bed, I stretch and walk over to the window looking out of my bedroom. In the lush green of the cemetery behind our house, I can see someone is at a funeral. At first, I feel uneasy, like I'm intruding in someone else's private moment. But as I look, I notice her. She bears a striking resemblance to the lady in my dreams. And she's crying. 

And for some reason I don't yet comprehend, I cry with her.
