I hadn't thought about Death for a long time the day I led my granddaughter straight into his arms. I was annoyed with Abby. Impatient. She wanted a very particular type of ice-cream. One she'd had in Toulouse with her parents. "We're in New York," I told her. "So you'd better settle for a New York ice-cream, missy." She threw a fit. I lost my nerve. She called me names. I yelled in her face. So she ran. Turned her back and ran. Probably just wanted to give me a scare, probably thought I had it coming.

The steamroller halted. But not before her skin popped. Not before her bones crackled. Not before a grandfather, a sunny Friday afternoon, was staring at his granddaughter's exposed ribcage.

That day, I made the call.

"Congratulations," Death said.

"I take it I got the job?" I said.

"Of course. You got it yesterday."

"W-What the hell are you saying?"

"Jeez, relax. Oh, and by the way," he said, "sloppy first job. A steamroller? Really? 3 out of 10. You better step up your game."

Death hung up on me. Then there was the knock. I opened the door to see a plump woman with glasses and a ponytail. She was carrying a small bag and some documents.

"Who are you?" I said.

"Jessica," she said with a laugh. In response to my non-response, she added: "your new secretary?"

"Leave," I said.

"But sir," she said. "According to our contract I'm to stay with you at all times."

"What freaking contract?"

She looked puzzled. "The one we signed yesterday."

I called Death.

"There's a woman here," I said.

"Don't worry," Death said. "You can fuck her. Part of the perks. Just one of many to come. Like you later today. Get it? Hah. You know what the French call an orgasm? 'Le petit mort'. The little death. So you can consider it practice. I always did, anyway. Au revoir!"

"What the hell is this?" I asked her. "My granddaughter just died. I called this number, this ... Death appeared to me many years ago. When I cracked the code. When I uncovered the secret to immortality. And I kept it to myself, but he knew straight away. No one knew. No one. And now she's ... She's ... She's dead! She's gone!"

"Ah yes!" she said. "I just finished up the paperwork. I'll have it ready in half an hour."

I stared at her blankly.

" ... tea?" she said, trying on a smile.

Exhausted, I collapsed on the ground. "I-Ice cream," I said. I could see Abby's face flash before me. That lovable little brat. My granddaughter.

"Of course," she said. "I'm so stupid. The ice cream." She reached into her bag and carefully extracted a cardboard box. She placed it on the table and opened it. Inside was a small container of ice cream. The label said *Ã” Sorbet d'Amour*. "Just like you requested," she said, looking awfully pleased with herself.

"What's going on?" I said.

"Eat up!" she said. "We've got work to do. But I'm sure we'll be fine. After all, you're on a *roll*." She winked.
