*In a world...*

"The Ghost Crisis is at its peak!"

"Soon, the entire Earth will be overrun. Mankind is doomed!"

*...haunted by the past...*

"The ghosts of Ghenkis Khan and Napoleon have joined forces."

"The spirits of Dinosaurs are running rampant!"

"The souls of the dead..."

*... One man...*

"Hi, Jimmy Jacobs. Happy husband, proud father of two. Recent amputee."

"Wow, that was a weird way to introduce yourself, Mr. Jacobs. In any event, your loan application has been denied and your house foreclosed. Have a nice day."

*...will take matters...*

"Oh no honey, what are we going to do?"

"If only you hadn't lost your arm in that mine-cart-traffic-accident"

"Aaargh! I just wanna punch something!"

*...into his own hand.*

"My arm... it's incredible..."

"It appears the mine-cart-traffic-accident imbued your spirit with special properties, Mr. Jacobs."

(Punch punch)

"Your phantom limb syndrome appears to have generated a *literal* phantom limb."

"I can punch ghosts..."

*This summer...*

"Ah, Mr. Jacobs. It appears you survived!"

"You should have stayed dead, Nitsche."

"We are all already dead, Mr. Jacobs! Why can't you see that?"

*prepare to punch...*

"Honey, you can't punch all your problems away."

"No. But, I can punch these problems away."

*...until you can't punch anymore.*

"We gotta T-Rex, a warlord, a nihilistic philosopher, a perverted founding father, and a strange, shadowy being calling itself Dignazus, the Eternal Ruler of the Shadow Plane."

"Sounds like a... **handful**."

**PARA-NORMA-PLEGIC.**

"So are you like my quippy sidekick, or something? Do I get one of those?"

"I don't do quips, this is very serious work."

 (Ghost limb snap) "Darn."

"Really, I can't stress this enough. We are here to save the world from an invasive supernatural force beyond our comprehension. It's serious business There is very little margin for error or goofing around."

"Uh oh."
