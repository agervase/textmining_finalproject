Of course, it's Christmas Eve and I'm the one assigned to this piece of shit. A stupid Cold War anti-aircraft gun that I had to hand crank to aim. How the hell am I even supposed to hit a strike fighter with this? It's a *miracle* this thing even has ammunition, seeing how old it is. Obviously, there weren't any operational SAMs left because the nukes fried their electronics harder than mom used to with eggs. I guess the higher-ups needed some way to say that they could shoot down an incoming threat and appease those people hiding inside the bunker. Absolutely hilarious. I'd be blown off the face of the Earth before I even managed to turn the gun around.

*CRSHH*

And that would be my radio, with that fuckwit reporting the radar to me on the other side.

*"Hey, you better be awake."*

*"Of course I am. If I fell asleep, I'd be frozen dead dumbass."*

*"Well, you'll want to hear this."*

*"Why don't you go ahead and* **hurry up and tell me then**?"

*"There's a signature approaching from approximately 1.6Â° relative to you."*

Hah, almost directly north of me. Maybe Santa is going to pay me a visit.

*"Also, it's too small and faint to be a plane. Somehow, I don't think it's a missile either."*

*"And how would you be able to say it's not a missile?"*

*"It's traveling too fast. Good luck."*

Great. The radio went silent. And I had to shoot something down traveling at Mach five billion or whatever. There wasn't a point to this. I might as well just lay back and watch the fireworks above.

*A BLINDING FLASH*

Hoo boy, maybe I'm getting nuked a second time.

*A DEAFENING ROAR*

Hm, radar can't track a shockwave from a nuke though, can it?

*SILENCE AND PEACE*

And what's this? An immaculately wrapped and bow-tied present just for me in my lap? The pattern even matches across the seam. "From Santa" was printed on a side. It's definitely too early to be April Fools, so it must be true, right?. Only one course of action now, and that's to open it.

I quickly tore off the paper, cracked open the lid, and took a peek inside. It was the ugliest, gaudiest goddamn sweater I had ever seen. 

I started trekking back to base. I seriously couldn't deal with the rest of the day. I turned off the radio too, because I couldn't deal with that guy either.
