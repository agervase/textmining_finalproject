"Tower control, got the targets in sight. They're on the west ridge." Through the sniper scope he could see the humanoid figures, dark and nearly shapeless, creeping through the brush. IR picked them out clearly. His earpiece crackled.

*"Confirmed. We see them. Two scouts advancing towards the fence. Piss-poor tactics."* He swept lower, saw the two crawling insect-like towards the wire mesh, limbs akimbo, bellies flat to the earth. By the lake a larger shape moved, claws scraping through sand. At the sound the pair went flat and still, waiting until it ceased to start moving again.

"These guys aren't up to a modern army, remember? Body armour sighted?" There was a pause as the observer relayed the query. He saw the two by the fence, three green lights flashing for sight on their heads. Shoot those out, they'd see nothing. Then they'd be dead.

*"Body armour confirmed. Looks like scale."*

"Do we need 'em alive?"

*"No, Headshots a-okay."* Good. These scum needed to learn that not everything on earth was theirs for the plundering. His finger settled on the trigger, aimed as he calculated position, wind resistance, almost unconsciously. A third was crawling towards them. Two to compromised the fence, one to sneak in and take their prey silently, crawling into the flesh to harvest parts from their victim.  

"Big guy still down?  Ah, they've got the clippers out."

*"Sleeping like a baby. The bullets will wake him up, briefly."* He laughed, watching as the wire mesh was cut and rolled aside, his shots planned and lined up, awaiting confirmation from the radio.

*"Fence is compromised. Fire at will."* The rifle kicked three times. As the last bullet left the rifle, half a mile away the first figure spasmed and dropped. His companions at the gate followed him down, heads exploding as the bullets struck. Damn good shooting if he said so himself. 

"That's three." There was a roar from behind him, the huge shape lifting its head against the sky as it reared. On the fence line tower emplacements opened up, bullets chewing the ridge apart, with everything on it. The massive head swung round, water dripping from it as it watched incuriously, then lowered back to the lake shore. He lay still and unnoticed, admiring the creature, the relic of a bygone age, as it drifted back to sleep. There weren't many of them left now, what with the guns and the tanks. Invulnerability wasn't what it had been.

"All clear. Big guy snoozing," he reported, as the soldiers scurried out the the tower and turned over the bodies by the fence. "Any compromise?" 

*"Confirmed Sanctuary secure, Ranger. No IDs, but a list of Dagon parts and prices for the medical trade recovered."* He swore, reloaded. It was going to be a long night. 


Goddamn poachers.
