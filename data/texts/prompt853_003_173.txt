He slumped down to the ground. They said there was going to be a cold snap tonight. Windchill, too. The shelter was full when he tried to get in. They all were. 

He tried to button up his outermost jacket, but couldn't. His fingers felt like they belonged to someone else. 

He wasn't going to make it. At least he wouldn't be missed, he thought. Just another drifter. 

He thought of the war, Rizzuto and Holmgren and Forlansky and the rest. He thought of what they had to do. He hoped they were doing okay. He hoped they got back okay.

He thought of Carla, and how the light in her eyes just got colder over the years. He thought of why that was. He used to blame her. Used to blame anyone. He couldn'tâ€‹ blame her anymore.

He thought of the kids. At least they're doing fine. Ryan just got promoted at his ad agency. Senior account manager! And Melanie's coffee shop was doing fine.

He thought of when they all stopped visiting him in the home. He thought of the day the home told him they hadn't been paid in some months, and he'd have to leave. He thought of the light in Carla's eyes again. He couldn't blame her.

It's okay. The kids are doing fine.

The alley wall against his back might as well have been ice. He looked up, and watched the air vents watercolour the night sky with steam.

It was the last thing he saw.

*"What?"*

*"Send it forward. Let it help somebody."*

*"But that means --"*

*"I know what it means. Let me have what I earned."*
