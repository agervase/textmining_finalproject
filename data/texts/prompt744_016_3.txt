A great and powerful human hero once said "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 **kicks** once, but I fear the man who has practiced **one kick** 10,000 **times**."

I materialised inside the arena, at my feet lay a a simple musket. What use could this be I wondered, but not for long. Across my vision flew a half dozen other mortals, fighting and shooting each other with various powers as they struggled to take them all down. A vigorous punch would send one of them into the dirt, but they would soon be airborn again. A laser would hit another with little more than a scorch mark. Powers of flying kept them airborn, and superior healing kept them alive and fighting.

I flexed my muscles, but they seemed no different. I jumped into the air with no avail. My patron God had assured me that I knew everything I needed to know to use any powers I had. I didn't even have superior vision as I squinted up through the hazy air at the maelstrom of activity above.

I look down at the musket again. It was already loaded, probably magically. I wrap my ordinary fingers around it, and I can just feel the power radiating from the wood and metal construction. I already knew how to use it from my mortal days, just point and click, so that's what I did.

For all the force the musket kicked back with, leaving me on my ass, I expected an ear shattering boom, but I got little more than the bang of a pop-gun. I recovered my wits and looked up to see the fighting had stopped. Lying on the ground was one of my rivals, a young woman, with a hole where her heart should be. Instantly eliminated. Slowly I noticed all eyes turned to me, but luckily my musket didn't need loading.

Soon I was the only one still standing. Corpses vanishing slowly, mortals returning where they came from, hopefully regenerated. My God approached me and bowed.

"Oh great hero, thank you, I am so proud."

"But, how did I win?" I ask.

"Simple, while the other gods spread their powers thin across all the different kinds of attributes they could give their avatars, I suspected I only had to put all my power into one weapon. And I wasn't wrong."

So I walk high into the Pantheon, the barely-remembered words of a martial arts master tickling the back of my mind.
