A mad cackling sounds from the captains room.....I'm a bit scared now. Nobody said he could do it. 

It was already a pretty fuckheaded decision to bring the dinosaurs back in the first place, but what dipshit in the dankest corners of Aperture decided to give him a motive and a space shuttle?!?

Oh nonono it gets better, the brain was incomplete so they decided "let's splice in a human noggin to complete it" so now he has the intelligence to do whatever the hell he wanted....

Dr. Reggie steps onto the bridge and looks at me, beady eyes glaring into my soul. 

"I have, FINALLY, FUCKING DONE IT." he shouts, with a strange demented smile. The only thing I can sheepishly reply with is "What...what have you done sir"

Dr. Reggie roars with delight with only managing to get out "MY BIG PLAN TO DESTROY THE ASTEROID BELT IS COMPLETE!"

"Oooo...Kay...Let's...think about this logically. WHY. " I retort, arms folded. "Simple: Revenge for my brethe-" he starts while I cut off with "Habababababap shut the fuck up real quick, listen. The human species not only created advanced weaponry to fight off future incidence, but we were nice enough to put you back on the earth as..bad stupid of an idea as it was."

Once again he roars, trying to grab me with his tiny arms. "hold up big guy let's continue, Secondly: An asteroid alone did not do this. It was a super volcano being activated. Wanna get rid-...well I can't defend super volcanoes can I."

He snorts and calms down a tad, going "I still want to destroy it...I NEED revenge..". I finish by calmly saying "Okay how about pluto and his friends up at the kaiper belt?What then? What is this even going to accomplish?"

"I don't know..I just need time. "
