There were many questions I had, but I wasn't entirely sure how to react. I *was* in my house, but *now* I'm in a budget Lord of the Rings.

That included the wizard who looked like he'd both just pissed himself and had won the lottery. 

"Good... GOOD... Now, my slave... DESTROY MY ENEMIES! Turn their skulls into paste! Their bodies into ash! Send their souls... TO OBLIVION!" The mage throatily screeched at me, followed by perhaps *the* most cliche evil laugh in the history of human existence.

"Uhhhh... Wut?"

"You... You're... Not obeying?"

"Sorry dude, but who are you again?"

"ME? I'M THE LEGENDARY WIZARD SALTHAZAR THE ALMIGHTY, DESTROYER OF REALMS!"

"So... Why do you need me?"

"Uhhh..."

"And now that you are here... You shall slay my enemies, and bring this world to its knees!"

"Uhhh... Sorry dude... I don't do anything unless it's in writing..."

"You mean a contract? Never fret! The mighty Salthazar has one right here!" He shoved a piece of parchment in my face, the various scribbles were probably words... Right?

"Now... Destroy, my Demon!"

This guy's clearly mad. Time to find my way back.

I ran around, blowing out all the candles and knocking over as much as I physically could, just generally causing as much damage as possible.

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! STOP DESTROYING MY WORKSHOP!"


"What? You said "Destroy". You never said *what* to destroy after signing the contract." I shrugged and carried on laying ruin to what I'm guessing is this mans livelihood.

Salthazar sulked and slumped into a corner, "Now I see why they told me never to trust Demons..."
