[part one]

Fuck.  Books.

That's right, fuck them.  And no, I'm not trying to crudely imply that I want to sexually ravish books.  No, I mean it in the darkest meaning of that word, from the most contemptuous essence of hatred that syllable can imply.

Look, yes, I know, you are in the middle of your Library of Books dream.  It's an amazing event, and you will read and learn so much before you awake tomorrow morning.  It is a miracle, a gift.  However, you will absolutely read this book.  Everyone who has ever been in here for the last five years has read this book.  I know they have, because I figured out the way this place parses individual want, interest, and desire with volume content relevance.  I've had time.

See, I've been here every night since I was *born*.  Physically, I'm nine years old.  Mentally, I'm "fuck everything and everyone".  And a half.

Right now, I'm certain I'm garnering one of three reactions from you.  Some of you just understood at least a fraction of what I've gone through, and are worried.  I appreciate your concern, and no, I'm not going to kill myself, but I've seriously considered it.  Some of you are morbidly fascinated.  I want this second group to understand, you're likely some degree of psychotic.  There is a decent chance you're already aware of this, and I'm not judging, but if you didn't know, well, there you are.

Then there is the third group, who doesn't get it.  You're thinking I have been given a "gift", that I have something amazing, that I should be thankful.

Luckily, I wrote this book on a good day, so I'll explain my plight, instead of telling you the numerous and interesting ways you can insert that opinion into your own body.

Let me reiterate, I have been here every night *since I was born*.

I spent my first night in this library.  And no, this isn't just a normal library.  I'm not sure exactly what it is, not even I have been able to find out where it came from, but everything you read in here, you aren't exactly "reading".  By some means, the knowledge is just *put into* your brain, and the experience is left as a memory of reading the knowledge.  It is some kind of experience-implantation.  But the point is, you learn it, period.

My first night in this universe, I was force-fed a year's worth of book knowledge.  and it fucking hurt.

My brain wasn't at full capacity yet.  I wasn't seeing or hearing properly, I couldn't walk, I was shitting my pants, I didn't know how to speak, but I had a complete grasp of the English language, and I knew... things.  

My first memories are of my second day alive, but they are jumbled and full and so very, very hurtful.  Nothing is in order.  I know I could understand what everyone was saying, but I can't remember what they said.  And I know I tried to talk back, but I didn't know how to yet.  I knew what the words meant, but I didn't know how to make my throat and tongue create those sounds.  I was so angry, I cried all the time.  They though I had colic, but it was really the beginnings of an existential crisis.

The second night, I was back in the library, and remember how I said that it had a way of parsing book relevance?  Well, my second day alive was full of wanting to know how to talk, and wondering why they were looking at me funny, and hating knowing something without being able to convey it, and wondering why they were all so much bigger than me...

This library, it doesn't just have all *known* books written.  It has all **everything** written, by anyone.  Actually, by anything.  While the place forces you to be able to understand what you are seeing, I'm fairly certain some of these things were written by something... um, not human.  Unfortunately, they wrote about us, not them, and I haven't found much else I am sure is from *whoever they are*, which is amazing to me in a way you cannot grasp.

In any case, there are books on how to speak.  There are books on what noises babies can make, as well as what babies are, and humans.  There are books on language, and knowledge, and communicating effectively, and linguistic theory, and speech writing, and psychology (remember, I wanted to know why they were looking at me in a strange manner.  Fuck curiosity, too.)  Also, I was shown books on mental exercises and meditative retention techniques to help me cope with my, at the time, underdeveloped brain.

I woke up on my third day in this world capable of more eloquent speech than the vast majority of human beings that have ever lived, and the capacity to put it to use.

Now, pro-tip, if you want to freak out a room full of doctors and nurses, open day three of life with, "Pardon, nurse?  Would you please take me to my parents?  I would like to apologize to them for my upsetting behavior yesterday, and explain the reasons behind my unpleasant actions.  Also, if you would be so kind, I need a new diaper.  This one is quite wet."

I never saw my parents again.  I have no idea if this is a bad thing, or a good thing, because I don't know them, nor was I given enough time to form any kind of meaningful emotional bond with them.  I know what I've read, that they were painfully average people, a grocery store clerk and a landscape architect, and that they were killed one day later.  But I don't know if they were lovely and warm, or hateful and cruel.

However, the people who took me?  They were absolute shitholes.

Yes, yes, you are correct, it was obviously a government agency.  However, this is not a mark against the government as a whole, you can decide if you like them or not on your own.  See, it turns out that government agencies are *extremely often* unknown to each other, and operate without any realistic oversight.

Yes, I read all of that, about government organizations.  Yes, in the Library. You're quick.

They asked me a lot of questions, and since I hadn't had the foresight to look for a book titled "Government agencies, and how to tell if they have kidnapped you and are using you illegally", I didn't know to not answer some of them, especially the one about the Library.

It turns out that the Library is a fairly well known phenomenon.  Some individuals have turned around their lives, made their careers on their trip to the library.  Others had prevented (or started) wars, made great contributions to science, had breakthroughs on criminal cases.  And all of them had just one visit.

And here I was, three days old, and I'd had two.

The next morning, I woke up angry, horrified, and ***quiet***.  See, the Library had parsed out to me a few books on government corruption, and human rights, and all kinds of things governments did to their own citizens for knowledge.  It also, however, told me of the physical capabilities of a baby, and how long growing up can take.

I had literally no choice at the time.  I cooperated.

For four years, I lived in a government installation with no windows.  I had read enough to know what could happen to me if I resisted, or did not deliver.  I knew the moment that I stopped giving useful information, they would be vivisecting me to see what happened to my brain when I went to the Library.  They already monitored my brain activity as much as possible when I slept, and some of them probably knew what my gray matter looked like better than my face.  I needed to stay valuable to stay alive.

So, I read confidential files written by foreign powers.  I read the journals of scientists.  I read patented formulas for everything from medication to diet sodas.  I read building schematics, and weapons tests, and cultural studies.

However, I also read about the company names that built anything withing the compound I was kept in.  I read the designs for locks and security systems.  I poured over floor plans, trying to match one to the rooms and hallways around me.

I also read about psychological and emotional manipulation.  I couldn't throw a punch, but I could decide exactly how I wanted these people to feel about me.

I learned language, and geography, and economics.  I learned engineering and software design.

I had a year every night, for four years.  I learned so many things.  I even re-learned how to talk and write like a normal person, because I promise you, my mind doesn't work like yours does anymore.

I waited until I was four because I had estimated that was the minimum age I could be and pass for a grown human with a form of dwarfism.  That was all I needed, to be able to physically appear as an adult.  Other physical developments did not matter, I could get by on make-up or prosthetics (and yes, I had knowledge of both), i just needed the height.  

Now, here is where you are expecting the daring escape story.  Here is also where I disappoint you.  See, I had found the floor plans to the building I was in.  I was also a living expert on every security system, and every computer, and every lock, and every door in the place.  I could even write a detailed autobiography of everyone who worked there (a year each night, remember?).  So, when I knew everyone's routines would leave gaps in oversight, I took some tools I made (no, I 'm not going to tell you what to make to break out of high-security buildings, but if you really want to know, *someone* has written a book on it, I'm sure), and I left.

I knew where I was from identifying landmarks and constellations, and cross referencing them with installations that had my building's floor plan (I had read a few books on developing an eidetic memory.  Not one of my best ideas, but it is handy sometimes.)  I found a couple local stores, stole some clothes and food, then lied my way into a hotel room for the night.  Again, remember, I had spent a large amount of time learning to manipulate people.  I then spent the night reading up about the local economy and housing, the stock market, as well as everything I'd need to fake an identity.
