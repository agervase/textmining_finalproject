The government, at this point, has written a special set of laws exclusive to me. They're posted on my front door in glaring, bold, red type.

I doubt that it would matter. They've tried killing me in the past. Tortured for months. Tested. Drowned. Thrown off of very tall buildings. It works every time.

I'm Mr. Trenchcoat, the world's foremost (and only) magician and necromancer. And I love what I do.

Patients get a choice nowadays about how they die. Some patients will pay extra for the chance to be impaled, poisoned, or to play with dangerous animals. Some patients' families will also pay extraâ€¦ But either way, I dredge on over to the underworld and bring 'em back. See, the thing is that maladies don't follow us into the afterlife. So all I gotta do is kill 'em, find 'em full and healthy in the underworld and bring 'em back. I mean, I used to kill my patients for free. What an idiot I was. 

I mean, I always wanted to be a doctor. They actually had me play a doctor on Scrubs, even though at that point I was already licensed. And just like the character I played, I got sent down to the morgue. A few hundred years before that I was tortured and killed incessantly, so I kinda had a hang of guessing how patients died.

But, this one day, out of the blue, I died in the morgue. And the patient was there with me when I went! I ended up finding him just a few doors down from my room where my spirit was put. All I had to do was take him into my room and we came back together.

Anyway, back to work. It's time to start the day. I've got my dead patient, a sheet for the blood, and a gun for me. Or maybe today I'll use the harpoon.
