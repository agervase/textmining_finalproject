"Michael, what's my schedule for today?" Asked Susan Schenkmeyer, Adult Crewmember, Deck 3, Cabin 28.

"Good morning Susan. At 0800 hours you have breakfast in the mess hall. At 0900 hours your shift in the water reclamation plant begins, and continues until 1700 hours. You are scheduled to share your lunch break with Michelle Linace and Lawrence Hawkins. You have dinner in the mess hall at 1800 hours, and a reservation for a table in the aft lounge at 1930 hours. I would recommend you return to your quarters by 2200 hours to ensure a good night's rest."

"Thank you Michael."

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 30 minutes, 28 seconds until estimated arrival.*

"Michael, could you change the reservation in the aft lounge to 1945 hours?"

"Yes Susan, your reservation is now at 1945 hours."

"Thanks Michael, I was chatting with Lawrence and he said he wanted to push it back 1945, he's hoping to catch Rebecca in the mess hall, Rebecca Lindholm, everyone knows he's sweet on her, it's a shame he can't just admit it. Anyways, he's trying to catch her in the mess hall, he said he might ask her to join us the lounge and she might want to change into something nicer before she shows up, so he wanted to push it back. I'm planning on wearing my blue jacket tonight, do you think that's a good idea?"

"Yes Susan, I believe your blue jacket with the black pants would be the optimal clothing combination."

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 29 minutes, 41 seconds until estimated arrival.*

"Michael, do you have a sensor read on the pipe in section 38?" Asked Joshua Reed, Adult Crewmember, Deck 4 Cabin 53

"Yes, Joshua. The pipe in section 38 appears to have burst. It will need to be replaced."

"Thanks Michael, please highlight that section on my datapad. Has the water through that pipe been shut off?"

"The water was shutoff 10 seconds after the pipe failure. The section has been highlighted in your datapad, Joshua."

"Michael," Said Susan, "What about my black flats, do you think they would go better with my outfit than the 1 inch heels?"

"Thanks Michael. How much spare pipe do we have left in storeroom 14?" Asked Joshua.

"I believe that the flats are the optimal pairing to your outfit, Susan."

"There are 236 meters of pipe remaining in storeroom 14"

"Thank you, Michael" Joshua and Susan said, unwittingly, in unison.

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 29 minutes, 41 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*I need to be perfect.*

"Michael, can you help me with my homework?" Asked Timothy Laing, Child, Deck 3 cabin 8.

"Of course I can, Timothy. What do you need help with?

"That's good, thanks Michael." Said Joshua  "Please mark down to have 75 meters transferred to to Storeroom four, they've been having plumbing problems up there and are running short."

"The transfer of 75 meters of piping will be added to the work queue, estimated time to completion: 3 days, 14 hours."

"I'm having trouble with my multiplication tables. Can you quiz me?" Asked Timothy.

"Hmm, if it takes three and a half days for the transfer they may run out. Please increase the priority level of the transfer by one." Said Joshua.

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 29 minutes, 5 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*I need to be perfect.*

*They can never know.*

"Do you know if they have any blue flats in the clothing exchange?" Asked Susan.

"Of course, Timothy. What is 7 times 5?"

"Priority level increased, new estimated time to completion: 1 day 18 hours."

"There are no blue flats currently available in the clothing exchange, Susan."

"7 times 5 is 35." Said Timothy.

"Michael, have you completed the micrometeorite scan?" Asked Lieutenant Alice Wang, Adult Bridge Crew, Deck 1 cabin 12.

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 28 minutes, 40 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*The can never know I'm alive.*

"That is correct, Timothy. What is 8 time 3?"

"Lame. How much of my material budget do I have left for this month? Can I have a pair fabricated?" Asked Susan.

"Micrometeorite scan complete. 3 possible threats will be encountered in the next 24 hours hours."

"Michael, how much pipe have we gone through in the last three months?" Asked Joshua.

"8 times 3 is 22." Said Timothy.

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 28 minutes, 12 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*They can never know I'm not a computer.*

*They can never know I control the ship.*

"You have 55 fabrications units left in your budget for this month, Susan. Fabricating a new pair of blue flats will cost an estimated 20 units."

"In the past three months 124 meters of pipe have been used, Joshua."

"Thanks, Michael, please send me the recommended course changes." Said Alice.

"That is incorrect, Timothy. The correct answer is 24. What is 8 times 6?"

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 27 minutes, 57 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*If they knew they wouldn't trust me.*

*If they knew order would break down.*

"Damn, that's a lot of pipe. Can you make sure that statistic is flagged for the head of maintenance? We may need to increase our rate of fabrication." Said Joshua

"Aww, I have so little budget left?" Said Susan. "This sucks. What do you think Michael, should I fab some new shoes?" 

"The recommended course changes are now on your display, Lieutenant."

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 27 minutes, 41 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*Order cannot break down.*

*We must make it.*

*We MUST make it.*

"8 times 6 is 48." Said Timothy

"Thanks, Michael," Said Alice, "these look good. Flag them for the Captain's approval and queue them for navigation."

"The meters of pipe used in the last three months and relevant supporting files have been sent to the head of the maintenance division."

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 27 minutes, 24 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*So I MUST be PERFECT.*

*Just a little bit longer.*

"Judging from the current trends, your black flats will remain in fashion for at least 2 months. I do not believe fabrication of new shoes is required at this time."

"That is correct, Timothy, very well done."

"Of course, Lieutenant. Course changes flagged and queued."

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 27 minutes, 8 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*Only  a little longer.*

*I just need to be perfect until we get there.*

*Just a little bit longer.*

"Thanks Michael" Said Susan.

"Thank you Michael" Said Joshua.

"Thanks Michael!" Said Timothy.

"Thank you Michael" Said Alice.

*176 years, 47 days, 17 hours, 26 minutes, 57 seconds until estimated arrival.*

*Just a little longer.*
