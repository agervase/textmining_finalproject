Isabel had just taken the girls to school, and I was finishing up with breakfast. Had several cases on my mind, but after the phone call with the judge last night, I felt better about how things would end up. He was a wise man, a fair man. 

There was a knock at the door. 

I wasn’t expecting anyone, and it was too soon for Isabel to be back. 

I got up from the table and approached the front door slowly. It was a damp, cold morning, the orange crisp leaves flooding our lawn and the sunlight soft and hazy. The prime of autumn. 

I grasped the doorknob and turned it slowly. With a creak, the door opened, and a few brown leaves blew into the house. A gust of cold air moved past me, and there in the doorway stood a man. Six foot two, black hair with a bit of gray, hard, worked hands, blue jeans, brown leather work boots, a red flannel shirt, and cold, dark brown eyes. He grasped a gallon of milk in his right hand, and his left in his pocket. He stared at me, and I stared at him. 

“Who are you?” He asked in a firm but soft voice. A red pickup truck was parked in the driveway. 

“I said who are you? Why are you in my house?” He asked, this time with more force. His left hand came out of his pocket, and he straightened his back, a tower of a man. 

“Dad?” I whispered. 

He looked at me with a face half peculiar and half angry. His gaze wandered into the house, and it was clear it was not as he remembered it. 

“Where’s Caroline? Where’s my boy?” He advanced. 

I stood there, staring at him but looking through him. He hadn’t aged a day. He looked at me, his eyes as cold as I remember. I saw a flicker of light in the darkness. It was then that he knew. 

“Dad... it’s me. It’s your son.” 

He stared, and I could tell he didn’t want to believe me. Tears swelled in his eyes. He knew. He could feel it. 

“...you’re all grown up... you’re my age... I went out to get some milk... it wasn’t even 50 minutes ago...” 

“Dad... it’s been 50 years...”
