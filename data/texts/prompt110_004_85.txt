Sean yawned and pulled into Cliche’s parking lot. The last two nights he’d pulled doubles to cover for Elyse, but now he couldn’t shake the phantom 20 pound dumbbells tied to his arms. Another day another dollar, he thought, pressing through the front door.

“Hey Sean. ‘Notha double tonight?” David asked, looking away from the Red Sox game on the far wall flat screen.

“Hey Dave. Yeah. You got a Red Bull for me under there?” Sean said pulling up a stool. It was 4 p.m., an hour before his shift, and the bar was empty, save for the three priests sitting and their bottle of wine at the corner table.

Dave cracked the can and said, “Here ya go kid. Drink up. You’re gonna need your wings tonight. Thursday nights are big. If you smile real nice for the people they’ll throw a bunch of green paper at ya.” A cynical smile curled at the corners of Dave’s mouth.

“Is that how that works? I thought I just had to show ‘em my freemason membership card.”

Dave turned back around. “Bullshit. You got a mason card?”

“Oh yeah,” Sean leaned to his left and reached for his pocket. “Check this out.” He pulled up a middle finger and chuckled.

Dave smirked and he door squealed open. Sean and Dave were greeted with the the sounds of hooves. Their owner, a 7 foot horse, pulled up to the bar a few feet from Sean.

Dave smiled, and leaned into the bar. “Hey bud, why the long face?”

The horse shook its mane out. “My wife just left with the kids.” Sean and Dave bore witness to the horse’s pause.

Sean started to speak. “I’m–”

“She took ‘em to the in laws for the weekend. I’m free.” The horse’s laugh was immense and the gravity pulled both Dave and Sean in. “A bourbon neat, thanks.”

Dave found a glass beneath the lip of the bar, wiped it out, and grabbed the Makers Mark off the wall. 1, 2, 3, 4. “That’ll be five.” Dave said, sliding the drink to his long-faced friend.
