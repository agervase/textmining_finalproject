***ROAR!!!*** A deafening cry rang out through the courtyard. To the untrained ear, it would sound like the challenging cry of a fierce dragon. The dragon's roar was enough to scare most people standing in the castle's open courtyard. Most every single person in the courtyard had expressions displaying varying levels of fear and worry. And who could blame them. When you hear a dragon's roar, that generally meant bad things were about to happen.

But there was one person in the courtyard who showed no such fear and no such worry. Instead, this person's face was scrunched up in exasperation and annoyance. Her ear was actually well trained - she recognized that dragon's "roar."

She was Princess Priscilla, who happened to have raised the particular dragon "roaring" from its birth. Unlike all the uneducated fools surrounding her, Priscilla recognized the "roar" for what it truly was, "a warning cry for help."

"Damnit. Not again." Priscilla grumbled. She stood up and started running in the direction of where the cry came from with a bevy of curses on her tongue. Her dear pet Norbert was in trouble. Again.

If she ever made it to the afterlife and met the person responsible for making knights believe that they must slay a dragon to rescue the princess, she would punch that person straight in the face. Just because a creature was massive, had teeth the size of daggers, tough scales that most weapons could not penetrate, and the ability to breathe fire, did not mean that creature was necessarily some terrible monster.

Norbert was the furthest thing *from* being a monster. He had the power to wipe out an entire kingdom, yet his temperament prevented him from harming a single fly. He was the gentlest creature she had ever met. Even when he protected her, he would opt to simply shield her with his mighty scales instead of using his fearsome power to fight back. An errant bee in the garden was more of a threat to her than Norbert. 

But that didn't stop ignorant knights from going after him because they assumed he was a threat to the kingdom's princess. They never once stopped and tried to understand her dragon, and because they didn't understand him, they feared him. 

She had been taking care of Norbert for 10 years now, and she had lost count of how many knights made an attempt on his life "on her behalf." Norbert never fought back a single time. Every single knight that had attacked him escaped unscathed (well, except for that fool that tripped over his clunky armor, fell and hit his head). 

***ROAAAAR!*** 

Priscilla cursed and started running faster. That cry meant that Norbert was getting scared. Whoever was currently attacking him must not be a slouch.

She idly cursed her father as she ran. She warned him that hosting all the knights in the castle grounds for a tournament was a bad idea. She told him one of the fools was likely to make a run at poor Norbert. Of course her father ignored her concerns. None of his knights would be "foolish" enough to attack a dragon unprovoked he said. She scoffed. At least 20 of his knights had attacked poor Norbert over the past 10 years. 

To make matters worse, she agreed to host a tea party in the courtyard for the knight's families and the various dignitaries that had traveled for the tournament. She should have stayed in the garden with Norbert.

***ROAAAAAAR!***

Priscilla broke into a dead sprint. That wasn't just a scared cry... that was a cry of pain. A pit formed in her stomach. Whoever the knight was that was attacking Norbert had to be remarkably strong to make her friendly dragon cry out in pain. Tears gathered at the edges of her eyes. If she didn't make it in time, Norbert could actually die.

She quickly blinked the tears away and did her best to ignore the dreadful pit in her stomach. Norbert didn't need a crying princess right now, he needed a strong and forceful princess. She shouldn't be *worried*, she should be *angry*. 

Priscilla focused on her anger as she rounded the corner. She was on the final stretch now. The entrance to the garden was in sight.

***ROOOOOOOAR!***

Priscilla grit her teeth in anger. How dare this knight. How dare he attack a peaceful, innocent creature with some deluded idea that it would "free" her and "win her heart." How dare this knight continue attacking her Norbert even though the poor dragon wasn't fighting back.

*I have to make it...* 

She burst through the entrance to the garden and her eyes widened at what she saw. Norbert was cowering in a corner with two horrible gashes across the wing he was using to try to shield himself. A knight decked out in his full armor was rearing back with a mighty great sword, getting ready to strike Norbert again.

"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!" Priscilla bellowed in rage, causing the knight to freeze in his tracks.

"Princess Priscilla?" The knight glanced over his shoulder. "You shouldn't be here. It's dangerous! Get back so I can free you from this terrible beast!"

"The only terrible beast I see here is you!" Priscilla growled. She fixed the knight with a glare that could stop even the bravest of men dead in their tracks. "How dare you attack Norbert! Back away from him **now**!"

"Norbert?" The knight dumbly parroted back. He looked between the princess and the "mighty" dragon (that was still cowering in fear in the corner).

"Norbert. His name is Norbert and he's the most magnificent creature this world has ever produced!" Priscilla put herself between the knight and the dragon.

"If you make one more move against this dragon, I will see you hanged."

"H-hanged?! Now wait a second, princess... I just thought..."

"You thought that I needed to be rescued from this terrifying dragon, right? That all you had to do was free me from this 'monster' and I would give you my hand in marriage?" Priscilla responded, venom lacing her voice.

"Well...uh... that's normally how it goes." The knight awkwardly replied.

"Norbert here isn't a monster. I've raised him from when he was a baby. He's the most gentle creature alive. Didn't it strike you the least bit odd that he refused to fight back? Didn't it strike you as odd when he opted to cower in a corner?"

"I just...thought my overwhelming strength terrified the foul beast." The knight quietly replied. He looked away from the princess with a look of shame.

"Men..." Priscilla snorted. "Just because you don't understand him doesn't mean he's a monster that needs to be slain. If you had tried to get to know him for even 30 seconds you would've realized how gentle he is. Sir Knight, people like you are the people I hate most in this world. I would sooner let the human race perish than marry you."

"I'm sorry to have offended you princess..." The knight said somewhat earnestly.

"I'm not the one you struck with that silly sword." Priscilla huffed. She turned around and flashed Norbert a comforting smile. "Everything is ok now, Norbert. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here and you had to go through that." 

The knight watched dumbfounded as the princess gently rubbed the dragon's neck, as one would rub the neck of a dog. He almost fell over in surprise when the dragon let out what sounded like a contented sigh as the princess comforted him.

Priscilla found herself calming down as Norbert did. She hated that this kept happening. She hated that this poor, sweet, gentle and innocent creature kept getting attacked on her behalf. But... she didn't sense any true malevolence from the knight behind her. The man was extremely misguided, but he appeared to regret his actions now that he knew the full truth. 

"The world is more complicated than black and white, Sir Knight." The princess softly said without taking her eyes off the dragon. "There are truly monstrous dragons out there, but that doesn't mean all of them are monsters. Please head to the castle and fetch our head dragon medic. This is a nasty wound that you left on Norbert, and I'm afraid I'm not well versed enough to fix it."

"R-right. Right away Princess Priscilla."

"And Sir Knight, do me a favor and spread this story to all of your fellow gathered knights. Poor Norbert certainly doesn't need any other dumb knights attacking him."

"Of course." The knight turned to run, but stopped himself. "Princess Priscilla, is this where Norbert usually stays?"

"It is. This is his favorite spot in all the castle grounds."

"Then I will personally stand guard over this garden for the rest of my stay here." The knight looked the dragon in the eye. "I am truly sorry for the trouble I've caused you, Sir Norbert. I give you my word as a knight that I will protect you."

"That's very kind of you, Sir Knight."

"I'll be back after I've gotten help for Norbert and spread the word about his true nature, Princess Priscilla!"

Priscilla watched the knight go with a strange sensation in her chest. Of the countless knights that attempted to take Norbert's life, that knight was the first to ever show regret. All of the others said she shouldn't trust such a "wicked beast," and that they would be around to "slay the monster" when she called.

For the first time in a long time, Priscilla found herself slightly hopeful. She had never witnessed anyone actually *change* when they learned the truth. Maybe that knight would be the first of many...

"What a strange knight, eh Norbert?" The princess quietly hummed as she stayed with her dragon friend.
