Just another daily commute. On at Junction 23 and off at 26. I've done it every day for the past 14 months or so, so I've gotten used to it. The radio is blaring its usual hourly propaganda stunt, you get used to ignoring it if you acknowledge it at all. They all share common themes - the war effort is glorious, the country is prospering, the enemy is in retreat. All the normal stuff. But this was different. The voice on the radio said "Attention, civilians! By lawful decree of Supreme Chancellor Sutler, the speed limit on all roads across Great Britain will be vigorously inforced! England Prevails!".

'England Prevails'. Every time 'England Prevails'. No new moto, just the same boring crap for the last 5 years. It makes you pine for the days of democracy. Nothing but Norsefire now. "England Prevails" I whispered, not even considering that I was saying it. What right do I have to complain anyway? I voted for the bastards.

The radio changes back to playing music and I quietly scoff at the radio set. "There aren't enough police in Britain to enforce laws on every road in the country. Just a bunch of rhetorical lunacy by Mr Sutler again".

A car pulls up alongside me, a silver MG. He speeds up to overtake me and just as his rear passes my front near side wheel, the car explodes into flames! "FUCKING CHRIST!" I shout, violently swerving to get out of the way of the out-of-control-and-also-very-much-on-fire vehicle. I plough into the barrier on the hard shoulder as the car veers into the central reservation. All the traffic behind me stops, some pulling onto the hard shoulder and some just stopping in the middle of the lane.

I open the door and fall onto the tarmac. A woman rushes over to me. "Oh my god, are you okay?"

"Yeah, I think I may have broken a toe or two." I rebutted.

"DARREN! DARREN! CALL 999!" she shouted.

"What's your name?" I asked her.

"Evey" she responded. "Evey Hammond"

"Evey. That's a nice name."
