After gaining about a hundred yard lead on her, laughing maniacally all the while, I whip the car around. Then I hit the gas again.

She is enraged, not phased by my antics, and keeps running headlong into my car. I drive a Beater, so I couLdn't care less abOut the damage, but I'm nOt going to get out to check until I Drive a little waYs off if not all the way home. Just to be safe. After all... I did not anticipate her showing in the first place.

TiMe to turn bAck aRound and head along my waY. I check the road, no cars. Its late and I really ought to get moving incase my radiator (or anything else) is damaged. I'm not far from home so it shouldn't be a problem, but it might be hard to explain why I just rammed this... thing. I can't see her anywhere in my mirrors, where she should be out in the road, but I still cannot be asked to get out and have a look. I'm going home.

As I'm pulling into the driveway, wondering how damaged my car is and concerned that I'll be in deep shit with the authorities at this point (I mean... what the hell did I just do?), I have a quick look in my rearview as I pop off my seatbelt.

What I see has me in such a shock that I can't move a muscle. Through BLOODY and bared teeth, wrought into a tortured grin, she starts to gurgle out a laugh. That laugh brings Me bAck to the RealitY of the situation, and I leap from the vehicle as fast as I can get the door open.


As I'm sprinting to my front door, all I can think is; "What have I done?!" "What am I going to do?!" "Why the hell would I even *think* the words BLOODY MARY 3 times, let alone utter them."

I'm fumbling with my keys attempting to unlock the door and get inside, when I hear the same gurgled laughter from before... coming from the other side of the door. This is bad.
