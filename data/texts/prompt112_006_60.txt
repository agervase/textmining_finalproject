I think it's been 15,000 years. Or at least, somewhere around that. I'm not really sure.  I haven't left the house in a few millennia at least. There's no point. All I end up doing is scaring a few people, and death goes on.  Besides, no matter where I go, it's crowded.

The space issue gets worse in the big cities, and don't even get me started on India and most of Asia. It isn't as bad in the remote regions of the world; Antarctica was only recently populated. I'd say 4000 years ago, give or take a few decades. 

15,000 years ago, I was caught in an apartment fire. I woke up and passed out within a minute or two. It actually wasn't that bad. Just a sore throat for a bit.  The living don't know it, but there is an after life. To reach it, all you have to do is pass out of memory. 

For the big guys like the pharoahs and kings, the great philosophers and warlords, it's been even longer. The trappings of history have bound them forever.  As long as there stands a museum dedicated to them, they remain.  They make for ok company.  

I was just a normal guy from a place that used to be called Virginia.  I should have been on my way a few decades after I died. It took me a long time to figure it out, but eventually it dawned on me and all of the other millions of lost souls.  

Being able to connect with everyone around the world instantaneously is awesome when you're alive.  If you're dead, a digital you is floating around out there, remembered eternally on the almighty internet. 

Most of us have accepted it, so we patiently wait for an apocalypse. We pray for the end of all things, and curse Mark Zuckerberg.
