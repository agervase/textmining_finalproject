-Sir, we wanna have a word with you!

-Go ahead, Ivan.

-We found the one! 42 hours in 3 days!

  Colonel Nikolai has the look of someone who saw a ghost. With trembling hands he puts his glasses on the table, slowly, trying to recollect his thoughts.

-There's gotta be a mistake!- a chinese man in a suit screams from a door in the other end of the room.

-You just don't want to accept that your stupid party ship plan is no longer required!-Lieutenant Ivan speaks up.

-Stop bickering, both of you!

  The colonel gets up, and walks with hands holding eachother on his back, stoping at a space ship smaller than a car.

-Ivan, send a search party to retrieve this man.

-Yes, sir!

-Dr. Lo, please leave the room.

 The chinese man exasperates and takes a deep breath.

-As you wish.

  The colonel passes his right hand on the space ship. A cleaning lady comes to pick empty glasses and shreded paper.

-Have you ever looked into the night's sky and thought how good would it be if you could reach them?

-Ah, yes. Yes, I did, sir.

-Stop thinking about it. Space is dangerous, but mostly boring. Everything is so far away from eachother. All you see once you're in the night's sky is more nights' skies. Just an infinite number of stars, separated by infinity. Our galaxy alone is so big is might just well have another in it's center, and we wouldn't even notice it. And when you reach a planet, all you find is sand. And a bunch of rocks, much like the ones you find on earth. Distracting the explorers wasn't enough. Sending many of them at once, to make a base, didn't work. This ship, that trades the capacity for one to move, read, or do anything other than pilot it, for a faster travel wasn't enough. Even Laika couldn't handle it. But now, we found a man who could travel in this ship. A man so broken inside even space wouldn't break him. I'm actually scared of meating such a man, scared at the thought of seing the abyss itself in his eyes.

-Colonel, you scare me when you say something like this. You should think that this marks the re-birth of the glorious USSR, that we, The Red Sons, ressurected it!

-Maybe Katrina. But aren't you worried that the pole that makes our flag stand higher is a man dead inside?
 

12 hours later, a search party finds the man. He didn't react the team invading his home, or to the flashlights. He didn't react to anything at all. He had no *external wounds*, and yet he was *dead*.
