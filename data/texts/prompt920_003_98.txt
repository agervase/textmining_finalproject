Tom lived in a small town in Connecticut, very religious town, in fact he was the only atheist.

One day he went to go out drinking with his buddies Chris, Steve and Ryan. Chris was a missionary, Steve was a priest and Ryan was a rabbi. They went to the bar and none of them drank except Tom.

The rest of the guys kept commenting on their religions and Tom, who is quite drunk at this point has had enough. *"Man you would all be better off if religion wasn't a thing."* All his friends got insulted and left him at the bar. 

Tom had to walk home and was so drunk that he stumbled in a bush. He got really upset and clicked his heels and said *"Man, I wish religion wasn't a thing."*

Silly Tom didn't know that whenever you click your heels anything that you ask will come true, so he was in for quite a surprise when he woke up at the dawn of man.

*"Holy fuck"* said Tom as he looked around to see trees and what seemed to be smoke.

Tom, being the curious guy, walked towards it to see a bunch of cavemen gathered around a fire and one on a rock, pointing at the sky. Tom, seeing the opportunity that he is being given, he picks up a rock off the ground and throws it at the man pointing at the sky.

The man falls flat on the ground and a puddle of blood pours. The cavemen are angry at Tom and gather around him, grunting.

All of a sudden, Tom faints and wakes up back in the bar with his buddies. To his surprise, they are all drinking. 

*"Holy fuckin' christ"* said Tom.

*"Stop talking about yourself Tom"* they responded.
