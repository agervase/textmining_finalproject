I read a theory once that if you lived forever, your perception of time would change. Events would come to flash by. A day would seem like an hour after long enough, then a few minutes, then a few seconds. It made me think immortality would suck, and you'd eventually go mad. 

It's been roughly twenty years since I agreed to be frozen in this tube. A ground-breaking experiment. They inject a special compound into your circulatory system and lower your body temperature way down to about 0.5 degrees Centigrade. The body keeps ticking away, just much, much slower. 

During this whole process, the going theory was I'd be in a sort of coma, my brain function being in a sort of hibernate mode. This however is not the case. I am awake. I can't feel my body, I can't even move my eyes, but I *exist*. 

My family used to visit. They'd bring me birthday cards and leave them taped to the glass. Maintenance would remove them after a while. Techs would visit sometimes, check the equipment, but I don't know how long it's been since the last came through. I wanted them to look into my eyes and see some glint of sentience. Nobody has yet. Just a last cursory look before they leave. Looking but not seeing. 

Sometimes I wish the machine would fail and let me slip away peacefully. I sleep when I can, although my mind feels 'soupy' for a long time after I wake. In these times I see things. Shapes. Things that scare me. It's like sleep paralysis, only it lasts for what seem like hours. 

I'm afraid. I'm afraid that one day the lights go off and never come back on. I end up as a living mummy, locked in a sarcophagus, waiting for an archaeologist to stumble upon me in a couple thousand years. I'm trying to keep my mind together, although the longer I sit here staring a wall, the harder it is to remain optimistic.
