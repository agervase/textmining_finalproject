Zoampa really missed hot coffee. A small pleasure yes, but even that would be welcome these days. He used to take his time before an introduction, finding a quiet diner somewhere nearby to sip coffee for awhile. Regardless of the land, he could always find a small diner serving coffee in the realm of the living, humans enjoyed those kinds of places. The acrylic had nearly worn from the table he sat at now. This place used to serve coffee, he was almost sure of it, but one could find nourishment here no longer. He turned his eyes to the miserable thing on the floor to his left. 

"You didn't find what you were looking for either, eh friend."

This job had been so similar to the others recently. Thirst, hunger, then collapse. This human even welcomed the introduction, Zoampa could tell. No more struggle, no more weariness, in this world at least. The time between these trips grew, and the taste had faded from his mouth. Other gods of death grew lazy, neglecting their vows, and he was beginning to see the appeal. Leaving the ruin, he read the sign by the Interstate,

**Green River**
 **Next Exit**

"Utah..."

He made note of the places he traveled to now, for he believed each visit would likely be his last. He opted to walk for awhile, rather than depart immediately. The town's namesake would have been beautiful to behold, had it still flowed or held any of the green that once lined its shores. A few miles further Zoampa found a horse, gaunt and not long dead. Its rider had died far earlier. He wondered if one of his brethren had been there to greet the rider. Walking along, he thought of the lives he shepherded centuries past. Vibrant and unique those lives had been, each bringing with it a story to be told to Zoampa and his kin's eager ears. He'd miss those stories, like he'd miss hot coffee.

Ready to depart, having filled his memory of this place, he made for the road. He then came upon something new. It was clearly new because the paint on the old tin had yet to fade. 

*Zion*
*food, water, refuge*
*260 miles Southwest*

"Zion...the world to come," Zoampa spoke aloud. "No need to leave just yet."
