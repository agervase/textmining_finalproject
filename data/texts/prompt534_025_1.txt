"Dude, you are going to need this!"He shook the handle at me.  The engravings looked intricate, but were oddly offset by the post-it note on the handle.  "Kill Janice" it read, in the kind of scribble you would use when writing in a hurry.

"Uh, okay." I said, taking a hold of the mythical weapon.  Dark energy thrummed down my arms, giving me the impression of anguished cries in some dark, solitary corner.

"I mean seriously," Death continued, as though in some kind of rush, "You wouldn't believe the kind of stuff they put me through."  He sat down on my doorstep, his tattered black cloak pooling in an unkempt pile on my scuffed 'Welcome' mat.

"You want to talk about it?" I asked, setting the scythe aside for now.

His breath whooshed out, whistling through his teeth and carrying a smell reminiscent of old books.  He hung his shoulders.  I thought I heard a quiet sob."Last week, I finished a project I spent three months on.  Three.... Fucking.... Months!  Then they just said that they didn't have the budget for it so they weren't going to release it into production.  That's after changing the requirements half-a-dozen times.  Meanwhile, I'm still responsible for answering all the support calls!  You get it, right?"

I nodded.  I worked software engineering at a large multinational. I knew the feeling.  A subtle, seething rage boiled up in my heart as I reached for the scythe.

"If you can get them in one hit, you won't lose your concealment." He said to my back as I walked off down the sidewalk.

"Make yourself at home," I replied, power from the scythe putting speed in my stride, "Beer's in the fridge, bottom drawer.  Remote is next to the couch."

"Thanks man," he said, his voice quiet.  "You've got no idea how much I appreciate this."

I didn't respond.  There was no need.

I'd make them pay for working him to Death.  Starting with Janice in Accounting.
