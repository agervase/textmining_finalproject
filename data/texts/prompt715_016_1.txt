Chapter One

Dead Man Walking

&#x200B;

‘I am so fucked.’

&#x200B;

Not the most romantic thing to say after making love; but then again, most people hadn’t just finished nailing the daughter of the High Priest of Necrosophy. All things considered, it seemed appropriate.

&#x200B;

‘I am so, so fucked.’

&#x200B;

It’s not that it wasn’t blindingly good (I think, it was hard to tell if any experience with her was actually enjoyable); it’s just that the idea of the grand leader of an illustrious cult whose entire purpose was to worship, study and master death, finding out I’d been rutting with his darling princess like we were animals in heat whose parents weren’t home struck me as a slightly unpleasant situation.

&#x200B;

Farmers chased you off their daughters with a pitchfork, blacksmiths with an array of home forged weapons, noblemen with a large bodyguard who doesn’t say much and is built like a wall of muscle that just finished a workout. All of these had chased me away from their daughters at some point and I’d been deft enough to make it away most times; if you were unlucky they caught you and beat some sense into you (the sense to not sleep with a woman in case she has a dad? I don’t know), and if you were very unlucky the worst they could do was kill you, that had obviously never happened to me.

&#x200B;

Necromancers, on the other hand? Now they were something else. A necromancer can chase after you, he can catch you, he can have his legions of undead minions rip you to shreds, but that’s not the worst of it. Necromancers can keep bringing you back to life and killing you again in a variety of different ways, and with how much they work with death they become quite desensitised to it. They’ll have you killed for spilling their tea, it’s no more than a backhand slap to them; so if the High Priest were to find out that I’d been having my way with his precious little girl (actually it was probably the other way around) then I could only imagine what manner of creative and gruesome deaths he’d subject me to, and I’d rather not.

&#x200B;

It was always going to happen eventually, I’d been enraptured from the first day I laid eyes on her; you see, in addition to being a necromancer she was also a powerful empath. Mere mortals, and a sizeable number of immortals, would have found it impossible not to be overcome by the deepest adoration of her. When first I saw her it was as if I suddenly realised that I had never seen real beauty before. Her hair was as dark as a raven’s feathers, flesh as pale as a crisp daybreak though the clouds, her eyes more piercing than the sharpest daggers, and she was garbed in a black and turquoise dress that adorned her body as if the gods themselves had looked upon her beauty and said “We cannot improve upon perfection, but we must try” and wove finery from their own heartstrings. Whether I actually cared about any of her features was irrelevant, they were hers, and so I adored them.

&#x200B;

After a week or so of seeing her as she visited her father I became desperate for her to have a repulsive personality, maybe after speaking to her I would find that my very skin crawled with her every word, perhaps I could learn to revile her and she would no longer occupy my every waking moment. No such luck, or perhaps right on the money, I couldn’t know. Either way I was happiest when I had the occasion to speak to her and eventually she took a shine to me herself. After maybe a month of chance encounters she asked me to go wandering off with her, away from the rest of the Necrosophers, just for a day or two at a time. I had no way of knowing if it was a good time, but it didn’t matter; for one reason or another I loved her, and that was all I cared about.

&#x200B;

On the last trip out she asked me if I loved her, I said ‘I’m powerless to do otherwise.’

‘You’re different than all the others,’ she said, ‘you’re really special.’

I bet you say that to all the acolytes you seduce I wanted to say, but I didn’t, I was too afraid that she’d say yes.

&#x200B;

‘You’re not fucked,’ she said, nuzzling into my neck, ‘well, not unless you want to be again, I think I could go for another-’

‘Will you please be serious with me, Selandria?’

‘Oh come on, how could daddy ever find out?’

‘Well let’s see, someone could have heard us, there could be gossip about us, you could be pregnant.’

‘...uh huh.’ For someone as adept at manipulation as she was, that was a very suspect reply.

‘What do you mean “uh huh”?’

‘Well… How much had you heard about me before we started seeing each other?’

‘Only the obvious gossip; you’re the High Priest’s daughter who he loves more than anything and he’s incredibly protective of you, you’re an adept necromancer and empath, they say the way to your heart is paved with the bodies of those who didn’t make it quite so far and they call you the High Priest’s deathly daughter.’

‘Oh, you thought it was deathly daughter. No no, you see I was sort of in an… accident when I was young. I’m sure you’ll have noticed this.’ She indicated a scar just above the swell of her left breast. I hadn’t, but now that she was showing it to me it added something, like depth of character to her body. Even imperfections seemed perfect on her.

‘How young?’ I asked.

‘Maybe nineteen years old.’

‘How… how old are you now?’ I asked, chancing the taboo.

‘Well, yeah, about that… you see, I say it was an accident, it wasn’t exactly… or really in any sense of the word... you see I was a little bit…’ the next word surprised me much more than it should have, ‘murdered. They don’t call me the High Priest’s deathly daughter, they call me the High Priest’s undead daughter.’

&#x200B;

I sat in stunned silence and tried not to think about whether that meant this counted as necrophilia. I failed.

‘So my point is,’ she said, ‘I’m not pregnant.’

‘Well that’s…’ good didn’t seem the right word, ‘adequate?’ In hindsight, maybe good wasn’t such a bad word after all. ‘Still though, if he’s somehow caught wind of our antics then I’m very much a dead man walking, and I don’t think there has ever been a more appropriate use of that phrase. You know what they say about all the other men whose bones you’ve jumped, and given the circumstances I’m begging you not to tell me how appropriate that phrase is.’

‘Will you stop it,’ she said, ‘daddy’s not like that, he’s actually a very reasonable man.’

&#x200B;

At that exact moment my lover’s calm and very reasonable daddy smashed down the door, reducing it to splinters, and entered the room flanked by what looked to be a pair of undead manticores; maybe he wanted to talk about the weather.

&#x200B;

‘Selandria!’ perhaps he was very angry about the weather. ‘What is the meaning of this? What’s this I hear about you galavanting off with yet another one of my acolytes? I thought we had been through this business enough times already. This is him I take it.’

‘Yes it is daddy, but you can’t kill everyone I end up in bed with.’

‘Of course I can, but that’s not the point. I may be antiquated in the most literal sense of the word but your appetites are no concern of mine; this is about your escapades away from home. If you really intend to run off to the furthest corners of the world then I wholeheartedly expect you to choose a suitor who can look after you.’

‘But he can look after me.’

‘Nonsense, now let’s feed this man’s entrails to the manticores and we can find you a warrior.’ I began to suspect that talking about the weather was not on the table.

‘But daddy, this one’s different, he passed the Necromancer’s Trial.’

‘Indeed?’ my prospective murderer replied. ‘Then perhaps I have underestimated him. Have him provide the usual tithe to the faith and we can discuss this matter further.’ He turned on his heel and left.

&#x200B;

‘You are a necromancer, right?’ she asked.

‘Well that sort of depends,’ I said, ‘does reanimating rats count as necromancy?’

‘You’re still on rats?’ she asked, bewildered. ‘Well, yes, I suppose that counts. How many rats have you reanimated?’

‘Do the early ones whose legs just twitched count as reanimated?’

‘Not really, no.’

‘Oh,’ I said, ‘well then no, I’m not a necromancer.’
