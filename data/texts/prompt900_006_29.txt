# The Daily Struggles of An Immortal

“Wait, what?” Lily exclaimed. “You spent thirty-seven years encased in a statue of Rixsus?! Isn’t that the Panysian god of male fertility?!” The orange colors of her irises were shifting wildly like eclipsed suns, which meant she was either upset, excited, highly amused, or aroused. I couldn’t tell which at the moment.

I sighed heavily, leaning back against the headboard of her bed, not wanting to remember the horrible memory. But Lily needed to know why keeping my immortality a secret was so important. After the incident with Freya kidnapping me to use as her personal blood-bag, I realized I had never told my girlfriend not to share. You would think that after sleeping with her for over six months, it would have come up.

But nope. I had been too busy focusing on other things that came up. So it completely slipped my mind, much to my regret.

And now I was receiving a daily visit from Freya, the supermodel with a vampiric superpower, so she could feed off of me. It was the deal I had gotten the villain chick to agree with in order to get her to let me go. Given other circumstances, I might not have minded our short time together every day. But she was ruthless in her feeding, completely tearing out my throat every time. At least she seemed to be enjoying herself, if her moans were any indication.

“Yeah,” I admitted, resting my hand on Lily’s thigh. She had moved next to me to lean against the headboard too. “It was about a hundred and eighty years ago. There was this villain who could create concrete with his body. He found out I was immortal and thought it would be funny to create a living statue.” I sighed again. “Ironically, I was freed when a super-couple were using the statue for their extracurricular activities. Needless to say, they were surprised when I popped out after breaking it.”

Lily’s eyes were glowing bright orange now, a subtle smirk on her face. If she was even remotely concerned about my well-being, she was doing a terrible job of showing it. “That’s horrible,” she said, soundly completely insincere.

“Hey, it’s not funny!” I sneered. “I couldn’t breathe for thirty-seven years! You don’t even know what that’s like!”

She was immediately apologetic. “I’m sorry." She took a deep breath. "I wish I had known. Then we wouldn’t have to put up with that slut.”

I glared at her. “Calling your friend a slut isn’t very nice.”

Lily immediately crossed her arms over her voluptuous chest and *humphed*. “I’ll call her what I want! I’m still considering frying her ass!” Her hair lit on fire then as if to illustrate her intention, but I knew it was just the manifestation of her sincere annoyance.

“Come on Lily, calm down. I really don’t feel like being scorched to the bone right now. It was kind of a rough day at work.”

She huffed in annoyance. “What? Because you found out Nick’s a man-whore?”

I shrugged. “I mean, I just never expected him to be the cheating type. He has a side-chick on top of his girlfriend who wants to marry him. Not to mention it’s so shocking considering how hideous the guy is. I mean come on, the average nerd looks like a male model in comparison.”

Lily tapped her chin with her finger, the fire on her head having died out. “Maybe it’s because he’s got super-strength. I’m sure that has perks in bed.”

I glared at her again. “Don’t even go there. I do *not* want that visual.”

She did a fake gagging as she replied. “Yeah, actually I don’t either.” She then unexpectedly ran her hand along my chest. I thought she was showing me affection until she pinched me *hard* with a glare. “This Freya situation better not turn into *you* having a side-chick, or else I’ll fry *your* ass!”

I smirked at her. “Trust me, you're a handful all on your own.” I then reached up to illustrate what I meant, causing her to grin and lean in for a kiss, reminding me again why being immortal wasn’t so horrible after all.
