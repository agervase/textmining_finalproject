"T-this is an emergency alert." A frantic raspy voice took over the television you were reading. "Something has gone wrong. Terribly wrong. Barricade all entries to your home." the voice of the man let out a groan. "do NOT go outside after sundown. Restrict contact w-with others." the soft thump on a metallic surface could be heard in the background. "do not enter ANY tunnels during daytime. Do not make ANY light or noise from 6 PM and 8AM. Stay inside untill dawn." the thumping got louder as the pump of a shotgun was heard. "military aid is unavailable. Good luck." He sighs as a door gets forced open sending the barricade crashing down as an inhuman scream fills the air before getting cut off.

 You sat paralyzed. Just as the man said the audio was repeating over a blank screen. You open your phone and stare at the time, 5:54PM. If what was said was true you'd find out in 4 minutes. You slowly stand up and shift over to the window and stare outside. A line figure stood with it's back to you. It was obviously a male human but it's skin was white and it's body was twitching wildly. You duck and hide as it turns seemingly too fast without knowing you were alredy there and curse yourself for staring so much. After a few more minutes the power goes out. You look at your phone again and try to call your family but fail likely as many others at the same time.

The white skinned beast was nowhere to be seen when you stood up the next time. You locked the doors to be sure they couldn't easily get in, and waited. If the power came back on in the morning you'd make quick work if making a better position d hope many others will to. But as you thought that the scream happened again. A loud, obnoxious, bone chilling scream followed by the scream from your neighbor. You heard a few rounds go off before silence, all except for the banging of these... Things running around.
