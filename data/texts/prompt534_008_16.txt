Finally! I've been waiting for this day since I was born. The day that I'll be granted an incredible power. I was ecstatic at the thought of receiving my own power that I can use for my own leisure. 

'I'll show my brother that mine will be better than the lightning that was granted by Raiden!  Perhaps I would even surpass my sister who got a bow from Apollo!' I opened the oak wood door and was greeted by a mysterious figure, staring down at me. **"Are you..........?"** 

I froze. I couldn't understand what he just said, I tried asking him to repeat but all I got was **"Sorry, this was your name in our language."** Language?  This being had their own language? By the deities! Even the elves had simpler language than this. I mustered my courage and asked him**"Who are you?"** ..........Nothing it said nothing but only a chuckle

It then conjured a scythe out of thin air which gave a deathly aura to it. Something clicked in my mind. He was-- **"You're Death himself aren't you? "** He put the scythe in my hand and simply said this with a monotone voice **"Yes, I am Death itself, the other gods and deities has been pestering me to finally have a mortal inherit my power. So I did, you will be my champion and use my power for your own leisure.""

I hold the scythe in my hands, the handle was made out of ebony and the scythe was made out of sharpen bones. **"But why me?  Why grant me this.......Disastrous power? You could have choose a disciple of an assassin."**

 He looks at me for a while before conjuring an illusion around us. An illusion of assassinations, including the asassination of the emperor, a common beggar and a noble. **"Assassins......They kill when ordered too.  My reapers and I kill when a mortal's time is coming to an end. Same concept yes? But assassins broke one of our law,  which is killing even when their time hasn't come yet. The same goes for necromancers who ressurects their loved ones or their pets. I found it disgusting that they tamper with life and death like it's some toy. But when I saw you, I know you can handle my power easily.**"

At this point, I was beyond confused. Me?  I'm just a dumb 18 year old who lives on their own because they didn't want to burden their parents! 
**"Why though? Surely your eyes has wronged you."** He sighs before taking off the hood of his cloak. His face was not a skull but instead it was a black mist with dark violet glows for eyes. **"I know those who are worthy when I see one. And you?  You're the most perfect mortal for the job. Trust me in this for I would never lie to you. After all, they do say death was a hurtful lie did they not?**"

I glanced at the scythe and hold it with both of my hands. I could hear screeching of souls who have sinned, cries of those who missed their living loved ones, relief of those who taken their own lives and those who are calm knowing their time has ended. Dark markings appear under my eyes and I learned what he has called me in his language.

He called me

***The emissary of Death, Demise.***
