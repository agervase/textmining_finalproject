There was a 'ding' and people in the plane bolted up from their chairs and started opening the overhead bins as if they were treasure chests. I stayed seated.

"Get up," he growled. He flicked his bottom lip under his two front teeth, a nervous habit I'd noticed in our 72 or so hours together. I turned and looked at him, failing to hide my hate.

"Let him go."

"Put your foot on the ground, and he's free."

"I don't trust you. Let him go first." 

"Not gonna happen. Get up."

"What are you going to do, kill me? If you do that, it won't work, right?"

"We'll kill him, too. I don't think you'll find your sacrifice worth it."

He was right. Besides, he'd just drag me off the plane, or he'd just have some cops do it. 

Part of me wondered if there was any chance this was real. It had been a whirlwind--4 continents in 3 days. We'd get off the plane, walk out of the airport, find a patch of actual soil or grass, I'd step on it, and we go right back into the airport. I was in Cairo for an hour and a half. I always wanted to see Egypt.

"Let's play two lies and truth," Josh had said on our second date. His green eyes flickered gold in the low bar lighting, his collared shirt and V-neck sweater giving him the perfect amount of preppy style. 

"What's that?"

"So. I am in the Guinness book of World Records. I once saved someone in a fire. I have assisted the CIA in an investigation. You have eight questions to determine which of those is true. You get it right, I have to drink, you don't you drink."

I smiled. For one, I already knew he had a world record. He'd posted about it 3 years ago on Facebook, and maybe I was a little excessive in my pre-first-date stalking. 

"What's your world record in?" I asked. 

"Most blinks in a minute." 

I looked at his eyes closely. He batted his eyes as a woman in a silent film might do to flirt. 

"That was pretty fast," I said.

"I haven't even warmed up." 

I laughed. His lying was pretty impressive for the falsehoods: the person he saved from a fire was a woman in a car accident, and he and a group of people had pulled her from the burning wreckage. That had been in Philadelphia. The CIA investigation wasn't as sexy as it sounded--he had confirmed he had been on the subway that morning, but he didn't really remember the man in the picture they were showing him. I pointed out that didn't really count as 'assisting' in an investigation. 

After he finished chugging his beer and gesturing to the bartender for a new one, he looked at me. "Your turn," he said. 

I smiled. "Okay," I thought for a moment. "I have never eaten McDonald's. I only have one lung." I paused for a moment, as if I were thinking of a lie. 

"And I was born in Antarctica."
