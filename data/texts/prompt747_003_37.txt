The painting pulsates of blood.

That's what happens if you mix art and blood magic. You might think to yourself: "That's rad!". Firstly, who uses rad anyway? And secondly no. It's not.

&#x200B;

Think of the mess it makes. It's a damned blood leaking vein. Eventually, somebody has to clean it. You can't leave that much blood all around for long, it attracts demons. And that's the last thing you'll want. Especially when you're naked, high on a unicorn poo and thinking you just purged the world of evil.

&#x200B;

The sad part about this story is that eventually, unicorn poo leads to a terrible hangover. Take a moment to factor that into the equation that I just presented to you. Ain't it a crappy situation to be into?

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The emerald moss on the wall kept stealing his glance. He wondered how something colorful can sneak into that stink hole. Streets around him were all of a heavy grey.

Everybody kept their heads down, making themselves small and moved at a constant pace. Not even a glance of a beggar standing in the street. They knew that people in these parts have no money to spare and on top of that, they can end up into unwilling involved in some strange ritual.

Arcania was the biggest city in this part of the world. While not the capital of the dominance, it was the center of trade. These kind of places are where you'd want to be since here is where the money flows in streams and all you need is a bait good enough to fish it. But not everybody had the luck to be in the actual city, the uptown. Down here, in the slums, their corruption and ignorance for others leaked to form sewage of humanoid filth. Even the lower paladin force didn't bother to police the area.

&#x200B;

So naturally, what ruled was the ancient law embedded in our fiber: an eye for an eye. As long as the wheel of revenge kept spinning, there was relative peace and safety. Nobody wanted to deal with a cousin that it somehow happens to be a rejected paladin or worse, a monk. Moreover when black arts were the weapon of choice for many around here.

&#x200B;

The same story was with him. Karelle' was his name and his weapon and tool was necromancy. Not many liked the art, it meant dealing with dead people. Not only their eyes are cold enough to freeze all the little joy you held in your heart, but they also tend to stink fast. But this meant less competition on the market.

&#x200B;

Early today, he received a call from an elf. An ancient body from the neighboring country-continent happened to be in his master's possession. In his view, the elves were the worst. They were more scum than humans, and even than dwarfs. While dwarfs, in their fancy suits, looked down on you, elves looked up at you. In their eyes, you were their fruit to squeeze all the juice out off. Always nomads. And always filthy in Karelle' eyes.

&#x200B;

"E wassa. Dear lordy boy, the body is this way" the tall slim elf opened the steel door from a dark alley.

"Tell me why again you require my aid with resurrecting this body? It won't be cheap"

"E lordy boy, don' worry bout the juice. Y master have plenty ya know. He collects items o' rarity an that old stinker is rare as ya get. Y never understou the fascination. A look that here, 'int it shitty?"

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

The ritual for an old body like that was incredibly complicated, long and financially draining. The ingredients you need for the spell are absurdly priced.

But Karelle', while not talented in choosing inspiring life paths, he was certainly talented at necromancy. Because of the stated of degradation, you needed to construct a viable vessel out of carbon. The cheapest compatible form available was trent charcoal, so the bodies reanimated this way were pitch black. People called them shades.

&#x200B;

At the first sign of the ritual having success, when the body first twitched, the elf flinched from his light slumber and dashed away from the room. Karelle' grabbed the black cold hand and helped the vessel raise, while a joyous smile of satisfaction kept lingering on his tired sweat ridden face.

&#x200B;

"Welcome back to this world. Unfortunately, as you might or might not know, you died. Quite a long time ago. So don't panic when you see yourself differently. You are, after all, an animated body, bound to my will. So tell me who were you in your life?"

&#x200B;

"Bob Ross" the shade spoke without a sign of emotion.

&#x200B;

"Bob Ross, what a silly name. Well, Bob. Tell me. What did you do in your life?"

"I brought joy into people's hearts."

&#x200B;

"How so?" Karelle' puffed a small laugh.

"I taught them how to paint" the shade responded again without a sign of emotion, though Karelle' could fell some sort of a deeply rooted pride down below the words

&#x200B;

"Now that's silly, painting didn't make anyone happy ever. All the artists I know, eat scrap and barely survive. Dwarves have no taste for art, so almost nobody that can afford it has." Karelle' spoke with melancholy while letting his glance into the floor

"You seem to be saddened deep inside. You should try to be happier. There are no truly sad people in the world. The brush strokes I helped take life, they changed the world for the better. It takes time. But trust me. Find the thing that's inside you, take it out of you and paint a beautiful picture with that. Have some fun! You'll see how the world around will start to change for the better. "

&#x200B;

"Tha- "

"I think we're done here. Take your gold necromancer and flee my sight!" a tall handsome man entered the room throwing a cloth bag on the floor. Here wore an expensive green suit, made of emerald wool fiber. Like a moss in a sea of grey, Karelle' though to himself. Humans who were rich were rare, but the dwarves tolerated their success as long as they don't become an interference for them.

"I'm glad to assists." Karelle' said picking the bag. "The shade her-"

&#x200B;

"Did I asked you a question?! Begone already!"

&#x200B;

Karelle' looked down and rushed out while cursing in his mind. Outside he counted the money. A quarter was missing. It barely covered the costs. He wanted to rush back in and destroy everything around. But his cowardice was more powerful than his irrationality. So he turned and left. On the way to his tiny apartment, a few blocks away, he thought how deranged the world around was. He hated everything. The sidewalk. The city. Himself. Not to say his apartment.

&#x200B;

From the moment he unlocked the enchanted steel door to the couch he wanted to tear the place apart. He hated it. Then he realized he had some leftovers from the ritual. Among them was unicorn poo. While a potent spellbinder, it was also a very powerful hallucinogen.

He grabbed the leftover and shove it in his mouth. "Sweet, why does it even taste sweet?". Letting himself sink in the couch Karelle' kept pondering at what the shade spoke. There was a time he loved to paint. A useless skill, his mother bragged, but his father wanted the kid to be a little happy. Maybe that's why eventually his mother left. The sad part is, in the end, he found her words true, painting is a meaningless activity.  He might even still have a canvas around the closet.

&#x200B;

Suddenly the unicorn poo kicked in. Like thunderstruck, with tears in his eyes, he jumped on his feet. An epiphany struck him

" The old bugger was right! I will take what's inside me and will paint a painting so powerful that will change everything. I WILL PURGE THIS WORLD OF EVIL! LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!"

Karelle' grabbed a knife and rushed to the closet.

&#x200B;

There he found a blank canvas.
