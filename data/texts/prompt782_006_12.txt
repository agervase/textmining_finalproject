"Come in"

A young man, no older than 20 entered the office. An unnusual place for someone with cancer. You would think more something like a hospital, but no, just a regular old medical office.

"Hi, uhm.. i had an appointment for 12:30" he uttered.

"Ah, Andy Rowan?" I replied casually. He looked very normal, brown hair, brown eyes, average physique.. he was so average, he almost seemed extraordinary *because* everything about him was so normal

"Y-yeah." He was visibly anxious. I mean, how could he not be? He was literally about to die. For a short while, granted, but you never know what you will see on the other side for the short duration you are there. Maybe that's why he was scared.

"What seems to be the problem here?" I asked him, already preparing a few things i need for the ritual. I didn't even need to know what was wrong with him, ***he*** would cover me on that.

"I was diagnosed with cancer recently, i have a tumor in my left arm, so.. i heard you can help me?"

"You know whats about to happen, don't you?" A suprising amount of people dont, which is why i always have to ask them. It's always awkward to have to tell people that im going to have to kill them. Unsuprisingly, there has never been a person to continue with the 'procedure' once i tell them how it goes.

"..Yes." Luckily, he did know.

"Needle or pill?" I asked while searching around my drawers for a lighter.

"What?"

I look up at him "Should i inject the cyanide with a needle or do you want to swallow a pill? I got water here if you choose the pill."

"Oh, uhm.. i guess i'll take the pill."

I hand him a glass of water along side the pill and instruct him to lay down and think of nice things once he swallowed it. While he copes with dying, i set everything up. They usually aren't supposed to see this, but ***he*** can make them forget it all easily.

"Oh, and one more thing-" I looked up, only to find him dead already. Well, not dead, he was probably still concious and currently going into cardiac arrest, but he wasn't in any condition answer, let alone hear me. Maybe he just wanted to get it done quick. Most people still think that cyanide kills quick and painless. But thats not true. And my patients don't need to know that.

I finish setting everything up; The symbols are written, the candles are lit and the shutters are closed. I pull up the ancient texts and start reading the hebrew lines. A familier shadow creeps into my peripheral vision, but makes it's way past me and toward the young man.

"Erase his memory of the ritual too, Azrael." The devil isn't the only one you can make deals with, you know?

The shadow completley covered the boy, devoiding the rest of the room of light as well. It takes a while, but thats my job. I made a stupid deal as a teenager and now i've got to make the best of it. Im not a very patient person, but i can take five minutes.

The time passes and light floods the room again, no trace of the shadow anywhere. I go to slowly wake the boy, shaking him by the shoulders gently until he wakes up.

"How do you feel?" I wonder what he saw. Azrael seemed neutral on this one.

"Really good doc. Thanks!" He seemed happy, euphoric even. Most people don't react that way. Most people are slightly depressed after the 'procedure'. It's good to see that there are still people who make it to the promised land. As he walked out of the office, i couldn't help but think about my inevitable fate. This is just what happens when you sell your soul. But before i could dwell in my fears of the future, the next person knocked on the door already. After all, it's just another day at the office.

Alright, i have never, EVER written a story before. I just liked reading the ones that other people on this sub wrote. I just kinda.. sat down and wrote this. Gave it a little thought, and put whatever this is together. So please, tell me how i could improve, i might actually just keep doing this because it was pretty fun. English isn't my first language so i might need to edit some spelling and gramatical errors.
