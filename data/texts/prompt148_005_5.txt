“Unicorns are hard to come by these days mate,” Kaski said while shifting through some files in cabinet under his office desk. Nicholas with a grin on his face waiting for  Kaski to continue let out a faint “but.....”. 



Kaski: “but....... they do exist lad, only issue is they’re few and far between” 



Nicholas: “c’mon you lazy Brit, it’s not for me..... it’s for my daughter, I know there’s one in West Africa, heard rumors from village locals when we were hunting the Rihnoppolis.” 




Kaski: *sets down the file* “there was one in West Africa, it was killed back in 95 by the RUF during the Sierra Leonean civil war, fucking death cult cunt’s used its blood as an aphrodisiac.”




Nicholas: *upset* “so there’s no more left?”





Kaski: “oh there’s one....... but you’re not going to like it” 




Nicholas: “hey ones all I need, just tell me where, somewhere else in Africa?”




Kaski: ”Nope”





Nicholas: “Asia? Europe?”



Kaski: “Nope” 





Nicholas: “C’mon man level with me, the America’s?” 




Kaski: “Nope”




Nicholas: “Well where else can it be b....... NO NO NO” 




Kaski: *Grinning* “OH YES”




Nicholas: “Please no we can’t go back there” *Nicholas looks down to see Kaski’s Robotic leg and scarred facial tissue* 




Kaski: *Turns over unicorn file to reveal a map of Australia* “CORRECTION..... I can’t go back there, not after what happened last time.... I’m an old man now, my monster hunting days are behind me. But if you really need the one last remaining unicorn it’s out there”





Nicholas: *stops to ponder* “I’m going to need a team”




Kaski: “I know a few mad lads in need of adventure, I’ll arrange everything. Plane leaves in a few days..... be on it, and take this” *Kaski hands Nicholas a large duffle bag* 


[A few days later inside the interior of a cargo plane nearing the Australian outback]

Nicholas: *armed in tactical gear with submachine guns along with five other professionals* “Okay Diego and Pedro are with me on point because their ex Mexican special forces, specialized in close quarters combat, Ben take the Radio and call in air support if we need it, you’re behind us. Take this tranq rifle for when the time comes.” *hands rifle to the Ex US marine* 

Pedro: *sharpening a machete* “what’s with all this extra gear if we’re just going to knock the damn horse out?”


*Pedro is interrupted by Ishmael, an Ex IDF sniper* 


Ishmael: “Believe me, that horse is the least of our problems once we hit the ground......... there are things down there..... unholy things” 


Nicholas: “Exactly, that’s why Ishmael along with Ghui are protecting our six” 


Ghui: “I didn’t serve with the South African artillery Corp for three years so I could be stuck on guard duty” 


Diego: “relax compadre, you will see your share of action soon enough” 


Pilot: “PREPARE TO DROP, WE ARE NEARING THE MYSTICAL QUARTER”
*green jump light turns on*


*Nicholas Jumps* 


*Diego jumps*


*Pedro Jumps* 


*Ben jumps* 


*Ishmael jumps* 



*Ghui jumps* 






*a loud screech is heard as the squad looks up to witness a pterodactyl tearing through the cockpit* 




Pilot: *in cockpit* “AHHHHHH *pulls pistol firing a few shots off before being thrown from the plane and eaten by another pterodactyl*




Diego: *aims submachine gun and fires a burst nocking both pterodactyls out of the sky* 



Ben: “Well there goes our air support” 




A few moments later our protagonist all regroup on the ground between some rocks and a few dry dying trees. 



Ghui: *freaking out* “WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?” 



Diego: *reloading* “a Pterodactyl” 



Ghui: “I know that but how the fuck is it here?” 



Nicholas: “This is your first time in Australia isn’t it?” 



Ghui: *still freaking out* “yes”




Nicholas: “Australia isn’t like the rest of the world, some may say it’s a pathway to a realm long............... forgotten” *Nicholas peaks his head above a rock to see a valley filled with mystical and prehistoric-creatures* 



Pedro: “jefe, necesitamos movernos, it’s not safe to stay here for any amount of time” 



Nicholas: “Yeah you’re right, Ishmael and Ghui stay here, cover us from this position, the rest of you move into the valley” 



*Nicholas leads Pedro and Diego into the valley with Ben trailing closely behind*



Ishmael: *via radio* “Nicholas I see the unicorn it’s 212 North East by the large tree” 



Pedro: *confused* “big tree? I don’t see a..”



Diego: *interrupts Pedro* “THATS NOT A TREE”



*A giant crab like creature springs from the ground unburying itself from the dirt as it crabs Pedro in its claws crushing him half to death*




Nicholas: *aiming submachine gun* “OPEN FIRE” 



Nicholas and friends fire at the large crustacean as it slowly crushes Pedro to death. However it looks as if bullets have no effect, with only Ishmael sniper rounds makings and noticeable damage and even then not by much. 




Pedro: *barely conscious, pulls the pins of his grenades while in the crabs clutches* “buenas noches camarones” *he whispers* 




*BOOOOOOOM* the large explosion blows the crabs arm off as it scurries away deep underground. 



Nicholas: *with a tear running down his face* “WE NEED TO GO NOW” 



Nicholas, Diego and Ben move quietly through the valley nearing the fabled unicorn. 



Meanwhile at the lookout with Ishmael and Ghui.



Ishmael: *reloading his 50.* “think that crabs dead?” 



Ghui: *still freaking out from the pterodacty’s* “I don’t fucking know” *ghui wonders off a few meters before seeing a glowing white figure* 


The white figure grew closer resembling a also transparent female 




Ghui: “WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?”



*the spirit vanished* 



Ishmael: *looks back* “what’s what? Nothings out there, focus on the valley”




Ghui: *looking back at Ishmael* “I could have sworn I saw something”




Ishmael: “The fights in the other direction friend, don’t go crazy on me now” *Ishmael said jokingly before looking back through his rifle not paying any more attention to Ghui* 




Ghui: *steeps sway from Ishmael* “but I could have sworn i....* 



The white female spirit appears again with red eyes and begins to whisper in Ghui‘s ear “Kill them and I’ll set you free” 



Ghui: *freaking out* “NO NO NO, Get out of my head” 




Meanwhile Nicholas, Diego and Ben see the unicorn drinking out of a pond near a large hollowed out tree.



Nicholas: *looking through binoculars* “can you take the shot?” 



Ben: *aiming tranq rifle* “probably” 



Diego: “somethings definitely alive in that log though” 



Nicholas: “be ready with the submachine guns Incase the shot wakes something up” 



Nicholas: “3.....2.....1”


*Bang* Ben shoots the unicorn in the neck as it jumps back and forth a bit before falling to the ground* 



*Just then a swarm of Emu’s come running out from the log gaining ground rapidly as Nicholas and Diego hold them off with submachine guns*



Nicholas: *gun clips empty* “I’M OUT” *switches to a pistol killing serval more emus* 




Diego: *throws a magazine to Nicholas* “Make it count it’s my last one” *fires his remaining mag in one hand while swinging a machete in the other, cutting several emus in half* 



Soon the emus are driven back with the stragglers being picked off one by one



Ben: *smiling ha see they aren’t that to....* *BANG*, Bens head gets blown off from a sniper shot as his lifeless corpse falls to the ground* 



Diego: *Jumping behind a rock with Nicholas* “WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?” 



Nicholas: *peaks over the rock with binoculars revealing that Ghui is manning the 50. Rifle while Ishmael is dead on the ground next him with his throat slit* 




Nicholas: “The South African went crazy, stabbed Ishmael, shot Ben and is trying to kill us!!” 




Meanwhile back at the lookout Ghui is struggling with the white spirit and her mental manipulation, Ghui is able to break free for a short time as his red eyes return to normal. 


Ghui: *Crying* “OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE” *the spirit re-enters his mind but freezes up as Ghui uses his last bit of mental strength the pull a revolver up against his temple* “LETS DIE TOGETHER” *pulls trigger killing himself, leaving the spirit trapped forever* 




Diego and Nick look back at the corpses of Ghui and Ishmael. 



Nicholas approaches the unicorn and pulls the dart out so it can stand up.



Nicholas: *whispering to the unicorn* “get us out of here or we all die” 


Nicholas and Diego hop on the back of the unicorn and escape the valley just as the crab creature emerges from the ground to feast on the remains of Ben, Pedro, Ishmael and Ghui. 





[weeks later Nicholas is at home on Christmas Day with his family] 

Nicholas: “Here you go” *opens the shed door to reveal a actual unicorn*


Nicholas’s Daughter: “OH MY GOD, I love it!!!”



Nicholas’s Wife: *shocked* “What did this cost?”


Nicholas: *pulls out a small picture of Himself, Ben, Diego, Pedro, Ishmael, and Ghui all in the plane before the drop as a tear falls down his face* “everything”
