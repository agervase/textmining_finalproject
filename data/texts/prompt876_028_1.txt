I felt weightless. Simple existing in space, watching the cloud cover rise up around me, eventually giving way to a city of white marble hidden among the white waves. I felt a new sensation, gravity returning, as I hurled toward the distance ledge of a white stone landing. My feet landed, and the world fell back into place. Except, this was not the world I once knew.

*I must be at the gate of St. Peter*, I thought to myself. Something, now, seemed off. There were black and red smears of color everywhere, coming into focus. The longer my eyes lingered, the more detailed these demarcations became. The gate itself, which still maintained an aura of power, was desolated, all that remained were two broken arches.

I trudged forward. And the bodies appeared. One after another. Not winged or robed as one might remember, but dressed as if it were just any other sunday. Button up shirts, long summer dresses, polished shoes, baseball hats, anything you could imagine. And what I noticed next was even more disturbing.

*I knew these people.*

I knew all the people I passed. Cousins, old acquaintances, new friends, ex-lovers, forgotten relatives, all scattered around the marble laden halls, all the victims of a cruel fate. But I trudged forward.

*I already met death once.* I thought to myself, trying to steel my resolve. *How can any of this be real? I just saw Kevin yesterday. And Joe moved to Colorado over 20 years ago. I haven't even spoken to him in 10. And Cathy...there's no way she could even be in the same state as me...*

My thoughts carried on in this way, as I passed more and more persons and victims, alike, who shared this desolate plane of existence with me. Without warning, I came upon a long set of stairs, and felt possessed to ascend.

At the top, there was a lone seat. On it, a man, old as time, beard white as the marble around him, stained black and red as the marble had been. I approached him, feeling a calm fall over me as I did, followed shortly by a keep sense of dread.

I knelt in front of the small corpse, put my hand on his shoulder, and felt a cold wave wash over me. I remembered what I felt like to be small, to be saddened by a tragic event larger than life, and feel powerless to stop it.

I went to mourn; I felt no feelings of mourning emerge.

I reflected upon my life, and realized a short but simple truth.

*I populated this land. I left the corpses of my friends and family in my wake, had no empathy for the weak and no sympathy for the suffering. I put myself first before everyone else, and left everyone behind to die or suffer without my help. In the end, I even denied the possibility of an all powerful. Just so I can sit atop a throne myself.*

I push over the frail body, sat on the charred throne, and looked over my kingdom.
