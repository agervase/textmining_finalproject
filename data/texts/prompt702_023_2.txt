The fear gripped me, tearing me from sleep. My god. Serum 9. Leaping from bed I tear down the empty hall, my legs weak and shaking from sleep or the Beast which wound its way around my veins. I could feel the cold and tiredness set into me as I ran down the street to my Toyota. Panic shoots through me as my third alarm rang on my phone, I realise I'm far to late. My body becomes rigid and I fling out my arms in terror. My breath now shallow I have a few seconds to think. My god. I would never fall in love. An eighteen year old boy and I would die in the grey city. I kick myself for not stealing my friends pill when I had the chance. I stop, my knees collapse and I faceplant the hard kerb. As my nose shatters on impact I am thankful for the pain. I feel as though I can fight the numbness climbing from my extremities. I snort blood, my eyes start to close, heart slows down, breathing stops. Warm blood drips down my chin and I stop thinking of myself. I can't fight this. My mum, my poor mum. This happened to my sister only a week ago. A slow, lethargic tear rolls down my throat. My muscles spasm and tense before my legs bend and my arms push my structure up. I do not feel strong. I am not in control. I begin to walk away, down the street and towards the gold, glowing building in the distance. I live less than a mile from the Factory. My body drags itself towards eternal slavery along with ten or so others from my town, FactoryTown Four. I may not be dead, but working for the Factory is worse than death. Conscious and seeing, but trapped inside your own body until it breaks down and walks itself to an incinerator. Then you burn alive. All because you cant afford Serum 9.
