*Not again*, I thought to myself, as I let out a hopeless sigh.

Ever since I set foot in that bloody temple, I've had nothing but bizarrely magical experiences. It sounds like something out of a Disney flick, but no, this was something much less exciting and much more annoying.

*How will I introduce myself this time? Should I scratch at the door? Make stupid hissing noises as if I was some sort of demonic snake minded creature from Hell itself?*

*Nah*, I smiled, *I'll go for the casual approach. These guys are already scared witless.*

I knocked on the door. Their hearts almost knocked through their ribs.

One of them pleaded, with all the might of a kitten trying to emulate a lion:

"Leave us alone, we're sorry! Go back from whence you came!"

*Whence?*

My eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets.

"Whence? What do you think this is, some medieval LARP? Look, I have no idea where I am. I was just about to shower and get ready for work when you kids accidentally summoned me."

A trembling voice replied:

"But how do we know you're not a demon??"

I looked up to the ceiling. On it were pictures of orcs and elves. The walls of the room were plastered with busty ladies in skimpy armor.

"Well, opening the door would help. Didn't you even look at me before bolting? Or are you guys so wimpy that a little flash of light caused all that screaming?"

Silence. Silence that lasted a minute, but felt like a lifetime.

*I just want a taxi home*...

Slowly, the door creaked open. 

In front of me stood 3 teenage boys, all quite tubby and spotty. I would call them generic nerds, but considering my passion for the occult got me into this situation, who am I to judge?

"How did you get here?" asked the long haired, greasy one. "We thought all that Ouija board stuff was nonsense, we were just trying to have a fun Friday night."

I looked at them, with the disdain of a vegan looking at a medium rare rib-eye.

"It's a long story."
