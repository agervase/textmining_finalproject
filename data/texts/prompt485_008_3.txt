Hey have you ever heard of Deadpool? Well Im like the retarded version of that. Hi my name is Frank Greenhill and im half-mortal!

Basically it all started when my mom a super party girl back in the 80s met this guy who was smoking joints left and right and was covered in coke, and she knew that she had to talk to him, they talked and talked until they finally found some common intrests, mom was totally falling for him. Boom the sirens start ringing and its a raid, they were cracking down on drugs around that time, hard, and so the dude grabed my moms hand and ran out the back where... Da da dunnn... A cop caught them, that cop is my dad. He ended up taking my mom and putting her into his cruiser and taking the other dude to one of his mates. My dad who sant be named was driving my mom to the station but classic mom started singing which peaked dads intrest and they ended up hitting it off too, dad listened to her story and instead of arresting her the ended up in a motel which would result in me.

Its been some time, mom grew really old and died 5 years back and im officialy 52 a 52 year old stuck in a 16 year olds body, my mom had forgotten to mention to me that my dad was immortal and that when he ran off iy was because he was supposed to be sterile and I definitely wasnt supposed to be born. Well dad looks like ya fucked up! Whenever I try killing myself, because being 53 in a child body is something you cant imagine, I cant do it extremely just way to painful so I stick to poison, doesn't work, alchol, blood loss, poison nothing works cause of half immortal organs. Once I went to donate blood and the doctor contacted my mom saying that my blood was horrific, i apparently wont die but absorb anything bad, I have Diabetes, HIV, Cancer, Hep A, B, C, and a shit ton more but it just doesn't effect me.

First attempt and its really shitty, **dont read it** i just really dont wanna delete all my typing.
