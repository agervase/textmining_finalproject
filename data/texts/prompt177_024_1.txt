"I did it!" I screamed at the top of my lungs.  My roommate came lugging over.

"What, what did you do?"

"I finally made a wooden rake.  After years and years of careful research on the properties of wood, and the architecture of what makes a rake, I'm finally finished.  I can't wait to go test it out."
I noticed my roommate wasn't enthusiastic of my success as I was, but I didn't care, I was on top of the world.  I ran outside to try the rake out.

Unfortunately, I had used a very dry and flammable wood to be the bones of my creation, which is why destiny took a dark turn that day.
It turns out, due to my incredible speed, (I used to be a sprinter in high school), and the condition of the wood, it caught on fire.

"Blazes!" I screamed out literally and figuratively.  In one sense, for the rake that was currently burning away in front of my eyes.  The latter, for the state my heart was in at the moment.  

"Water!" I screamed out again.  I was just a one word pony at the moment.  If one is caught in my position, they would find it very hard to find water lying around, and such as it was I was in my position. 

 I looked around at the cars around me, and knew what I had to do.  I started hitting them with the rake to put the fire out.  I've seen people on tv use brooms to put out a car fire, so I figured this was basically the same thing.  Let's just say I wasn't in a very clear state of mind (to be fair, I had stayed up all night finishing that rake).  

Well, I've learned my lesson on what not to do with a wooden rake.  Guess it's time to try again.
