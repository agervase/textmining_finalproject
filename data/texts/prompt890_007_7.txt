Today I go to prison. Not much of a reason, just wanted to sightsee and enjoy a different kind of life... not. I mean, how do you get sent to prison over a speeding ticket!

&#x200B;

While at that, I also had to bear the thoughts of some... of the more mentally challenged people around me. Seriously, commuting time was the worst of all. From drugs, to thoughts about raping people, to guilty bastards, to those who thought of themselves as innocent... variety is all I could say to describe my torture.

&#x200B;

Then, one day another weird kid came to add to the variety. Honestly, I wouldn't mind, since I'm getting released soon, but this one just wouldn't shut up.

&#x200B;

'I know you can hear me.' He started out, letting his thoughts out loud, and even actively trying to be as loud as he could, though it mattered little.

He was going at it for so long, I would think he had me, had he not been looking all over people's faces all the freacking time.

&#x200B;

'Know what? I'm going to confess something... I'm gay.' He thought, much to my displeasure. Worse of all? This time he was looking straight at my eyes.

&#x200B;

It was so hard not to give a reaction, I turned my face away from him and did a fake cough. I had mastered my cover arts throughly over the years! I didn't have to face people like him just once, after all, though he holds the record for pissing me off the most by far. Not to mention things get weird when people find out.

&#x200B;

'I'm stopping once you admit it. Like, come on, don't be shy, it's getting ridiculous after a while.' He thought, this time staring at one of the other prisoners. It was a small mistake on his part I guess...

&#x200B;

"What the fuck are you staring at me about, huh?" The prisoner yelled and hit the bars. He was directly on the opposite side of us, and his act made his so intimidated, I almost wanted to kiss him for saving me from the little twerp... almost.

&#x200B;

The man wasn't as angry as he portrayed himself to be, just a bit annoyed, though I could see how he relaxed after seeing the face of the annoying kid. He stopped after that and sat back down, but the thoughts of that kid were forever priceless!

&#x200B;

'Okay, so that may not have been him... fuck.' The kid thought, this time genuinely, not trying to find anything about me or some psychic by it. It was so relaxing I may had let some of it show to my face.

&#x200B;

'Fuck, even this weird dude is laughing at me. That's right asshole, never express any emotions until your buddy here gets mocked at!' He thought while looking at me. I wonder when did he start thinking we were buddies or whatever... nonetheless, the kid seemed to calm down, and finally after days of torture I had my first peaceful sleep.

&#x200B;

I woke up the next day, finding it free from all the constant yelling of him trying to find a psychic, feeling a bit weird for not having to constantly try to block something. I look next to me, and I 'see' how he feels lonely.

&#x200B;

Geez, when did I start becoming so empathetic...

"Kid, you were screaming you ass off all the week, how come you stopped now?" I call out to him, waking him up from his stupor.

&#x200B;

He takes a few minutes to process what I actually said to him, before his face lights up in an epiphany, "Oh my god! It's you!" he said to me, opting out from thinking about the message. A good decision because I was tired from having to short out all those alien thoughts in the first place. Only once did I appreciate this ability and that was when I had exams to take with other people in school.

&#x200B;

His next words surprised me a bit, but I couldn't help but laugh at his response, "I'm really sorry for annoying you the past week. I-I just wanted to meet one of you for so long, I..." He said, his voice growing low near the end, "I wanted to tell my little sister I met one so much..."

&#x200B;

A pretty honest kid, vastly different from the opinion I had of him the past week. His image improved, but I still hadn't forgiven him for his preservance.

"So now what?" I asked the kid with curiosity. He must have had another goal if it was to try so hard for an entire week. I'm not an expert, but keeping the same thoughts for so long without even a hint of progress was something daunting.

&#x200B;

"Ermm... nothing really. I really want to thank you for revealing yourself after what I did the past week, but can't really do much aside from an apology and perhaps whatever you want, aside from my eternal gratitude." He said to me.

&#x200B;

Looking at him he was really thankful for what I did, not to mention he genuinely meant his words.

Honestly, seeing him so happy for the rest of the week, and how akward he was around me made me feel a lot better. He was akward in a different sense from the rest, and him trying to be thoughtful of me, while normally would be annoying, this time I found it silly.

&#x200B;

It was a change of pace when I saw him reverting to what I could say was his true personality after a while. He wasn't actively trying to be mindful of me, nor trying to act normal. He was **being** normal.

&#x200B;

After I was released, I felt so free my nost immediate thoughts were if I should be going to jail more often, but the sheer stupidity of the suggestion hit me only the next second and I couldn't help but laugh at it.

&#x200B;

It honestly was so relaxing being beside one guy whom knew your secret, yet wasn't acting to be normal, I already missed the kid.
