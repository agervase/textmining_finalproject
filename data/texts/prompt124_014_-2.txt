I challenged a god to a hunting competition. Stupid i know right but i was informed that i was going to die and i managed to bruise his ego enough to make him accept a friendly challenge. Short story short he somehow lost probably intentionally telling by whats going on back on earth right now. Because i did not want to die he granted me immortality. I am in sector 17 living on Pulster  as a celebrity "the man who can't die" now that is a bad ass title. But i'm getting off track Earth is being consumed by the sun right now and i'm living the high life. Drinking the best scotch and whiskey in the galaxy, smoking fancy cigars, talk show appearances. Hell i even have my own TV show and novel all because some dumb ass god thought immortality would be a bad thing. Sure i outlive those i love but i will find others. It's truely a small price to pay for this decadence. Not to mention the mega corps every one of them is up my ass to say i use their medical product or something like that to try and make those desperate for a cure to their fatal disease buy it. Even better i don't appear to age when i took up that bet the adverage lifespan was what 20 maybe 30 if lucky. I look like a 25 year old and i'm centuries old hell i lost count. I find ways to entertain myself i don't get bored because technology enhances and i stay up to date with it all. so yeah Immortality rocks and that god thought he could pull a fast on on me. Oh boy was he wrong besides what could possibly go wrong........No no no cut that last part out makes me sound to narcissistic. oh dammit look at the time i got a meeting in 15 minutes can we continue this another time? Ah great see you next Tuesday then and remember. Demi-gel the cure to all your ailments. god this biography is gonna be great (this is my first one so be honest but go a bit easy i'm always trying to improve as a writer)
