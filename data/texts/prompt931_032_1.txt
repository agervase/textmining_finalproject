Today we interview last year's Hitler Hunt winner, Eric Brdinie, who got his kill by  piloting a nanobot in a 'blitzkrieg' on Hitler's nervous system. Careful testing by judges revealed that Eric killed Hitler a fraction of a second before the bullet. Testing also revealed that the timeline created by Eric's kill is indistinguishable from Timeline Zero, an unprecedented feat and proof of concept. 

**First of all, good luck on Hitler Hunt 2036.**

Thanks.

**Maybe just as background for those who might not know it, how did you come up with your idea for last year's kill?**

Well first of all, I'm a graduate student at CMU and I work in a lab that focuses on nano telematics and piloting. Obviously Hitler Hunt is a big deal and while I was watching the kills three years ago, you know, I was just starting at my lab and I got this idea to use the systems I work on. 

**What was the most difficult thing about what you did?**

Definitely it was figuring out where to hide all of the equipment I needed to set up to pilot the bots. All in all I needed like 3 cubic meters of space for the batteries, the piloting harness, the launchpad, and radios. I needed a full cubic meter just for the batteries because you know, there's no way you can get power back then right there. 

The Fuhrerbunker is small and just jampacked with people. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out if I could set up there, talked to a lot of past Hitler Hunters about it. At the end of the day I just realized it was impossible so I started looking outside of the Fuhrerbunker and investigating how to increase the range for my transmitter. 

At the same time, the Reich Chancellery is far from deserted and basically everywhere I looked there was a chance of being discovered and branching the timeline. I eventually figured out a series of rooms I could rotate between in order not to get caught but the timing was super intricate and I really had to have my gear together and not leave anything incriminating behind. So that was the hardest thing - had to get the timing and the movements flawless. 

**Did you worry that the judges would not appreciate the subtlety of your kill?**

Yeah you know I get that a lot. Some people still aren't impressed by it. [laughs] I guess the gory deaths are the real crowd-pleasers. But you know I had to submit my plan-of-attack to the judging committee for approval and when I went in for the presentation it was pretty clear to me that they understood how unique and how tough my plan was. I mean, there were a lot of things that had to break just-right in order to get this to work. 

Like the other thing I spent a lot of time on was how to kill Adolf, and in demonstrable way, but still have him go through the motions of the suicide. So lots of studying ways to kill with a single nanobot but as instantaneously as possible and not disrupt his arm holding the gun. 

**Can you give us any hints about your plan this year?**

Well I'm afraid it's not going to be super-different from last year. It's a nanobot again. I'm piloting it again. I'm still going to be in the Chancellery. But I can give you the twist. Instead of a separate timeline indistinguishable from Timeline Zero, if I manage to pull this off, *it will still be Timeline Zero*.
