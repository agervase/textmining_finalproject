As I walked across the metal floor of the bank vault, the tap-tap-tap of my running shoes echoed from the dense walls.  The key was cold in my clammy hand, as I ran my fingers over it, feeling the digits - 671.  The vault guard stopped me at the huge circular door, and inserted a card in the control panel.

*A long lost relative maybe?*  The possibilities endlessly popped around in my 21 year-old skull. 

"In."  The guard impatiently gestured toward the now-open vault.

The key glimmered in the soft light as I held it in my fingers.  I pushed it gingerly into the lock of door 671, the metal mechanism rasping like an old man.  It opened, and there it was.  A room packed with tray after steel tray of shiny stacked coins, each bright and new.  On the floor, a cardboard box, and a musty parchment envelope with a wax seal.  It felt damp in my hands as I uncurled the paper:

*Mr. Simmons,*

*We have been in your debt for many years now, for the lives you have saved, and the lives you have taken.  When you began playing Galactic Attack 2 and used your signature phrase 'If I had a nickel for every person I killed!' when each cruiser was destroyed, each headshot registered, we took notice.  When we designed Galactic Attack 2, the multiplayer game cloud connected to our star system servers, our ships, and our units, to help us succeed in our endeavors.  You helped us to win the war against the Malforsians, and now we repay your debt - in nickels as you requested.  11 million, one for every enemy life taken, and one for every life saved.  Enclosed is another certificate, representing the winnings as proceeds from a Galactic Attack 2 tournament, all taxes prepaid.  The bank is authorized to convert the nickels into a private account at your request.*

*With all honor, Praetor Vink*

I fumbled to open the cardboard box, revealing a cheesy plastic GA2 tournament trophy, presumably for my shelf.  The guard raised his eyes to me.

"Take the check kid, these nickels weigh around a million pounds."
