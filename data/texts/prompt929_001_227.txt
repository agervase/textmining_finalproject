I shifted nervously in my seat. It had been around 17 years since The Founder had called a meeting.  

I looked around the enormous furnished ebony conference table. The Prime Minister, along with several high ranking officials surrounded the table. There were several members I didn't recognize, but I did not doubt the political power they possessed. You had to earn a place on The Founders table.  

Everyone felt the silent tension in the air, yet no one dared to speak. Suddenly what appeared to be a giant slab of marble lit up, revealing a face that was brutally beaten. The nose and the mouth was merged into a bloody mess, making it impossible to distinguish between the two. Several teeth, that appeared to be of some unearthly creature remained embedded into the forehead of the individual.   

We all stared, not knowing how to react. I felt my feet go cold, my mind dizzy, unable to comprehend what my eyes looked at. It was The Founder. His lifeless eyes stared at us and with grueling difficulty his lips moved. 

"The...The truce has been...broken." 

We heard a demonic quack and the stream turned off, and went back to looking like a marble block. My lips were parched, and my hands were shaking. I went to grab the glass of water in front of me and it spilled, all over the 150 year old table. I stared at the pool of water. What else could go wrong? I looked up, and everyone was looking at me.   

"Oh come on, I can't be the only one who's spilled water. "  

The Prime Minister looked at me, with a horrific gaze. 

"You...You didn't apologize."
