"Hello. Jon here. How can I help you?", a stereotypical Indian voice pretending to fake an American accent replied back. After all these years, couldn't the actually named Jogender, but fake named Tech Support Jon had not shed the weird accent. Even though he was probably not Indian. It had almost become an hallmark of the profession, like so many others.

"I am having trouble filling the signup form for internet access.", and since I had only one ISP, I was at their mercy. I wasn't going to tell them that, though they probably already knew.

"Sure sir. I can help you with that. Please input your information on the phone app and we'll proceed."

"Umm. About that. I can't enter my name in the app."

"That's strange sir. Can you reboot your phone and then call me back?"

Fuck me. "I have already called twice before and rebooted my phone."

"I don't have your name in my system sir. Just reboot it once more and then we can go further."

"Can I talk to your manager?"

"Well... If that is what you want. I hope you have a pleasant day."

And then another goddamn Jogender hung up. Again. That bloody. Every bloody call centre employ was going to be a Jogender. How the fuck was I supposed to sign up for internet?

Bloody stupid web designer Cathryn's and bloody stupid call centre Jogender. And my stupid hippy mom. You'll have a unique name. Girls will really like it.   

I looked at the name change application in my hands. Thank god it was a paper and pen copy, but I had to ask someone. Was it so hard to make the name field a text box, instead of a drop down? Stupid Bobby Drop Tables, making it harder on all of us. I grumbled and started filling the name change application.
