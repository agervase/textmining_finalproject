I knew I was destined for something grand, but at the same time I didn't quite see it myself going this way. Everyone knew what they wanted to be growing up, but I only wanted to know a little bit about a lot. I wanted to knowledgeable about everything, just like my Dad. He was very intelligent and always helpful. It was no wonder that he was the head of the Human Resources department at his work place. He was always traveling every other week to find people to best help his workplace be its best.

&nbsp;

It wasn't until the day, the Reaper came. I wasn't sure what it could have been but I thought I was dead. For sure I knew I was going to die. Then the Reaper finally said "Like me. Your soul is out there. Take this scythe and find it."

&nbsp;

I was confused at first, but as I took the scythe, the Reaper lifted back his hood and it all made sense. I WAS the black sheep in the family out of the three children. My two younger brothers obtained college degrees, were well accomplished in there respective fields, and then there was just me, college drop out, working 40 hours a week to support my own family of five.

&nbsp;

"Son," my father started, "it's time for you to find you. This blade has been in the family for generations. We are what people call Reapers, but we're actually more of a soul collector. With this scythe, you can look into the souls of others, harvest part of it for your self, or destroy it completely."

&nbsp;

"What do you mean?" I asked. "I can collect souls? Don't I just go around killing people?"

&nbsp;

"Mitch, the time has come for you to finally accept your fate. We, being the eldest born, have no soul. We must make it our life's mission to find our soul before we die, or Heaven will never open its gates for us. It's all because of our family's greatest sin. And since the dawn of time, the scythe was ours to find our soul, lost out in the world."

&nbsp;

"What sin?" I replied. "The original sin? Like with Adam and Eve in the Bible?"

&nbsp;

"Don't be foolish. Our sin was before man-kind."

&nbsp;

That was all he needed to say. I sighed loudly, unsure of what to do next. It was a lot to take in and I was sure that he was yanking my chain. My Dad was the best Dad in the world. He was always busy working and traveling and now I knew why.

&nbsp;

"Dad, what did you mean by harvesting souls for me?"

&nbsp;

"The scythe, like I said, can rip the souls out to kill another person. Or you can use it to harvest part of the soul for you. The knowledge and wisdom contained within become yours. Every person you see, won't be able to see the scythe, and with practice you can make it look more natural in your movements. When you harvest part of a soul, the person, forgets bits and pieces of knowledge they have attained, however, they won't know what it was until they try to recall. It will just come back eventually, so no harm is done."

&nbsp;

"Dad, did you ever find your soul?"

&nbsp;

"Yeah, took me a while, but once you find yours, you'll be more...complete."

&nbsp;

I had stood there in awe, shock, and confusion all at once staring at the scythe. I had thought maybe I was a knight in a past life, but the scythe was not a sword. It felt light, but at the same time, it was not. My soul, it's out there somewhere. And I've still yet to find it...
