Dear diary, 12th October 2932.

They awoke the wicked. he who kills like he breathes.... if he did.

back in the 2500's, cybernetic wars led to the creation of the knights, and the legend says he's one of them.

Legend also says he wiped an entire battleship with a single pen, and his left thumb.

Word says he has no emotions, nor a face.

...And that man is my neighbour. he lives upstairs. lovely old dude, he pays me to clean his flat.

*Well, if you consider dumping human limbs in an acid drum* ***cleaning***\*,\* that is.

It all changed when the thugs attacked, yesterday night.

First they came in quiet and one of them held me at gunpoint, then they went upstairs.

...

&#x200B;

Now, there's a hole between his kitchen and my bathroom. a grenade first opened the way, then his fist went through my ceiling. with a head attached to it. he apologized profusely and handed me over 50G's "to help him out and for the damage"

&#x200B;

Jeez. i believe they went in with like 20 people. it was over in 15 seconds flat.

&#x200B;

\*BLAOOOOM\* (that's the door, his door)

BRRRRT TATATATATATA!!! PAW!! POW! (the thugs start hosing out)

Whiiiirrrr...THUD! BAOM! SBAF! THUNK!! KER-POW! THUNK! CRUNCH!! SPRASH! (he woops their asses with their arms (that's what i could hear))

BLAAAAAAOOOOOM! (grenade goes off)

SCRUNCH! (he finishes the fight with the hand in the face thing)

One of them escaped with his hovercar, an antique, original, stallion sprint. guess my van wasnt good enough.

he had a jack russel, poor thing took a chunk of the door in the face when they blew it in.

he asked me to help him bury it first of all. with the house sprayed in blood and gore.

Anyhow.

I've learnt a ton of shit in like 16 hours.

How crooked the city is.... how fast money can erase things.. and how quick a cyborg can go downstairs and shove his fist though an armed man who was about to kill me.

You know, I've been unable to identify if the chunks were male or female, it was that bad.

Also I've learnt that cyber-knights are a thing. it's written on them.  like "KNIGHT SERIES 0015 - property of the US ARMY"

i gotta find what is this mysterious corporation though. US ARMY? Isn't the term army patented by Gazorpazorp Inc?

He just left the condo, by the look of his gear, he's gonna nuke something till it dies to death.
