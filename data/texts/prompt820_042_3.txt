The secret room underneath was miraculous. There were blades aplenty, proudly displayed. Some were obvious; Excalibur, Caliburn, Saint Peter's Sword, Arondight. These were weapons of the greatest heroes of history.

In the back of the room, something called to me. I approached the back and saw something small covered in dust. This thing wasn't like the others. It was not copper, nor bronze, nor iron or steel. It was a piece of leather tied to rope made of more leather. Sitting beside it were five small stones. I wiped away the dust on the small nameplate beneath the pedestal.

‎**דוד**

I was rusty on my Hebrew, but I'm pretty sure that meant "Beloved." Then I realized something and tried wiping it more.

‎**דָּוִד**

*David*

It kept calling to me. Suddenly I lost all control of my body. My hand shot for the weapon and immediately I had a weird vision. It was like I was actually there. In front of me towered a man about 9 feet tall. He was covered in armor and had a javelin. Although I never saw this man before, I could hear his name screaming in my mind.

*Goliath*

My arm started spinning the weapon and released one side of the rope, launching one of the stones square in the giant's forehead. Goliath toppled dead to the ground.

When I came to, I was shaking and sweating. Outside I could here sirens and people yelling. I grabbed the sling and stones and ran outside. Right at the gates of the lawn was a tall man about two stories tall. I recognized him instantly.

"DAVID! WHERE ARE YOU? YOU AND I HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS!"

I start to walk forward, but I feel a tug at my shoulder.

"Mr. President what are you thinking!? You're going to get killed!"

"Samuel, my good friend, I appreciate your concern, but I know what needs to be done."

I continued forward down the front lawn of The White House towards Goliath.

‎"היום הזה יהוה יספוק לך לתוך היד שלי, ואני אכה אותך: אני אתן את הגופות של המארח הפלשתי היום הזה כדי ציפור של האוויר אל הערוב של כדור הארץ; כי כל הארץ ודאי יודע כי יש אלוהים בישראל, וכי כל הקהל הזה ודאי יודע כי אלוהים מציל לא בחרב ובחנית; לקרב הוא אלוהים, והוא ייתן לך לתוך היד שלנו ".


*This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.*
