He rose from the depths as the mothership continued bombarding.......something...

Cthulhu wasn't quite certain, he recalled that he hadn't specifically been paying attention when he rose up from the ocean, he wasn't really thinking about the wheres or the whys, he just knew that that asshole tim had summoned him again....just by being near an ocean.
How many times was it that general tim gallajer escaped his wrath? how many times had this one jerk come close to having his mind utterly minced by the terrifying presence of the greatest force of evil in all of creation, only to narrowly escape?! 
at this point cthulhu was at seventy times and counting, seventy times this jerk had miraculously escaped unscathed and not giving a flying fuck. he was supposed to be the terror of the unknown, an ultimate being that could strike fear into the hearts of men!!! WHY WAS THIS HAPPENING?!?! his very existence, that of an ant, mocked cthulhu and-

A laser struck him square in the face.

"OKAY, WHO HAS THE BALLS?!" the great evil god-being shouted. "WHO DARES SUMMON THE MIGHTY CTHULHU AND- his next words came out as "FHTAGN!!!" as a missile struck him square in the face.
reeling, and genuinely pissed, he roared "TIM!!! WHEN I FIND YOU I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU WISH I HAD TORN YOU FOUR NEW ASSHOLES LIKE I PROMISED DURING THAT DECEMBER TRIP TO JAPAN YOU MADE!!! DO YOU HEAR ME- who the hell are you?" 

it was a saucer....flying...those things flew?
he scratched his head, and another laser smacked him in the face.
Unamused, and angry, he decided that since he couldn't seem to find tim, the ONE human in this accursed cesspool of a world he wanted to kill the most and the ONE human he wasn't able to get...for...some...reason, he'd take his anger out on the giant floating saucer thingy.

It occurred to him then, that a similar race of ants had once been wiped out by his kind for having the gall to equip themselves with weapons that irritated him, and he recalled, that they had been wiped out during what equated to a genocidal sneeze.

"oh...right...those jerks.." he muttered. "guess they survived after a-"
another blast from its laser interrupted him, and he roared "DAAAAAMMN YOUUUU TIIIIM!!! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO THIS TIME?!?! AM I, THE MIGHTY CTHULHU, REDUCED TO BEING YOUR ERRAND BOY?!? I'LL KILL THESE STUPID FOOLS, AND THEN I'M COMING FOR YOU!!! DO YOU HEAR ME TIM!! THE LOWEST HELL IMAGINABLE PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE AGONY YOU'LL FEEL AND-" the spaceship fired another laser and cut him off. 
"STOP IT!!! STOP FIRING THAT STUPID LASER!!" the air turned red as he fired a radiating wall of pure malice and hatred, and the spaceship melted.

more came down from the skies and cthulhu stared in disbelief. "I was so sure i killed all of these..." he grumbled.

"TIM WHAT DID YOU DO?!?" he roared. "TIM!!! TIIIIM!!! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU WHEN I'M DONE RE-GENOCIDING THESE ALIENS!!!!! DO YOU HEAR ME TIM!!! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME OVER SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES!!! I'LL FIND YOU AND-"

they all began firing lasers and cthulhu sighed angrily.
it was going to be a long, long day, he decided.
