Like most people, I was tested for my luck when I was young. Prior to that point, nothing good ever happened to me. I tripped all the time, when somebody in class was left behind on a field trip, it was me, and to be honest with you whenever something bad happened, it happened to me first and worst.

So it didn't surprise me at all when I scored 100 on my luck test. That was the unluckiest thing that ever happened. Like all people with that kind of luck, we're supposed to be imprisoned because of the danger we posed to everyone else. The only problem is that I'm only here because I'm so unlucky I scored a 100 on that test.

But the really weird thing is that everyone else here is exactly like me. They're all tripping all the time, getting themselves injured, nearly dying. One of them contracted the bubonic plague! That was wiped out a century ago, and there was nothing we could do for him. It was an antibiotic resistant strain. He didn't die, of course. He lives on and constant misery.

Now you might think that somebody would notice how unlucky we are and let us out. That would be wrong. The unfortunate thing is that every time a guard comes around the guy with Bubonic plague feels a little bit better. Every time something unlucky happens to me, by freak accident the cameras cut out. It's almost staggering that the guards are always looking exactly the wrong way at exactly the right time to make my life miserable.

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be one of the lucky ones who didn't score 100 on this test. They're probably wandering around out there somewhere, living life to the fullest. I bet they scored a perfect 50 on the exam, dead average.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to pry my head out of this bear trap. It fell out of a plane that have been misdirected here during a storm. It's on pretty snug, so I feel pretty lucky about that, because, you know, it could be worse.

Couldn't it?
