I meet death again for another match of heads or tails. I look around the room nervously as he pulls out the coin of life or death from a drawer. Unknown to me, death had a trick up his sleeve. Instead of pulling out his normal quarter, he grabbed a double sided coin. He knows that I always pick tails. And it never fails.  He hides it from me and tosses it into the air. I close my eyes and smile as I call heads. And I open it to see it landed on heads. "Awesome death, take me to the age of 21. I want to party"
"Your wish shall be granted" death glared
All of a sudden, I was transformed into my younger body of 21, in my car driving to a bar. I meet my friends there and we get our drink on. I kept taking shots like nobody's business. Every girl that walked in, got a few well placed pick up lines from the smooth drunken lips of myself. It got to the point of the night where it would be wise of us to turn in. As we were leaving I noticed a beautiful woman sitting by herself at the bar. I pushed through my friends and stumbled toward her. "Hey, those are some nice shoes. Wanna bang?" I said with confidence. She smiled at me and slapped my face. I decided I should probably leave. So I got in my car and spent five minutes trying to shove my key in the ignition. A common problem for me, both in the car and in the bedroom. Soon I was back to driving and I hit a tree. Dying instantly. I saw a bright light and I was back in the same room. But this time, death had a surprise for me. He looked me dead in the eye and told me.... "This post is meaningless. I just felt like writing a bunch to get everybody's hopes up"
