I close my eyes again, the whole 'sensory overload' thing is getting the better of me.  It's simpler this way, I can relax and focus on Doc's questions. His excitement, mixed with a bit of concern, is creeping through his normally nonchalant personality. "It may take some time for you to properly interpret the images you're experiencing", he said reassuringly. "I'm sure that you're feeling overwhelmed, but to improve assimilation chance, you'll need your eyes open and your mind actively attempting to narrow the point of convergence". "Do what?", I questioned. "You need to open your eyes and focus, Thomas", he replied firmly. "Also, I apologize for the temperature in the room, there may be something wrong with the ventilation system. Even I am sweating a little.", Doc admitted.

"No worries doc, I feel pretty good actually". Hesitantly, I open my eyes and strain against the input. I've been assured that the light levels will be at a minimum but I'm wishing that there were a few lower settings in the system. Something blurry in front of me, I make an attempt at bringing it into focus. Slowly the object fills in, it's lines and seams connecting, becoming vivid, becoming fuller and fuller, more exuberant by the second and I realize... it's moving.

"Doc, is that.. you?" I said, a little confused. Doc coughed, "Yes Thomas, I'm the only one here. Pleased to make your acquaintance in the land of the seeing!", he beamed. I touched his chest, "I just didn't think it would be like this. Why are you moving like that?". Tense, Doc replied, "Thomas, I'm not moving. I'm standing quite still as not to startle you".  I focused, "Right here where my hand is, there's movement, I see it Doc".

Doc grabs his right arm, "Like I said, you may be having trouble understanding what you're seeing. Don't worry, you'll get better at it with time".  A text tone plays, it's the door entry tone from that old sci-fi flick, the one with the earl grey guy. Doc reaches in his pocket for his phone as I turn to my right, "Who all is coming? I don't think i'm ready for visitors Doc".

&#x200B;

"No one is coming Thomas, after some initial tests i'll..", he trails off. Still holding his arm, Doc continues, "I'm sorry Thomas, i'm not feeling well I may need to.." He falls to his knees as another text alert rings from his phone. "Are you OK doc? What.. what's going on?" I ask worriedly. He checks his phone and turns to me sharply,  "Thomas i'm so sorry, you have to leave, they're coming for you.".

&#x200B;

I turn to my right again, there are figures hurriedly making their way towards us. I can tell they aren't in the room but I see them non-the-less. Doc has staggered his way towards the computer terminal when a door to my left shoots open. He struggles to speak, "Go Thomas! If they find you..". Doc kneels to the ground before falling to a prostrate position. I focus on him and I can no longer see any movement.

A thousands questions running through my mind and no one to answer them. My hands shaking I grab the table i'm sitting on and stand up. Noticing the approaching figures once more, I turn and face the open door.
