Blaring, the lullaby from Donkey Kong 64 pierces my sleep. My left creeps out from the blanket and swipes the screen. Why do I always have to shit, the moment I wake up? Makes for a hard time knocking back out.
Throw blankets, scratch Gooch, pained roll, floor. Between the, unnecessarily low, bed and the wall, I end up on my feet. Phone, cigarette. There's gotta be a lighter in the bathroom already.

One in front of the other, bathroom seems closer than yesterday. Ass planted, light cigarette, relief. Phone. Fucking wifi. Time Warner spectrum horseshit. 4g. No, no 4g. Amazing, how inconvenient a shit seems without a distraction.

Living room. Morning rituals, always. The only true question in mind is rail or smoke. Rail, first. What am I thinking.
Glass-Pill-Plate- phone rings. It's mom. I always feel guilty talking to her when on hard shit. She never approved. -card-cut-straw- but whatever, we all live how we live. -insufflate-cigarette.

Phone rings. "Dan." Yeah, Dan probably wants to kill some braincells. Swipe green.

"Good morrow, my friend"

"Dude! What the fuck is going on!?"

"Chill out, man, fuck. I'm just chillin on the couch."

"No, fuck that! Do you know what's going on? Tom just threw cable on, and it's all emergency broadcasts."

"No shit, what's it about?"

"Nobody knows, man. The Internet is down and we're all advised to stay in the house."

"Fuck. Alright, man. Shit, let me call my ma."

Tap red. Fuckin aye. The one time cord cutting shits on me. Contacts, scroll, scroll, scroll; "mama." Tap, tap green.

..............

Nothing.

Well, then.

Uprooting from the couch, gazing into the bedroom. Fuck. Clothes. On. No clean shirts, fuck it, chest naked under a jacket.

-chop-cut-straw-bam

Keys, wallet, keys, phone,... keys? Who the fuck keeps moving my keys. Lightbulbs; mushrooms, keys, last night....

Bingo, left em in the ignition.

Door, shoes, out. It always seems out of place, the snow, no matter how serene the blanket.

Garage, button. Button. Button. BUTTON. God damn this fucking button! Overhead opens.

Jeep door grinds open, too lazy to do anything about it. Ignition. Click. Of course. Hood release, stumble out, latch, open, lift positive, stumble in. Crank, force fuel, throw into gear. Too lazy to do anything about it. Stumble out, slam hood, stumble in.

Well, no data, not much for music. Turds snowballing, regardless if they're molehills.

Radio. Fuck the radio. Better than silence, I guess.

95.1 closest thing to decent. White noise. 96.5? White noise. 100.7 white noise. Somethings fucked, not the jeep in this case. AM band. Wrjn. 

"Igh ground. Evacuate your homes, immediately. It is recommended to bring nothing more than essentials. This message will repeat. *emergency tone*"

"*emergency tone* This is an emergency alert, this is not a test. We are advising all civilians to Evacuate their homes. Make way to high ground. Evacuate your homes, immediately. It is recommended to bring nothing more than basic essentials. This message will repeat. *emergency tone*"

Traffic is fucking insane, I thought no one knew how to drive, before. Thank God this fucker has 4 wheel. Bang a quick left out of the driveway, corner left, sharp left. Bike path. Fuck it.

6 blocks of no interruptions and a purpling sky, to make a right, circumventing the neighbors fighting over what looked like a slow cooker.

Driveway, parents cars are present. Kill jeep, keys, door, slam, run. Back door, fumbling keys, a slight dip down to unlock, open.

Black.
