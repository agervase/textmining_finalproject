Floating. Nothingness. Peace. Suddenly Peter felt air rushing into his expanding chest, his eyelids finally able to open after what seemed like an eternity. His vision begins to sharpen as a paper note appears on the bedside, his wive's handwriting welcoming him.

> Welcome back! 

> I made your favorite brownies, in the kitchen in the blue tupperware. 

> I love you baby. -Emma

> ps please be careful moving me, I got a nasty bruise from the freezer lid

"Oh shit." The lid must have caught her skin yesterday when he was putting her away, their new daily ritual. He rolled over and looked lovingly at Emma's lifeless body, now covered in ritualistic Gaelic markings. He gives her a tight hug, soaking up her fading warmth. He sighs. "I love you too baby"

He begins their morning routine, carrying her body into the bathtub so he can wash off their markings and essential oils from the ritual. After drying her off, he carries her to the large deep freeze they purchased, dropping her carefully on the pillows and making sure her body was clear of the lid before sealing her in. They figured out they had to stop the decomposition after their first few days were littered with the most disgusting farts of death imaginable. 

Walking over to the kitchen, he found the brownies which were delicious. Looking lovely at the white freezer with a sense of pride, he wrote his own note that read:

> Baby, you sure know how to bake. How did I get so lucky!

> Thinking of Benjamin Button for next date night, good with you?

> Picking up fresh supplies from The Cauldron tonight, they should be in the fridge

> Love you so much, Peter

He placed the note next to the bed before getting dressed for work. He had a lot to get done before tonight's ritual. It was a lot of work, but he knew Emma was worth it and that he couldn't live without her. Neither of them could.
