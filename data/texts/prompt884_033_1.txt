**PART 1**

​

Finally, the time has come. Last thing I remember... I was sitting at my desk in the office dealing with another call. And now I' m sitting here in a rather sparsely furnished room - Waiting. Same old same old. Well, it's another room, and it's even more sparsely furnished than my office - which is no furniture at all. Besides, I wouldn't call it sitting per se - my hands and my feet are tied up and my mouth gagged. And, whoever is responsible, must have found it funny to tie my ponytail to my feet with a rope. So I guess I'm lying here in this rather sparsely furnished room. And waiting. The floor is dirty, my cheek is dirty and I think I smell piss somewhere?

I could try to get out of this situation but I think I may miss the best part of the fun. Besides, he did a really good job. I can't move much without tearing my hair, my body tension is very high and requires almost all my strength and I can't lie down on my side because some rope from the ceiling seems to prevent it.

Let's play, Mr. Bondage, it's not like I'm not into it.

​

"Ah, you're going crazy, aren't you?"

​

A man then.

​

*"Yes, it is maddening - I can hardly wait!"*, I replied boldly.

​

I didn't realize he was in the room. I'd love to see his face. I wonder if he's scared. Or enjoyment? Where do the corners of his mouth stretch when I speak to him? What kind of kidnapper is he? If he is one. Will he carve me up, torture or rape me? Maybe just beat me up and sell me? How did he get into my office? I was alone, night shift, and I was just putting the phone back.

​

"Ha, that's how I like it. Your pride will make it all the easier for me. Then I shall release you from your impatience, and..."

​

I hear his feet in the room, like a clock following the beat of his steps; all this time he was in the back left corner. He goes to a spot and takes something from a table - or a chair? I'm not sure. His voice is pleasant, he speaks slowly, cautiously and carefully - his language is certainly not. He knows what he's doing. It may be someone who often speaks to people, a politician, or an entrepreneur, a man in a high position - or at least someone who talks to people a lot and either conducts them, advises them, persuades them - no, he presents and pitchs ideas. That might be it. Like an experienced musician whose instrument is voice and pronunciation.

"And I'll serve you the appetizer."

​

I hear the smile, the mischievous grin and the light joy in his voice - it doesn't seem particularly young but also not particularly old.

He seems to gain energy through resistance as well as being someone who enjoys playing and skirmishing. Probably a Sadistic disposition, suppressed aggression; however, no sexual offence - at least not if it is superficially about sexual acts. I think he should be able to live this out outside of this situation - he has tied the knots and ropes well, they do not hurt too much but are firm and prevent me from moving. Very skilled. I feel like a braised piglet on the presentation plate, impatiently waiting for the tapping. But where does his sadism come from?

​

*"Oh, I don't think I feel like the appetizer, I'm not here to play,"* I countered annoyed and mocking.

​

One cut, one kick. He cut the rope which hung from the ceiling and tied me in my position, and immediately afterwards he kicked me in the ribs. I think I tore out a few tufts of hair as the force of the attack made me groan and squirm.

​

"Oh, you're just here for whatever I want to do, you have nothing to say here. Your words are poison!"

​

Aggressive, irritated, loss of control. Not a very big shot, most likely power-horny. I guess in his professional life, he is being played, bludgeoned and crushed.

The desire for control. Probably the reason for his interest in bondage - which he probably plays out privately - but it is very difficult to satisfy sexual urges if you always kill your partners. So he will probably satisfy these desires in complete consensus. Therefore, this will probably not be a sexual assault, but a purely brutal and sadistic pacification of other desires.

​

*"It's pretty exhausting being on the bottom of the ladder and being constantly shit on by those on top, isn't it? You hate your boss, don't you?"* I am quite cold and merciless in my analysis.

​

I'm looking at him. He has a gun in his hand, he grasps it trembling, his hand is already white. He has a pretty and almost young face. Around 30, his eyes are cold and a spark of hope and life seems to have just gone out. He glances at me as if he remembers.
