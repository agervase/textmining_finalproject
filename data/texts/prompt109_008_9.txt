Owie, ouch ouch. Everything hurts. Did something happen while I was playing baseball again?

I squinted as I tried moving my head to look around the room. “M-mommy? Dah-dahddy?” I could barely speak properly — I was talking through a few cracked teeth. The tooth fairy must have come took ’em all already.

A fat lady walked into the room. She looked like a doctor because she had those gloves on and that blue dress thing.

“Goodness gracious,” she said. “You’re awake!”

I moved to get up from the bed, but my body wouldn’t listen. It hurt way more than that one time I broke my leg. Plus, it was all wrinkly and old. How come I don’t look the same anymore?

“Stop that, Chris. It’s time to take your medicine.”

“No!” I yelled.

She sighed as she walked up to me. I don’t know what’s going on, and this lady is already trying to make me do things I don’t wanna do. I put my lips inside my mouth so she couldn’t see my lips, and closed them tight.

“For fuck’s sake, Chris. Don’t be difficult.” She grabbed me by both arms and started to shake me. Piercing pains shocked my whole body.

“OW! Stop! It hurts!”

Suddenly, she grabbed me by the cheeks to push my lips out. I refused. Then came a firm punch right on my jaw, and there was this yucky taste in my mouth as she shook my head some more. I started to cry.

“I told you, Sweetie. Next time, just do as I say and it won’t hurt,” she said as she started walking towards the door.

“W-wait,” I said. “Where you goin’? Tell me what’s goin’ on!”

She shrugged and left the room. I couldn't get up no matter how hard I tried and it hurt too bad to continue, so I started to sob even harder.

 “Where is everybody?”
