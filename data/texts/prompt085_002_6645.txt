“We’re out of flatbreads.”

“Fuck,” I mutter. “What do you have?”

“Italian.”

“Just Italian?”

“Yeah.”

I check my watch. There’s only fifteen minutes left on my break. “Whatever. Italian it is.”

*Five billion.* The voice states it plainly. It comes sometimes, just random numbers. *One. Eleven.* I don’t pay too much attention to it, but recently it's been speaking almost every time I do something.

“Sorry about this,” the teenager says. “But it’s Subway. What can you expect?”

“Eat fresh, right?”

I walk out. Mark is there, sitting on the sidewalk with his sign. He looks a bit cleaner than normal today.

“Sorry, Mark. I don’t have any change today.”

“That’s okay. Enjoy your sandwich anyways!”

“I’ll try to.”“You don’t sound too happy about it.”

“Yeah. All they had had was Italian. The worst."

“The worst! When I was a kid and my mom would give me money for lunch, I would run to the pizza parlor and get a pizza sub on Italian.”

“A pizza sub? That sounds good.”

“It is,” he says wistfully, looking at my sandwich. I look down at it. It does look long, at the least, and I can only imagine what a day is like for Mark, watching people walk out with their sandwiches, waiting so he can cobble together just enough change to get his own.

“Here,” I say. “I’ll eat a big dinner.”

“Oh, no, I can’t do that, kid. You need to eat.”

“So do you. Really.” I drop it in his lap.

He looks at me and smiles. “Thanks, kid. You don’t know how much it means to me.”

I nod, and walk away. Soon, the incident fades from my memory, just another lost coin in the fountain of my mind.

“Now we have Earth,” the Chairman says. “Earth is an interesting case. They are headed for extinction in twelve cycles, so we could wait to attack, but by then it may be depleted.”

“Their depletion rate is that rapid?”

“The prevailing species there seems to be amongst the most careless of all we have observed. Agent 614, what did you observe there on your mission?”

Agent 614 nods. “The depletion rate is as we projected. The species is careless and wasteful, and quite dim as well. But…”“What? Spit it out, 614.”

“They seem to rank high on the compassion scale. I know that doesn’t matter much, but…” Agent 614 pauses, reminiscing on the sandwich. “I would recommend we don’t attack.”

The Chairman looks at 614, wondering what has gotten into his most ruthless agent. “Okay, then. Earth will be spared for now…”
