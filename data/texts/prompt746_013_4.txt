- *"So, are you the New One?"*

The kid kept asking him that. Quite honestly, John regretted taking on this job. He had been paid a whole lot of money for kidnapping this little child. Strangely enough, he had kept quiet throughout the whole ordeal. Young little Howard didn't scream when John broke his window. He didn't look scared when he was picked up and whisked from his bed and into the car. He even put on his own seatbelt. This kid never showed any sign of emotions. As strange as it may have sounded, he gave John a chill.

- *"So, are you the New One?"*

John didn't know what the inquery meant, but he didn't answer. He would kill this child. He told himself that he had to. That's what he had been paid for and he, no, his wife needed the money in order to survive. That was how he had justified all of his deeds, however horrible they may have been. And it was his justification now. He would end this young life, so answering the question wasn't important.

- *"So, are you the New One?"*

John started to get angry. He slapped the kid, but the little one didn't even flinch.

- *"So, are you the New One?"*

*"What do you mean?"* He had given in. John knew better, but if violence didn't shut the child up, maybe an answer would. It was a long drive to the location where he was supposed to off him.

- *"So you aren't the New One?"*

*"I can't answer that until you explain what you mean."* John barely realized that the question had changed.

- *"I guess we'll find out if you're the New One."*

Now that was clearly different. And it frightened John. He stopped the car and stepped outside. The meat cleaver was in the back. It wouldn't matter if the child was alive or dead when he reached the dead drop. He heard Howard saying something. *"What did you say?"*

- *"We'll find out now if you're the New One!"*

John opened the trunk and picked up the ~~metallic~~ ~~wooden~~ bone cleaver. Strange. Had it always been made out of ~~bone~~ ~~iron~~ stone? It wasn't important. It was his cleaver, John knew that much. He closed the trunk, circled the car and reached the ~~front door~~ trunk. After five more steps he opened the ~~door~~ gate and stared at the ~~child~~.

- *"You are not the New One."*

John swung his weapon and drew blood. Strange. The ~~cleaver~~ ~~machete~~ dagger was clearly bloody, yet the ~~child~~ in front of him was unharmed. Come to think of it, he felt kind of strange. A damp warmth spread down from his own neck.

- *"I will go back to the Old One now."*

As John's world turned dark, the ~~child~~ began to smile.
