STEP RIGHT ON UP TO THE STAND PLAYER TWO!!!

The crowd went wild cheering for him. He hadn't realized he just stumbled onto a gameshow just in time to be a contestant.

Announcer: PLAYER TWO WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE US TO YOU? What is a day like for you?

Player 2: I, uh-

Announcer: HA HA, Great story, classic player two, now that we know the contestants why don't we move on to the first round. 

*DING DING*

Announcer: Ok round one as you all know is the battle of wits. You will both be put to the test through a round of trivia questions, get even one question wrong and... well DON'T GET A QUESTION WRONG!! AH HAH HAH HAH!! LETS GO!!!!

The platform lowered over down to the ground level pool of water. 

Announcer: Ok player one, first question. "Who played harrison ford in the first star wars movie?"

Player 1: Indiana jones

Announcer: CORRECT!!! PLAYER TWO ARE YOU READY?!

Player 2: I'm uuuuhh.... yea-

Announcer: OK HERE WE GO, this ones a little trickier. " WHO WAS THE ORIGINAL HOST OF "THE PRICE IS RIGHT, and what was his famous public service announcement every round, and how many animals are put down annually, as well as who played chewbacca in the 1st star wars and why did he take a sabbatical while filming 'empire strikes back' amd what was his catchphrase for the first movie?"

Player 2: huhwhat? Player one's question was way the fuck easier and this isn't a single question, this game is rigged and i don't even know how i got here?

Announcer glares at him angrily and changes tone of voice to that of an angry psychopath (for reading purposes think "patrick bateman's character in 'batman begins')

Announcer: player 2 you broke into my studio and put yourself in this position, you have no room to complain, now the next GODDAMN THING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH BETTER BE THE FUCKING ANSWER!!! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME????!!!?"

Player 2 quickly realized he was out of his element and this was going to end badly. On national television? What the hell kind of show is this? Quickly he stuttered out the following

Player 2: Bob barker, uh, don't forget to donate to charity and uuuhh

Announcer: OOOH, OUCH PLAYER 2 THAT IS INCORRECT, folks what was bob barkers famous psa?

Audience: SPAY OR NEUTER YOUR PETS!!!SPAY OR NEUTER YOUR PETS!!!SPAY OR NEUTER YOUR PETS!!!SPAY OR NEUTER YOUR PETS!!!

They chanted growing in intensity and the whole tone of this show revealed itself to player two. Slowly he was lowered down into the pool. Immediately he realized this wasn't water. It was some sort of acid, it ate right through his shoes and started burning his skin slowly.

Player 2: HEELLLP!!! PLEASE I- OH GOD, PLEASE I'M GOMNA DIE!!!!

As the podium lowered it eventually stopped right at waist level, player 2 couldn't move and had to hold himself above the burning liquid. He had been effectively castrated. 

Announcer: Ok folk, don't touch that dial, we're just getting started, we're gonna take a quick break and return after a short word from our sponsor. 

And I'm all out of idea's for this writing prompt. Idk, i just thought "game show contestant" and the rest i just bullshit as i went along. 

First writing prompt ever, now i can crosd this sub off my bucket list.
