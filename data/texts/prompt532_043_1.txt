He was already starting to shows the signs. New hairs growing out of his ears, the relocating of the hair on his head to around his nipples and brown spots. He was ok with being where he was in life and didn't want to budge. And that just wouldn't do. 

Milly looked down at her plate and took another bite of egg. She looked up and saw her mother had been staring at her overdue father. 

"Delicious eggs mom." 

Her mother averted her gaze back to Milly. Took a long draw from her cigarette and blew. 
"Glad you like them. Soon you'll have to learn to become a woman just like me." 

"Maybe you can teach me how to cook?"

Milly's grandfather began coughing and pounded his chest. Her mother looked on as she took another draw from her piece. 

"When you're of age. Like 12 or 13." 

Milly's grandfather put his fork down. His cough wasn't letting up. 

"You know what? The chickens that lay these eggs? They are harvested right around puberty. That's when the meat is best." 

The grandfather takes a sip of water, but chokes. Water strikes his nostrils and his fit continues. Quite disgusting actually. 

"Any older and they go bad." She looks at her daughter and winks. 

"Old man? Are you ok?" Milly says out of worry. 

The grandfather stand up and spits out a yellow substance onto the plate. 

"DAD!" 

The old man sits down and sighs. " I'm not sure what happened there. You must have mix this with some other food hun. I only wanted the egg not the hen!" He giggled and walked into the other room. 

"Mom? There's a small piece of chicken bone in my egg." 

She puts out her cigarette. 

"You know what? There must have been baby chickens in these eggs. Why don't you run along and I'll cook you something else?" 

Milly got up and spat her food onto the table like her grandfather just did. "Egg no chicken!" And ran upstairs. 

Her mother lit another cigarette. "Damn"
