"What the fuck!" I scream, erratically trying to get out of bed.
"It can't be that many!" 
Finally getting out of my bed, I clearly see the number, and I wasn't mistaken. Seven thousand two hundred and twelve. I have relived this fucking day seven thousand two hundred and twelve times. I get up and put on a pair of gym shorts left at my bedside and run into the kitchen to my phone. I frantically dial in my fiancés number. 
"Hello Sarah?"
"Good morning Ted, what's wrong? You sound worried."
"I....I woke up this morning and...." 
I can't worry her. 
"I like, had a bad dream. I just…. wanted to call and say I love you."
"Well, I love you to Ted!"

It has been two hours now, and nothing monumental has happened. I called my parents and they were fine. Saw my sister pass my apartment complex on her daily running route. Hell, I even went to my local ramen shop to see if Mr. Mokushiroku was alright, but of course he was. So now, I sit on my couch, re-watching Freaks & Geeks, and have already called off work for being sick. 
*
	Six hours after I have woken up. After watching the first four episodes I decided I need to get out of the apartment again. I’m walking to the park feeling the oddly warm afternoon sun hit my skin. I can’t imagine why I would redo this day. Did I have a bad day at work? That’s probably it. It’s already two in the afternoon and nothing bad has happened. I walk down the busy sidewalk a little bit more and  start to smell our local coffee shop and think “why the fuck not?” and decide to treat myself to some expensive ass coffee.
*
	After waiting in line for about half an hour I finally get my coffee and sit down next to a bookshelf off in a corner. It was one of those “leave a book take a book things” and if I remember correctly my favorite book was on these shelves. Even though it has to have been more than a year since I have been here, A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was still there, what better to get my mind off of my worries? I would look up from time to time to look at the TV. It had on some news channel talking about this year’s presidential candidates. I would occasionally hear some talk about it, a “wahta’ joke” once in a while, just keeping my nose in the book until those “whata’ joke”s were traded for “what the fuck?”s. Looking up the two hosts had been switched for red screen with a black banner going across, reading “This is not a drill”. Then everything started to mix together “Get to safety” “Nuclear Warfare”. What about Sarah, what about my life. I needed to fall asleep. I don’t even remember getting up or walking out of the coffee shop, I was already running back home. 
*
	I was throwing everything out of my cabinets. I can’t find anything. I need something to make me fall asleep. Dishes smashed on the floor, my feet bleeding from the glass on the hard wood floor. What do I do, Try and knock myself out? I go to the sink and grab a frying pan that had some burnt egg stuck to it. Okay now I just need to hit myself. Hard, 3….2…..1….. Of course I can’t. I throw the pan into the wall leaving a small hole in it. My eyes started to water. 
‘Why the fuck did I have to get a quad shot. Why today. Whywhywhy….” I yell halfway crying halfway laughing. It seems weird to laugh at, but how ironic is it that I fucked up this badly, with a fucking coffee. Wiping my eyes, I look down seeing the light from the window above the sink go across the kitchen. Along with the shadow was blood, a lot more than I thought there was, mixed in with glass, broken plates, and a weird shadow casting from the window. How could I have forgotten? For the past three years, all of our pills, medications, etc., were kept on the window seal, and since Sarah traveled nonstop, she had a constant supply of restoril. 
*
	An hour in. Over three times the usual dosage, and I’m still awake.
“You’re fucking kidding me” I slur.
	The power has been off for about forty five minutes. I look down to my phone I’ve had in my hands, with that being the only thing working. My lock screen was a picture of me and Sarah at this café in Boston, I can’t remember the name of. It’s weird, everything is quite. In a time of panic I would expect it to be louder than ever, but no. Silence. Then boom. A loud blast. This was it. This was why I have re-lived this day seven thousand two hundred and twelve times, but this time, I just couldn’t fall asleep. I look at my phone one last time with teary eyes, closing them slowly afterwards.
“I love you Sarah”

"What the fuck!" I scream, erratically trying to get out of bed.
"It can't be that many!" 
Finally getting out of my bed, I clearly see the number, and I wasn't mistaken. Seven thousand two hundred and thirteen.
