Thumthumthumthumthumthumthum went the ancient cooling system in the Louisiana humid air. It didn’t do a damn bit of good, but no one cared about it except for a couple hundred prisoners. Guards spent as little time as possible in the dank halls, retreating to their cushy posts, watching on their monitors. Only the occasional fight, riot or gang-sanctioned murder drew them down here, and then not for long.

Was it any wonder, then, that no one had noticed?

I stared at him. Watching the rotten air hiss in and out of him in low burbly things that only resembled snores. Twenty five years old. That’d be my guess. But twenty fucking years in prison? Joe ain’t Asian. I’m goddamn sure that those fuckers have the secret to immortality. At least some of them. But Joe? He still looked the same as the day I first got my bunk across from him.

You don’t notice it at first. Five years went by and he was still young. Just a young guy. Didn’t change much, but who pays attention. Especially to Joe. He’s quiet. Always has been.  Weird. That weird fucking accent, too. You didn’t hear it much, just when he wasn’t paying attention, or was tired, but it was there.

Eight years in? You start to notice. Weird. Ten years, and it bugs you. Twelve, and I was obsessed. When the internet rolled around about a decade and a half after the rest of the world got it, that’s when things got interesting.

Public records were slowly getting scanned and uploaded, and I found Joe’s mug shot. Only… it wasn’t Joe. It was some other guy. Some stranger staring right back at me. There’d been an accident in the prison transport. The bus’d smashed into the river. A dozen inmates died. One lived. Joe. Only he wasn’t Joe.  I’m sitting in a room, in a goddamn jail cell, across from… who? Who is it? Who am I sharing a cell with?

“You’ve noticed.”

I just about jumped out of my skin. I didn’t think he knew I was looking. He turned those eyes on me. Oh, there was nothing off about the eyes. It was THE LOOK. Where whatever was hidden inside him would swim up to the surface, and it was like looking back at something… bigger. Like a guy wearing a skin suit that didn’t quite fit him.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

He smiled. He didn’t even need to say it. He knew.

He came across the room, and sat down next to me. Right next to me. On my bunk. I slipped my hand down behind the mattress, reaching for my shiv - just a filed down plastic fork - but it wasn’t there.

“You’ve noticed.”

Again, it wasn’t a question. I nodded. I didn’t mean to. But I did. My throat felt too tight. Like I couldn’t breathe.

“What are you? The devil? Some… vampire?” I asked. He seemed amused.

“No. I’m not those things.”

“You killed 12 people. To keep this secret.”

He nodded, seeming tired. “More. More than that. But yes, that too. And I’m not sure yet.”

"About… what?"

“About you.”

“What are you? Why are you here?”

“There are things that exist in your world. Things that you sense, moving beneath the currents, beneath the reflective skin of this thing you call reality. Sometimes… they come to the surface, breaking for just a moment, and you realize they are there. But for the most part? You spend your lives ignoring the signs, clinging in ignorance to the tiny little layer of reality your brains can comprehend.”

“But what ARE you.”

“I am the sacrifice. The hostage. I am the bargain that keeps you safe. As long as I am here, so are you.”

“Jesus.” I swore.

“Yes.” He replied. “Arcane, and somewhat inaccurate. But yes.”

“What are you going to do with me?”

“I could do what I’ve done with the others. I could kill you, and carry on. I could wait, trust you. I’ve done that before as well. But…” he sighed “I grow… weary… of this all. You are interesting, but how interesting cn you be after two thousand year? No, I will not kill you. I think, instead, I will leave. There is a universe of things to explore out there.”

I let out a sigh of relief, seeing the decision made in his eyes. Alive. I was ALIVE.

“Thank you.” I said.

“For what?” he said.

“For sparing me.”

He looked at me, unreadable, and then he was gone. Vanished. And I sat there listening to the  ThrumThrumThrum of the struggling air conditioning, still failing to beat back the heat. And as I lay there, it struck me: The hostage. The bargain. What had he meant by that? The hostage against… what?

And then the walls shivered. Stone like water on lake on a moonless night, only the dim stars to light the way. And SOMETHING, some THINGS began to surface. 

And in the distance the screams began.
