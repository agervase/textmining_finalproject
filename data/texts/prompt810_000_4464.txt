How hard can it be, taking a gun to a knife fight? I mean, they're swords, but swords are just really big knives, so the sentiment holds true. The princess, so fair under the spring sun, eagerly watched on. We shared a glance, a smile, before my theatrics began.

"I will show you all the power of my magic," I said, the robed man across from me lurking beneath his hood. We stayed face to face, slowly rotating in a circle. "Watch as I kill this man without even moving."

I pulled the trigger on a gun tucked into my loose sleeve. It tore a hole in it, and the sound jolted the crowd. It was clear that my words were no bluff.

Not that it mattered.

Where the bullet should have hit him, a little pond of blue rippled, like a stone dropped into water. Slowly, he drew back his hood.

I hadn't aged very well, but it was no doubt *me*. Wrinkled, scarred, and fucking miserable eyes like overcooked eggs. He shook his head at me.

"Sorry, kiddo." Something around his wrist glowed red, whirring, humming.

"No, wait! Why? What the fuck are you doing here, killling me? I mean, you?"

"She's fucking crazy, kid. Like, absolute batshit bonkers. Time is stupid. If I let you beat me, you get stuck with her and turn into me. But if I kill you, then both our sufferings end." He raised his arm at me.

"Wait, just fucking *wait*." 

He rolled his eyes, wrist lowering a bit. "What?"

"Well, I have a gun, and you have some crazy ass lasers and shit."

"And?"

I raised my arm and painted the royal banner with princess brains. The crowd was not exactly pleased, and the king was screaming something I didn't recognize.

"Huh. Why didn't I think of that?" old me asked.

I looked at myself and smiled. "You did."
