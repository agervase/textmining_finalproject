Tomorrow is the day.

The anticipation, the raw excitement, is beginning to get to me again, like it does every year.  At first, this world was filled with wonder.  Racks of books and knowledge, rising high above me.  As far back as I can remember, this has been my life.  Day in, day out.  Another book.  Another lesson.

But after a while, that wonder began to pale.  There are so many books in the world to read, so much knowledge to be had.  Every time I think I've reached mastery, another door opens in front of me.  Another rack appears.  More knowlege to gain.  And the library is quiet.  I'm not certain that I could speak anymore, even if I had someone here to speak with.  Which I don't.

But rarely - so rarely - I get to go into the other world.  At first I thought it was a dream, but without fail this dream keeps coming back.  A world filled with color, and experiences, and faces, and voices, and noise.

Once a year, I become someone else.  I passed my three thousandth year some time ago.  And after all these years, my calculations are *perfect*. Tomorrow *is* the day, that I will cross over into the *other* world for a day. My calendar is without flaw.

Tomorrow, I turn nine, by theirs.

They haven't realized, of course.  Every night I go into this dream world, they don't recognize that within that tiny body is a mind *thousands* of years older than them.  They merely coo nonsensically about how precocious I am, and toss around words like 'gifted'.  'Talented'.  'Blessed'.

But I hear them.  And I *understand*.  This world, this dream that I have been given, is a challenge.  In another three thousand years, I'll be an 'adult' by their standards.  Capable.  Respected.  And they'll have no idea how outmatched they are.

So I bide my time, and read my books, and wait.

This world is a game.  And it's one I intend on winning.

Edit - All right,  I'm going to start working on future chapters of this.  Going to have to restructure a little too make it functional long term so expect to see some *very minor* tweaks to what I've written here (stuff like ages).  Future chapters will be on the aforementioned vanity sub!  Thanks for all your nice comments!
