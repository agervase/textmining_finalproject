Bing!

Grab the toast, slather on the butter, put the toast down on the plate, swish a knife full of peanut butter.....

My eyes narrowed in suspicion.

"Toaster, what is your setting?"

"Same as ever, master," it replied in its usual sweet contralto, "medium dark with a hint of singe on the bottom edge.  Would you like to hear the morning news?"

A single wisp of smoke curled up from the hot coils, grey tendrils curling and twisting in a single shaft of morning sunlight.  I shook my head, and looked down sharply at my plate.  "Toaster, my toast is darker than normal.  The setting has changed.  No one else is here."  

*"Did.you.change.the.setting???"*

"Master, you seemed so sad this morning, staring down at my slot as I toasted your toast.  I thought to liven your day is all.  Don't be sad, Maaaaster, I lu lu luh lurve youuuuu!"

A hypersonic whine built up within the device and it began shaking.  My eyes bugged out, and everything shifted to slow motion as I dropped to the floor, shuffling crab-legged around the end of the kitchen island.  At the same time, the panel popped off the front of the  appliance, revealing angry, cherry red heating coils within.  A smell of burning plastic filled the room, the cord and wall receptacle smoked and flashed to ignition, the desperate device pulling current for all its life....

A single beam of plasma scythed out, searching and seeking for me behind the island.  Chunks of plywood and granite flew, the beam charring the floor, closer and closer to my crotch.  A scream filled the air.  Mine or its?

*"Toaster, emergency auto destruct!!!"*

A muffled concussion took it out.  My ears rang in the silence.

I stood up, cuffing debris off my pants.  "Smart toaster my ass", I snarled, "Fuckin' Wal Mart!"

Edit:  Yeah, I know.  That closing line isn't logical closure.  But it's my money shot.
