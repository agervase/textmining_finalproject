Jake Sully rushed himself through the door of the Starbucks on 38th and Island Ave. The parade across town made this neck of the woods dead, so he threw a 10 dollar bill on the counter, sputtered out "Venti Latte" and threw himself into the bathroom at the back of the coffee shop. He barely had time to sit down, let alone think "Why do i keep eating Taco Bell?" before the most gut wrenching shit he had ever taken began pouring out of him.

&#x200B;

As he finished up ruining his day, he was wondering where he might buy some talcum powder this early when the voice chimed in his head.

&#x200B;

"five billion, Jake"

&#x200B;

Jake blinked and twisted his eyes questioningly. Sometimes when he made big life decisions it would say numbers in the dozens. He remembered when he pulled that odd old man out of the street down on Viejo it said eighty-six...

&#x200B;

"Five billion, my ass" Jake said under his breath as he winced from the reminder.

&#x200B;

He got up, washed his hands, and walked out the door. He had barely taken a step when a hand grabbed him, gently but firmly,  by the shoulder. Jake spun around eyes wide open, his gaze met with an older gentleman in a suit and glasses.

&#x200B;

"Jake this isn't going to make any sense for a while. That toilet collects the fecal data of everyone that uses it. The Government then uses that data for biological research that is at the cutting edge of science... I need you to come with me. I'd like you to come on your own, but..."

&#x200B;

His voice trailed off as he nodded toward the six men in black suits and sunglasses in a semi circle around Jake. It was at this time Jake realized the Starbucks had been cleared out and it was at this point he realized it was probably a good idea to go with the men...

&#x200B;

***Several weeks later***

&#x200B;

"We need more! We're so close to where we need to be!"

&#x200B;

"I'm pushing him as hard as I can, you'll get your sample when its ready, damn it!"

&#x200B;

Jake could hear the men outside his "room" screaming at each other. For the past 3 weeks, he thought it was 3 weeks at least, he had been locked.. somewhere. They covered his head in the van he got into back in the city. Since then he had awoken in a warm, cozy, familiar room with a TV, entertainment system, King Size bed, and the nicest bathroom he had ever seen. He had certainly gotten to know the bathroom. Everything he had eaten since his arrival was some sort of super fiber or another. Oat brand, Fiber One, Plums, nothing put things that kept him going. It had been briefly explained to him that something in his bodies waste was *different* and they needed a lot of it, but his explanations had been few and far between. He was growing restless and the stress on his body was immense.

&#x200B;

A man approached his windowed door. He typed the code in and let himself inside.

&#x200B;

" One, Eight, Seven, Six, Nine.. Jake Sully. Good to finally meet the man I've been studying so much."

&#x200B;

Jake stared blankly.

&#x200B;

"Where are my manners, forgive me. I am Dr. Geroux, advanced science team lead researcher for project. U.N.O. I'm sorry to have kept you in the dark for so long, but this project is really need to know information, and while you are the most essential part of it, you don't need to know."

&#x200B;

"Why the hell are you taking all my poop." Jake had been here for too long not to be blunt.

&#x200B;

"Jake... In a perfect world you would be owed all the explanations. This world is not perfect, not yet at least."

&#x200B;

Dr. Geroux idly moved closer to Jake, his hands behind his back.

&#x200B;

"I'm very sorry for your stay here. I need you to know you'll be widely remembered as the most important man to have lived for millennia from now. We need something else from you though-"

&#x200B;

The doctor's hand was too fast. Jake felt a sharp pain in his side where a huge syringe had pierced him. He sleepily stared into Geroux's eyes, and before he knew it his mind was blank, off.

&#x200B;

He awoke in the Starbucks bathroom on 38th and Island.

&#x200B;

"That was a fucking weird day dream"

&#x200B;

Jake Sully finished up his post credits Taco Bell battle and left the bathroom when a hand grabbed him.

&#x200B;

A man dressed in a silk suit closed the laptop displaying the CCTV feed of this "Jake Sully" he had heard so much about.

&#x200B;

"I told you, we've had him in that thought loop for *four hundred and fourty two* cycles and he has chosen the martyr role without putting up a fight once. 'Fecal assessment?' that is such a load of bullshit. He knows in the back of his mind once he goes in that lab, hes never coming out. He resigns to it because he thinks he's the hero. I'm telling you for the last time, Jake Sully is the ONLY candidate for this job."

&#x200B;

The man in the silk suit had walked across the room to pour himself a glass of brandy. He looked across the stars in his view and closed his eyes, resigning to this path. He turned to the other man, and in the commanding tone only the *President of the United States* could muster shot out

&#x200B;

"Give that man the suit."

&#x200B;
