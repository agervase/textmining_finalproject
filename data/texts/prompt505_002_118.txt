A drunken man stumbled into Valhalla. How a mortal managed to stumble his way onto another of the Nine worlds not even Odin could explain, nor could the man. But any man who could confidently walk up to feasting gods and exclaim, in broken Russian, that he could out drink any one of them certainly deserved his revelry just as much as any of them did.

This drunk mortal refused to name himself, and just shouted that he was 'The Machine' and kept demanding alcohol. Many Ã†sir were offended by him, but in the midst of this feast, many more simply delighted in the entertainment. Dyngir Aegirson was the most interested of them all. Kindred spirits they were: both boasted about how much drink they could hold, and both, as it seemed, delighted in sports that defended these claims. But no mortal could ever hope to out drink a god, especially not Dyngir. He was the only being to have beaten Thor in a drinking contest. This contest had lasted 9 days and 10 nights, ending with Thor slumped in a bench and Dyngir finishing off Thor's half full mug. Odin had named him God of Merriment after this, and thrown a feast in his honor. The very same feast The Machine happened to be crashing.

Dyngir confronted the man after a solid minute of The Machines mostly unintelligible ramblings about frat boys and corrupt Russian police officers. He accepted The Machines challenge of drink and they were both eventually sat across each other with new full mugs of fresh brew set before them in turn. Most of what Dyngir said to The Machine at this point was lost on him. All he knew was that there was booze, this man had accepted his challenge, and he was The Machine. So he drank.

And he drank

And he drank

And continued to drink long past anyone thought was possible. Aegir's Ale was a powerful drink, it was after all brewed by a god and was to be consumed by gods. The fact this mortal could drink one mug was an astounding feat. The Machine didn't really care though. He just kept chugging.
