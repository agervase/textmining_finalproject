“Is it Magga Glen sad?”

Such were the words that became common before the Great Revolution. It was at Magga Glen where the Welsh were entrusted with the Lektor, the key to advanced science using Dark Matter. It began with takeovers in the scientific world, followed by political blackmail. Soon Alwyn Afon, the New Queen of the Lektor Welsh, had the world in the palm of her hand, through the development of powerful weapons far beyond the capabilities of any other. Thus began the first reign of a Welsh Earth.

Cities were split, and renamed. Even today you will find hundreds of cities known as Cardiff, remnants of the time. Councils were subjugated, and turned. Even against her own people Alwyn was cruel, and she began a campaign of mass human experimentation. Her case was a near perfect example of the phrase, 

“Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

She had no council, no checks and balances. There no longer was a coalition, nor alliances. Only the House of Magga Glen, the Arms of Magga Glen, the Eve of Magga Glen.

In a unique twist of fate it was her own faction that turned against her first, deciding the best course was to share the Lektor at last. But first was the world rallied. Gone was the Eve of Magga Glen, gone was the blind faith the faction of Alwyn had in their queen. She had turned tyrant, and a Great Revolution was needed.

“Y chwyldro newydd!”

This was the phrase that united people against the tyrannical Alwyn. Her courtesans and artisans, her businessmen and advisors, all turned against her. Then, as she slept, always at her side a loyal Welsh guard as a result of her paranoia against outsiders, she was killed.

The world had been freed from the tyranny of Alwyn.

Now was the Age of the Lektor.
