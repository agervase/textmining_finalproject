With bags under my eyes, I shrugged in defeat. My Mistress of Magic, she would have known where I went wrong. I placed a simple magical seal on my... work, and quickly went to bed. The journey to arrive to this unceremonious conclusion, the candle placement, the alignment of the stars, and one bag of tiny marshmallows, I was thoroughly awash with fatigue.   


I remember my dreams being vivid that evening, they always were in points of exhaustion, but this evening felt real, and I've seen quite a lot studying under my Mistress.  


I awoke and pulled the curtain from my Tower window, a day of late fall, with minor overcast and the untrammeled mountainside in full display of the autumn colors. A dew had set from what was no doubt an early rain in the morning. In my failure I felt a moment of serenity from peering out that tiny window.  


But as I peered into my quarters, everything was different. Everything was tidy. I lose all sense of cleanliness in my pursuit for the Arts. Did my dream invoke a spell? I rushed down to my incantation chamber, and the lemon was gone. I gathered the remnants of the tattered Spell Seal, after all with some interdimensional anything can be fixed. And I heard a sultry voice from the doorway, "My apologies, I save that mess for last."  


I looked up and a humanoid seemed to shine golden-white light stood in the doorway. I asked who they were, and she snickered, motioning to the broken seal, "Isn't it obvious novice?" My heart sunk into my gut.  


"You have summoned me, your new mentor. We will learn three things at my leisure, Tidiness, Posture, and DAMNATION AHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAAHAA!!!" She cackled away. It was at that moment I remembered my mentor's oldest maxim:  


Every  
Villain  
Is  
Lemons
