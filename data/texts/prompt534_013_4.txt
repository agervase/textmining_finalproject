It was late at night when my mother gave birth to me. In a small house on top of a mountain, thunder and lightning giving their own scary version of applause. It was a stormy night and the shack barely held up. But it did and it still does 18 years later. Tonights my birthday and as everyone in this world, i will be visited by death. What will he give me? How about an ancient book with so much knowledge! Or a simple sword or spear? Gifts from Death will never break and always be useful...
Living up here in the mountains, i think speaking with animals would be useful and very entertaining!

Suddenly the door springs open and Death moves in very swiftly. A dark silhouette, hidden in black clothing and a silvery scythe in hand. The scythe was kept very simple, no patterns or inscriptions. No playful design for the blade. Just a simple scythe.

"Listen boy, I am Death and I give the most suitable gift to every 18 year old human. I don't have much time, busy day and you live in the middle of nowhere. So here's your gift."

He holds the scythe towards me, this is my gift?

"Wait, does that mean i will be Death? I don't want that! Please give me another gift!"

"What? No! This is just a scythe to mow the fields. Why would i cary a scythe all around with me? I'm a magical being and you think i would take this stupid heavy piece of metal bullshit with me? It was hard enough to get it up here, i missed my teleport and had to walk! 
You will never be Death! No one will ever. You arrogant humans think that you deserve everything. But you don't! Be happy that an incredible mighty being such as myself is willing to help your pitiful race!"

And with that he vanished.
