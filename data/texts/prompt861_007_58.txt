"Mr. President...we can't just mobilize our armies to take down General Mills on your premise that "they tried to assassinate you via pizza roll,"" the leader of France began to explain.

But Donald Trump immediately interjected, "Fran√ßois Hollande, I'm a smart man. And I can tell General Mills is a smart man too."

"He's not even a real person..."

"It's a typical war strategy."

"Not even a real general..."

"Don't put warning labels on the pizza rolls to burn your enemies mouths. It's diabolical. Mills probably has his sniper on me right now to stop me from talking," Trump spoke as he continually shuffled left and right attempting to dodge the bullet.

"Mr. President, we are getting nowhere with the real issue at hand with your constant interruptions," shouted the infuriated Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain.

Each leader of their respective nations began to voice their growing discontent with the outlandish behavior of Trump until they all managed to agree to lock Trump in a separate room "to protect him from the General". With Trump out of the way, they discuss a way to prevent further generations of leaders from being this idiotic. Finally, the Darwin Act was passed which removed all warning labels, so that the "strongest may survive".

Two months later, the United Nations convened to discuss more pressing issues. But the President was missing. The crowd of world leaders become increasingly restless and gossiped to one another.

"Maybe it worked."

"It couldn't have. It wasn't suppose to kill him - only hinder him."

"Regardless of what it was suppose to do, he's not present and we need him to start. For God's sake it's about his damn country."

On the other side of the world, in the White House, Trump lies lifeless on the floor in a pool of his own blood with a half opened can of Cambell's tomato soup and a hammer.
