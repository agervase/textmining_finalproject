I sat alone in my garden watching the world burn. I hadn't seen my neighbour Mr. Stilts for a while. I guess he was probably dead already. I continued sipping my coffee as I saw a familiar figure walking towards me. Was it time then?

*******************

There is a fine line between life and death. Right now, I'm on the right side, but I do wish I wasn't. The human body is strong and that's what makes it worse. If my body would just break down, if I could just die, then the pain would stop. And right now, I'd do anything to make it stop. 

I wonder how long I've been here. But the dark messes with your perception of time. There are no windows here. I don't even know if it is day or night. And the loneliness. Humans, as a rule are social animals. Not talking to, not interacting with anyone goes directly against our nature. Well, to be fair, I'm not strictly alone. She is here occasionally. She is gorgeous, but she just sits there watching. Expressionless.

"Hey. Hey you! Talk to me. Say something. I'm gonna go crazy."

To my surprise, she smiles. She is in a long black dress, just like always, her platinum hair and fair skin forming a stark contrast. She is wearing some flowers in her hair. Roses, I think. But it is hard to tell since they are dead and withered. But I still get a faint whiff every now and then. She walks towards me and runs her hand against my cheek. My entire life flashes across my eyes and despite my situation, I'm somehow filled with joy. I can't explain why, but I am happy beyond words.

"Hello Skal."

Her voice is beautiful. I just look at her, speechless.

"You've wanted me to talk for so long. And now you won't even answer me?"

"I... Who are you?"

"I'm an angel..."

"I can see that."

"... of death."

I stare at her curiously.

"You don't look like it."

"What did you think I would look like?"

"Well, scary for one."

"There is nothing more scary than beauty. You will come to realize that one day."

"Well, I guess my time has come. And to be honest, I'm glad. A quick death would be preferable to this drawn out process."

She just looked at me with that faint smile.

"Well?"

"I'm thinking." She went back to the corner and sat back down.

"What is there to think about? I want to die. You can make that happen."

But she didn't say anything. She just sat there staring. I kept looking at her and don't know when I fell asleep.

I was woken up by a gentle shaking. She stood there. Once again, her touch took me back to my best memories and I was giddy with happiness.

"Fuck Destiny. I'm getting you out of here."

I blinked a few times looking at her. 

"Do you trust me?"

Now that she was close to me, I could smell the dead roses. The smell was intoxicating. Her earrings shone in the darkness. A strand of loose hair fell over her face.

"I... I do."

She smiled again and waved her hand. The cell doors fell open.

"Wait." She waited for a few seconds and then indicated me to follow her. And I did. God help me, I did.

*********************

I lay down my cup of coffee as she came and sat opposite me. 

"Long time no see."

"How have you been Skal."

"Did you know?"

"Did I know what?"

"Don't act ignorant. This. All of this. Did you know this would happen."

"Didn't you?"

"Of course not. I only wanted to do good."

She moved her hand towards me but I shrank back.

"Don't touch me."

"Well, I'm afraid that's going to be hard. Your time has come."

"You bastard."

She smiled again. 

"I was just a tool for you wasn't I? A tool to give you millions of souls? You knew what my medicine would do. You knew of the side effects. You made me into a murderer."

She shrugged. Her face hardening. "Accidents happen."

"This was no accident. You did this."

"No. YOU did this."

Anger overtook me as I swung my fist. But I was a mere mortal. Her eyes widened as I was flung from my chair with an unseen force. I fell down a few feet away.

Her face had transformed into something different. The smile was replaced by a smirk which filled me with fear. Her hair turned into serpents. She floated towards me. I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.

I felt someone shake me. I opened my eyes as a middle aged man stood above me.

"Skal, we better hurry."

"Who? Who are you?"

"I'm Destiny. Fuck Death, I'm getting you out of here."

"But..."

"If you have the ability to kill, you also have the ability to save. Come, we need to get you a new destiny."
