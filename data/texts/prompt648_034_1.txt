It took a while to build this hut.
I didn't have much thatch for the roof at the time so I had to go and buy some on a different farm.

I am happy though, even with all the effort I have put into this small hut.

I didn't like the idea of building this hut at first, just because, I didn't see the point in building such a small hut, considering that I could build a bigger hut for my chickens.

I do see know, why I built this hut.

Somewhere deep in my head, I always thought that there were gods, beings that influenced our world in many ways. Beings that just need the proper site to manifest in our world.

Anyway, I wont get into what I believe in my head.

After the hut was built, I left it for a night, and came back in the morning to see a bar of solid gold in the hut. Me in my excitement, I decide to touch the gold bar, to try and move it, but as soon as I touch it, I froze. I could hear a voice calling in my head. I looked around to check if there was anything that could have made that sound, but there was nothing to be seen

I heard the voice again, only much clearer this time. It said in a quiet, whisper filled voice, "You wretched beings love the sight of something that will get you money, a materialistic thing that is the root of corruption." I called out "Who is this? What are you?"

The voice answered, "I am Untia, the forgotten god of wealth and knowledge."
"What do you want from me?" I cried.
"I want you to help me."
"With what?"
"You must kill the owner of the farm that you bought the thatch."
My eyes widened like a black hole growing bigger.
I couldn't process what I heard.
I don't think anyone could.

"Mortal, serve me and you will gain wealth and lost knowledge for as long as you wish."
I'm so confused on what to do.

What should I do?
