No one really understands what caused it, but history talks of the day the sky stopped falling. They speak of giant chasms just filled with the sky, as weird as that sounds - but not anymore. Humanity evolved to embrace the change, migrants no longer fled to the countries in Europe or America, instead they traveled down the mountains to present day Atlantica and began life anew.


History speaks of the the dark ages, where the Great Sky Riots occurred for nearly a hundred years, people terrified to go outside and groups fighting for the inevitable day when the sky would again fall and wash the world away.


My name is John. It's been millennia since those times, and the Great Sky Wars a long lost memory. I was a member of the Skywatchers, a religion that came to popularity a long, long time ago. They believed that one day our lord would return and wash away all those but the true believers. I didn't really believe in all the superstition, but I'd grown up following their beliefs and still went to morning service each friday. I had been at service all morning but was heading back to my office to wrap up some things before the weekend. It had been a hell of a week and I was just ready to take some time off and unwind down at the park.


I walk up to my office building and reach out to open the door and something drops onto my arm. Curious, I look down and see some clear liquid, I hold up my arm and just stare at it.


"What is that?" Someone next to me asks.


"I ... don't know." I say, just transfixed by the liquid. I look up at the sky and then back down at my arm.


"John, is that.... sky?" a coworker asks me.


Everyone in the vicinity gets quiet and just stares at me.


"Oh god ... the sky is falling."
