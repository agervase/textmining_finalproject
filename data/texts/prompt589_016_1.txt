Who is god (respect the lower case disrespect here) of course is an elected potion BY us. The more people of the world think one god or some profit bullshit is real the more powerful they become and the other ones have to sit in a room and play cards.

Is 2016 tho one day fed up the god of the time decides he just wants to make pancakes and jacks it all in.
Suddenly all the lesser belief systems the ones without as many followers start to compete with each other to see who is really in charge.
This turns nasty as some are very very old world and can get away with some of the darker parts of the books they got people to write their rules down in.
While most sections of these books have become ignored due to progress an=s we kept the being nice to each other parts - which is what happens with the most powerful ones the lesser ones have all kinds of crazy stuff in.

This allows them to show off with rules that allow them all the do some mad stuff to make themselves stand out and be noticed as well.

The flying spaghetti monster people all start wearing colanders on there head all the time and have nightmare going through TSA screening cos no matter how most people think they can choose to use a plastic colander there are those who strictly believe that the metal one is the REAL and only way to worship correctly.

So now to compete the believers who want the power, who want their god to be in charge get real crazy and start fights with each other. Most fights are one sided tho as the only people who really want to be in charge should never be allowed to be.

So is this a story or not?
