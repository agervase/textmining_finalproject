Finally, mercifully, it was all coming to the End. For aeons, I've been cleaning up after that jackass. I'd say I don't know why our parents put up with him for so long, but he was always the favorite twin. Mom created an entire freakin' universe for him, just so he could go around and fart bacteria on all those wet balls of dirt. If that wasn't bad enough, Dad made it so all the random universe junk could move around, but he always had too much time on his hands so what do you expect.
 
Everyone always loved my brother, the precious little life boy who made everyone. Made everyone have to eat and shit and touch each other and be really god-damn stupid all the time. Well guess who always had to clean up after him, year after year, animal after animal, every single time. 

 I'm used to the fear and scorn from all the "gifts of life" he'd dump on me. All the pain I had to inflict. But I've never escaped the misery. The disgusting people I had to obey in service to whatever vicious agendas were in vogue. He'd be there at the start, sure, the part where everyone's happy and full of hope, celebrating him. But I had to be there at the end, where no one's happy. 

So here we are now, about to hit the real End. Only one last job. I thought it would be easy after all he's put me through, his careless innocence. But its not. It isn't even that I won't be around either once he's gone, in fact if anything that's a blessing. I think it's because I wish we could have been better brothers, even friends, but he never cared to try. Oh well. Once again, I'm at the end, where no one's happy.
