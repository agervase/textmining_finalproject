It was 2115 and I was still the same 24 year old Sam as I was 146 years ago. 

In 2078 there’s was a bombing of the United Stated and more than half the population died. The people who were left went to the large cities around the country like Miami, Huston, Los Angles, or New York City. 

Because of the radiation exposure after the nuclear bombs went off, some people like myself got superpowers. I know it sounds cliché  like Spider-Man, but it’s true. All different people with all different powers. Most of us have stayed hidden since the powers are nothing like flying or shooting lasers, but there are the occasional few who come out as vigilantes or villains. My power you may ask...? Immortality.

My life in what used to be New York City is, as you would expect, all hustle and bustle with a little less population. At least that didn’t change after the bombing. Every few years I have to switch places since people would start to notice that I didn’t age, but there was one constant in my life no matter where I went. 

Morgan was another one of the people affected by the bombings. They used to live in what was Freeport Maine; right where one of the 17 bombs hit. Out of all the supers, I think they got the most useful power. They have the ability to time travel. They’re the same age as me. Well the same age as I was when the bomb hit; 24. And they can travel to any time in space that has ever been or ever will be. 

But I don’t see them for their power like most people do. I see them for their love, for their compassion, and for their need to protect everyone they holds dear. I love Morgan, but they will never know.

Some more supers have come out of the shadows and the general populous is starting to accept them into everyday life. Since I look like a normal human, I’m trying to stay hidden. It might like kind of odd that I up and move every few years, but I’m still hidden. 

Morgan and I have become closer as well over the past four years! Morgan figured out how to take people back with her, but forward is a little harder. So for a day trip, we went back to Egypt circa 30 B.C.E. 

This was was the year Cleopatra Died and Egypt fell under Roman rule. At the time, we didn’t know that, so we thought we were going for a good time. Not what we got.

We got there in the early morning, and started our day. We went to the pyramids, the Sphinx, and sailed the Nile. All was well! That was until the fire nation attacked. Nah, just kidding. It was going well and good until we got caught on the Nile by the Pharaohs guards for trespassing on sacred land. 

Morgan and I were taken to a sort of jail where we were questioned for our clothing, hair, and shoes. We told them we are from the future, but they did not believe us. That was until we got a request from the Queen to come visit her. 

We went to the Queen, Cleopatra, and sat down in her throne room. The guards told us not to move so, we didn’t. Morgan and I were so scared. We kept looking at each other as if we could communicate telepathically to say ‘what do we do now?’. We were panicking and it felt like an eternity later when Cleopatra finally entered with her guards. 

Her entrance was spectacular. Getting to meet one of the most famous and powerful women in history was amazing. But that spectre didn’t last. The Queen sent her guards away, and once they were out of the room, she proceeded to talk to us. “I’ve heard rumours that you two have come from the future. Is that true? If so, how did you come here? And why?” 

The questions were fast and came quickly so Morgan and I tried our best to answer. 

“We are from earth in the year 2119 and yes, the rumours are true. We are travelling in time with my power, which as you could probably gather, is time travel. We only came here to have fun, and go on a short time trip to see what we could do. Nothing nefarious.” 

Morgan said all of this with an air of calmness surrounding her like this has happened to her before. I quickly give her a look of suspicion and questioning, but return to the task at hand. 

“And you...” 

At this point the Queen was referring to me. 

“Who are you who travel with this — Morgan...?” 

The question had an authoritative tone to it, commanding my answer. 

“My name is Sam, and my power, if you could call it that, is immortality.”

The Queen looked at the two of us with questioning eyes and the body language that she was wary of us, but we could see the gears of a plan forming in her head. She spoke again.

“Immortality and the ability to travel in time you say? Why not gift these to me and I will let you live and have your freedom. If not, I will take it from you then execute you where you stand.”

This was obviously not how it worked and neither of us knew how she thought it worked either. This whole thing was a lot more than we bargained for... 

“Miss, if I may, how do you think our powers work exactly? If you’re right we will give you what you want, but if you’re wrong, we will leave.”

Morgan was walking a thin line between safety and death with saying this to one of the most powerful people ever, and I think we are about to fall. 

With one wave of her hand, the guards came into the room, and took us to a prison cell. One of the things that Morgan’s power needs to work is calm, and time to recharge between uses, which we didn’t have. We didn’t know how long we were going to be in here so we talked. I was in a frenzy since I thought we were going to die. So I had to tell Morgan how I felt. I couldn’t keep t bottled up if we were to parish.

“Morgan” 

“Sam”

We both spoke at the same time...

“You go first Sam. What do you need to say?”

Morgan spoke this with almost a look of sadness, but hope as well.

“Morgan, ever since I met you, you have been the only constant in my life. For the past, I don’t even know how long now, I’ve admired you, I’ve loved you. If it wasn’t for you, I’d be alone and scared and vulnerable to everyone. But when I’m with you I feel safe and cared for and like I have a friend. What I’m trying to say is, Morgan, I love you.”

I said this with such passion and vigour, I brought myself to tears. Morgan as well was crying. Did I do something wrong?!

“Sam—“

She paused to wipe her eyes but I thought she was going to reject me so I interjected.

“Um nevermind that Morgan... I was talking crazy. I’m just panicking...”

“Sam, what I was going to say was that I love you too—“

But she could barely get it out before a guard came in and hit the two of us to the cold, stony floor, hitting our heads and knocking us both out...
