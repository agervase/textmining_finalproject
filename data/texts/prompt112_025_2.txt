I'll give it a go: 

15,000 the big 15-O. The world sure has changed alot. Most ghost only got to live an extra decade or two before passing on but not me I've been here for 15,000 years and counting. I don't know how I'm still around anyone who knew me personally has been long gone but somehow I still find myself flattered. I never thought of myself as anything special but clearly I must have been or I wouldn't be here. I rolled onto my back and watched the stars over head slowly swirl above me. 

I used to rest in peoples homes but quickly learned that I became too attached to people whom I'd only outlive. My heart ached whenever I thought of it so I opted to live in the dwindling forests of the world amoungst the stars and landscapes who's lifespans could match mine. And as I eased into my surroundings my anxious thoughts plagued me again. 

I didn't know who out there could ever remember me, I didn't do much. Or at least I don't feel like I did. I tried for years to think of what I did to possibly make it this far and yet nothing ever came to mind. 

Newton suggested to me that perhaps I made some scientific discovery, but honestly I think the pompous arse was just trying to rub it in my face that he knew exactly what he would be remembered for. The other spirits really weren't of much help in such matters as they would either gossip about how far mankind got with their discoveries or follow their families until they eventually passed on. I hated to admit it but I was actually quiet jealous. I longed for that sense of purpose that faded away so long ago and left me with nothing but questions and an ever changing world I would never be a part of. 

-sorry guys I kinda fell off the rails here and list my point-
