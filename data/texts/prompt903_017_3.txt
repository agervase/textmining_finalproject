Our shitters are gender neutral. Well, let’s just say neutral since most of these lowlifes have too many holes and parts to be useful for anything resembling sex. When these jerks come in from the bar, all semblance of civility goes right down the commode with their excretions when they manage to get it in the actual commode. An asshole, a literal asshole monster had floated in here ten minutes ago and fled the bar shortly after, leaving behind a trail of purple goo worming from the restroom door to the exit portal. 

“Jesus Christ,” I said scanning the broad purple whooshes on the walls. It was like a child’s wall mural masterpiece of levity and playfulness. Through the smoke of my gnawed cigar, the smell of freshly picked rose petals smashed with a turd hammer crawled up my nose and refused to leave. Wisps of acidic vapor rose from the floor where chunks of purple separated from that on the wall and splattered down.

The nozzled hose I carried in with me was my typical tactical loadout for shitter duty. A fifty meter hi-pressure plastic tube fed back behind the bar to a nozzle flanked by a dainty shrine to a few low-on-the-totem-pole, but morally decent, deities. Squeezing the nozzle summoned a quick liquid blessing, a harsh spiritual solvent for those dirty jobs. A blast of rainbowed sparkle juice coned from the nozzle and cut through the purple goo, thinning it, causing it to run down the walls, pool on the floor and finally circle into the drain.

Just outside the restroom I asked the nearby blob sitting at a table nursing a Miller Lite, “Yog, teach that asshole to use the goddamn commode will ya?”

Most of Yog-Sothoth’s eyes left the television and spun around to gaze into the nethers of my soul. They blinked in unison. That usually means it agrees.
