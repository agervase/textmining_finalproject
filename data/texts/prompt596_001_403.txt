“Please don’t do this. Please. There are other ways, there are other things we haven’t tried yet. You don’t have to ….” She broke off with a sob. 

“Yes, I do…. I have to. You know what is at stake if I don’t.” He looked into her eyes, silently pleading for her to understand. He knew she never would. This would destroy her, which is why this was even possible in the first place. 

She was always so optimistic, so willing to give everything for anyone and everyone. It is one of the many things he loved about her. As he looked at her, truly saw everything she was, he knew that he was making the right decision. 

Taking her in his arms, he held her as tight as he could. She buried her head into his chest and wrapped her arms around his waist. He gently stroked her hair as he whispered over and over again, “I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry.” 

With a thought and a sharp gesture of his left hand, he vanished. The woman was left holding nothing but air and with a piercing cry of despair collapsed to the ground. Her hands sought for him. She knew he was still there, even if she could not see or feel him. He was in the Outside. He was doing it. He was gone forever. 

It was dark in the Outside. He had spent decades learning its intricate lessons and complex stories. It was a comfortable home for him. One of peace and thoughtful contemplation. This would not last. 

With precise movements and clear words, he began his spell. It was necessary, he told himself. As the portal to the Inside opened, he only thought of her. After punctuating the last word of his spell with an emphatic horizontal slicing motion with both hands, the portal stood fully open. 

“HELLO WANDERER. WHY HAVE YOU SUMMONED ME?”

“I have need of you old friend. Today I save the light of my world by giving up the light of my world.”

“AS ALWAYS YOU SPEAK IN RIDDLES. YOU KNOW THE COST OF MY POWER. WHAT MEMORIES DO YOU GIVE FOR MY AID?”

“All of them.”

His world exploded in fire.
