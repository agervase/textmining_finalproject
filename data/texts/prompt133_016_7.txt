The beautiful sunny day was again marred by the dark cloaked figure sulking in the background. 

Alice had taken to frequenting certain events and places after The Incident.  She had found that he particularly loathed children’s libraries and farmers markets. Luckily for her she had become adept at tuning out both him and the general chatter of small children. 

Today she had come to the street festival down near the beach. The day would include beautiful, warm weather with tiny powderpuff clouds decorating the jewel blue sky and little local stores selling whatever they could find. He would hate it. He hated places that were decidedly...undeadly. 

“Oh you have a great eye love! You want me to wrap it up?” Alice was shaken from her thoughts by the shriek of delight. 
She refocused her eyes on the tartan rubber ducky she must have been staring at, its little beaded black eyes stared back. 

“Um... no?” She chucked a quick glance over her shoulder to the cloaked figure haunting the edge of the festival. She had got to the point where should could read his emotions from a distance. Surprisingly it hadn’t taken long, for a person who’s face is expressionless naturally, he seemed to have adapted by becoming more physically expressive. Right now he was slouching past a line of excited children waiting for fairy floss, dragging his skeletal feet and leaning heavily on his bladed scythe. 

“Actually yeah sure. Wrap up the ducky. I think I know someone who might like it” 
The store owner beamed with delight. Reverently picking up the tartan ducky and clearing him of dust and dirt. 
Probably been around as long as me, Alice thought darkly. 

After an incident at a ball 2000 years ago, Alice had been punished by Death himself and she had taken her aristocratic training to carefully punish him back. 

This duck would be perfect.
