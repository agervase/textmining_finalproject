Jack glared at the woman that *should have* been cowering the back of the carseat. Instead, she sat there calmly, her back straight as she stared wordlessly out the window. It was unnerving, to say the least, and Jack couldn't help but stare into the rearview mirror at her. 

She had acted scared earlier, pleading with him to let her go, struggling against the ropes he'd tied around her wrist. But twenty minutes into their drive, she'd become exceedingly calm. 

Oh, some of them did do that. They became complacent in the face of death. But her calm was less the accepting type and more a confident type of calm. The kind that made him feel she actually wanted this. 

But that couldn't be possible, could it? 

He turned on the radio, his eyes leaving the road for a moment.

*Two were found dead inside their homes earlier tonight.*

All of a sudden, bright headlights came out of nowhere from the other side of the road, swerving into his lane. Instinctively, he panned the wheel towards the side, just barely registering the sound of police sirens as the car crashed into a tree at the side of the road, and his head crashed into the steering wheel.

His head buzzed, and a loud ringing began in his ears.

*There are no suspects in the case.*

"Help!" he finally heard the woman yell through the fog in his head. He shook it, but the ringing didn't go away. Something warm dripped down his head. 

Moments later, he felt himself being dragged out of the car as handcuffs were put on. He stared at the woman, who looked back at him calmly as he was put into the police car. She had said something before the police had come. He hadn't heard it completely clearly due to his head trauma. 

But it sounded like, "Thank you for the alibi."
