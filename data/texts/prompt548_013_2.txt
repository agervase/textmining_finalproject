"Yeh? And what about those gigantic, yellow orbs floating around Vaughn Haus Castle?"

Seydriq remained silent. He sat dejected in his chair while staring at the pages of his compendium. It appeared as though he was staring into nothingness.

"Or those strange yellow men they been seeing over by Rheinshearst., you know? Them things just ain't right. Something.... "Citrusy" about em if you ask me," chirped Johnny while giving the town butcher a coy glance. The butcher stifled a laugh and did his best to appear concerned.

Johnny noted his friend's reaction and decided to carry on.

"One thing's for sure, when life gives you this many lemons, there's sure as hell gonna be some lem-"

"ALRIGHT, OKAY ALRIGHT," interrupted Seydriq, finally standing up and addressing the townsfolk.

"Look, I'm sorry, this wasn't supposed to have happened. I must have misaligned the tuning coils while the Isocratic solution became homogenized. If the solution becomes homogenized, the miasmatic formulations could theoretically be thrown out of whack, causing a transposition of matter on this plane of reality. It's all because of the handwriting in this blasted compendium," explained Seydriq, while trying to ignore little Timothy Gaffer as he munched placidly on a raw lemon.

The town's folk stared blankly at the young mage.

Seydriq stared back, waiting for a response.

Johnny decided to voice an opinion.

"Look, Mr. Mage, we're not saying we ain't thankful for a whole load more of crop we can sell at the market. It's just that we ain't sure how safe it is with living Citrons walking about. Citrons is dangerous things, afterall."

"Yeh, Citrons," said the Tailor's wife worriedly. "They ain't natural."

"Yeh," said the Butcher. "Also, is it right to kill dem Citrins for the sake of makin' some lemonade? Citrins seem like people too."

"Yeh," said Johnny. "Come to think of it. We've now got a Citrin Refugee situation on our hands thanks to you. How's we supposed to feed and house this many o' the buggers if they come askin for a handout?"

The townsfolk began to stir into an uneasy din.

Seydriq thought to himself.

*Blast, if only the summoning ritual had proceeded successfully.*

"...the tall one, that's right, the one with the fancy dress..." chirped the townsfolk

*Lady Lemandra, my mistress, please grant your humble servant but a second chance.*

"...Bill, you're off ya rocker, what do you mean a lady's dress?"

*I will acquire the necessary reagents, I will re-conduct the formulations, the chromatography will succeed this time...*

"... that's it coming right now, see there past the fence. See!! Dem's are heels alright."

*I misread the translations in the Tartarous Generalis. it was the font, but now I understand, I can-*

**"NO NEED FOOL.",** said a voice in Seydriq's mind. A voice more terrifying and more powerful than even the mightiest of tempests.

"... say... what's wrong with the mage, he's collapsed."

....

"...He probably just needs some... zest," said Johnny.

The townsfolk broke into laughter.

The butcher decided to try.

"how about this one: Citrus... got real."

The laughter became a roar in the tavern. Johnny gave an acknowledging point to the butcher whilst wiping tears from his eyes.

"Wait, wait, I've got one" said Cassy, the milkmaid. "Seydriq is my main sq-"

&#x200B;

In an instant, the Tavern door shattered into a thousand splinters of wood. Before the townsfolk, stood a rotund lemon of otherworldly girth. The lemon was supported by two brown stalks, each fused into trendy high-heel shoes at the "feet." The lemon wore an intimidating black dress, with enormous spiked pauldrons. The lemon smiled a wicked smile.

&#x200B;

At long last, Lady Lemandra had returned to the world of men and women. A terror long exorcised, had returned. Lemandra stared at the terrified townsfolk. Her lemony lips curled into a wicked smile.

**"My supplicants... why do you wear such... "sour" expressions?"**
