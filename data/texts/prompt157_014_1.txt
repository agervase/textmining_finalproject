After getting home from work, Eric sighed as he prepared to eat and get ready for bed. But his attention was drawn to his phone when the screen suddenly lit up. Walking over, Eric noticed that the screen had a notification for Kingdom Hearts Union Cross. A sense of nostalgia briefly overtook him as he grabbed the phone and decided to see what was new in the game since he had reached the maximum level possible several months prior.

But once the game was booted up, Eric noticed that Daybreak Town was completely dark. Raising an eyebrow at this, he watched as Foreteller Ava exited a building when she noticed his avatar and a message popped up on the screen. “MoonlitPhantom, is that you? Have you really returned after being away for three years?” Eric wasn’t sure of how to react since he wasn’t expecting Ava to speak to him. He then looked confused when Ava said three years. 

“I’m not sure of what’s going on, but how can you be talking to me? But what do you mean by being away for three years when I really haven’t played in a couple months? And why is Daybreak Town so dark compared to when I saw it last?” To Eric, it almost looked like Ava was staring directly at him.

“I see that I have much to explain then. Follow me, and I will tell you everything I can.” And with that, Eric watched as his avatar was forced to follow Ava into a building. “Basically, the Heartless have overrun Daybreak Town. We need your help to take back Daybreak Town from the Heartless. As for your other question, time works differently compared to the real world.” Ira, Gula, Aced and Invi then stepped out of the shadows and Eric got the feeling they were looking at him as well.

Although he was confused, Eric sent a message nonetheless. “I still don’t know what all happened with the Heartless during my long absence, but where do we go from here?”
