The nurses told me I had been holding her for an hour, I blinked, it seemed like only seconds. They took her away in what would be called a joyous bustle had it not been so clinically professional. While they brought her to her bed, I walked myself to a bathroom mirror in an effort to act my age and wash up a bit.

I couldn't help myself, even now my hands were trembling with excitement, my heart pounding a rhythm it had not known for millennia.

And then I looked into the mirror, upon a face that I have known for longer than the concept of civilization, as cruelly unchanging as the harsh rays of the sun, a small tragedy had struck. A single white hair stood proud at the edge of my hairline, small, yet unmistakable for it's meaning, the beginning of the end.

A small jolt of unfamiliar pain from my eyes as the tears began to run, I try to keep some dignity for myself, but these are tears that cannot be stopped, created by instincts fundamental to life. I look at myself in the mirror as my face folds into an unfamiliar shape, tears streaming down cheeks, nose scrunched and leaking, yet underneath a smile so ferociously joyful, that I think myself mad.

In the privacy of the bathroom, quietly, so that my chest would not burst, I said, "We are going to grow old together!"

Not sure how I feel about this one, might have gone too slow and obfuscated with it, but that's also what I kinda like about it.

I also like the way it sounds better with the tenses shifting midway, feels more natural to me, like the shift to more active language to represent him finding clarity, but that might just be the signs of an unstable mind and irritating to everyone else.
