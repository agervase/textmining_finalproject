"And with that spin you get to choose a vowel for the board!" 



Mike looked towards the board. 6 words. 6 letters for the first word, 3 for the second, 3 for the third, 3, again, for the fourth, 2 for the 5th, and 9 for the sixth.

"I'll go with 'E', please." said Mike in a blissfully hopeful manner.

Six blocks lit up as the pretty assistant turned over the E's.

A realisation hit Mike. He knew the conundrum. 

*Not like this*, he thought to himself.

"So, Mike! Would you like to take a shot at answering the final conundrum? This is for $30,000, a brand new Tesla Model 3 and a SNES mini!"

*I'm going to die,* thought Mike, standing as if in stand-by mode at the podium. *I'm going to die if I answer this.*

"We need an answer, Mike!"

*That SNES mini is tempting, though. I forgot to pre-order it and now I'll probably have to buy one from eBay at a markup. And if I had a Tesla Model 3 I'd be so much better than everybody else, even if it was from the grave.*

"I'm going to answer the conundrum," said Mike to a rapture of applause.

A voice screamed from the audience, "MIKE! NO!" It was Mike's wife. She had also realised what the board was hiding. Pushing back the tears, she tried to make her way to the stage only for security to intervene.

"I'm sorry, Dianne," said Mike, stoically. "But it's the SNES Mini. You'll come to understand."

"I love you," shouted Dianne.

"And you'll love how much of a smug cunt you can be driving your new Tesla Model 3 around town," replied Mike. "You'll be so much better than everyone else."

With that, Mike cleared his throat and said, "The answer to the conundrum is 'Golden Eye for the N64 is overrated'."
