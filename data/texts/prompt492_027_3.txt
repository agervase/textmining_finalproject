My brother had some terrible powers, and he didn't realise how much they hurt.

He must have had a tantrum some time back, anger brewing and broiling until he released that pent up energy in some terrible catastrophe. The deaths were never immediate, but the scythe cannot reap the wheat until the seeds have matured.

I dipped in and out of this land. He dealt with the physical; I, the metaphysical. It was so much more abstract, purging the *concept* of a mortal, But if my brother extinguished the flames, I decided when the smoke would cease.

Sometimes it took years, decades. A loving grandmother in her family's memories. Centuries, for a great leader who shaped a nation. Once or twice, there were people whom I never touched, as the mortal realm forever reflected on them. They were never pleasant.

It was more than forgetting a man\- people can be immortalised in paintings, books, odysseys. But if none felt this person in their hearts... that could never truly be rekindled.

And here, in this war zone, some poor souls were forsaken when their entire families were massacred around them.

The genocide was sweeping relentlessly northward. Mother Fate tipped me that by the time aid workers were able to come this far south, many of these bodies would be decayed. She was unhappy with her youngest child's petulance, but what was done was done. She knew this more than all.

I found myself called to a fallow field, burnt black. There were still bodies left here. Some fresher than others, some returning to the soil.

And my brother was crouched over a figure.

"*YOU ARE LATE*". A Death joke, which he ignored. "*WE ARE BUSY*."

"**SEVEN BILLION HUMANS DO NOT ALLOW MUCH TIME FOR CONTEMPLATION**." His voice was steely. Icy wind blew with each consonant. "**BUT THIS ONE LIVED A BOLD LIFE, UNTIL THE PAIN WAS TOO MUCH.**"

I saw a figure, female, curled up in a ball. Her raggedy clothes could not hide how thin she was.

"*I AM NOT HERE FOR HER*," I began. "*STILL, SHE IS KNOWN.*"

"**HOW SO?**"

"*SHE* *IS KNOWN,*" I repeated. She had a brother in the city two hundred miles away, who hadn't been home in ten years. A pair of cousins whom she played with as a girl. An anxious childhood friend, north of the rebel assault. Not strong links, but enough to tie her to memory. Her candle still smouldered. But my brother didn't need to know that.

We sat in silent for a few moments. It was rare we passed each other; our work was relentless: pulling souls from around the world simultaneously, while our core selves dealt with matters of import. My brother tended to sulk after massacres, then vanish to a deathless corner of the world and work remotely for a year.

Then I felt my call.

Below the cadaver.

I waved a hand, and the cadaver's rags blew aside with a warm caress. In the void of her bosom lay a child. Newborn, filthy, but very much alive.

My brother spoke.

"**I... I REGRET IT.**"

He was looking at the child. It was a mottled grey, like ink, eyes closed in a squint, too weak to cry. Its physical death was not my domain, but even I could tell it wouldn't see sunrise.

But it was forgotten. The only soul who ever knew this baby in life was lying deceased atop of it. The community who knew she was bearing a child were annihilated a mile away. The family, friends who tied her concept to this realm never knew her joyous news.

The woman survived. Hid, perhaps. Injured. The soldier who struck her down must have also died or simply not seen her as a human any more, much less a pregnant one.

"*THE CHILD MUST COME WITH ME.*"

"**THE CHILD LIVES.**"

"*THE CHILD MUST COME WITH* ME," I repeated. My brother was always too emotional.

Grim rounded up to his height. "**THE CHILD SHOULD PASS BY ME FIRST**."

"*IT IS NOT MANDATORY*," I have no height, being a Reaper of ideas. "*THE CHILD COMES WITH ME, THEN YOU TAKE IT ALONE.*"

There was a small mewling noise. It was grasping for air. I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. But it was its time.

Death knew.

My brother reached down and picked up the naked child in his cloaked embrace. "**I'M TAKING THIS TO MOTHER. THIS CHILD IS NOT READY TO GO.**"

He was wrong, lying to himself. Denying nature was a dangerous thing to do, but considering his inevitability, he was often unpredictable. Mother would not yield. But perhaps she would give him a reprimand.

He took the child in his cloak and vanished. I felt my brother wanted me to chase him.

I would not join him in his embarrassment.

I would simply clean up after him, as ever.
