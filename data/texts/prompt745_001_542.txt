Dr. Alexei Mikhailov leaned back in his chair and rubbed his bleary eyes. It was finally done. The work he had dedicated the last 3 years of his life to was finally complete. All he had to do now was put a sample in a test tube and then find a good crowded spot, maybe JFK? No, someplace bigger, like Atlanta or maybe Beijing. Once he introduced the virus to a large enough crowd, especially in an international airport like Atlanta or Beijing, it would be too late for anyone to stop it. 

He didn't feel guilty about what he was planning. Intellectually, he knew he should. He was, after all, planning the murder of every single human being (or well, nearly all of them, the chances of at least a few people being immune to the virus was there). Still, he knew it was the right thing to do. Humanity was a cancer to the planet. They were destroying the environment and each other,  the world would be better off without them. Whenever he stopped to think of all the crime, rape, war, intolerance, and injustice humans visited on each other, he knew he was in the right.

He was shocked out of his reverie by a sudden crack behind him. The sound startled him so badly that he fell out of his chair. He turned around to see what was the matter, fearing some kind of equipment failure. That would be disastrous, his lab was isolated from any nearby human settlements; partly because he hated humans, partly to prevent an early release which would jeopardize his plans, and partly for secrecy's sake. If the virus got out here, Alexei would die but the rest of humanity would be fine.

However, what he saw made his jaw drop. It was a . . . creature, could it be extraterrestrial in origin? That was surely impossible? He certainly thought it was possible life could exist elsewhere but to have it show up in his lab? The creature was hard to describe, it didn't seem to be completely solid and it was constantly shifting. It was dark blue, or maybe black, yet had white pinpoints so it almost looked like it was full of stars, or covered in stars? Tentacle-like growths kept undulating in and out of the main mass. The being only hung there for a second before it began to silently approach.

Alexei wasn't sure what to do. He didn't have any weapons but could a weapon even harm such a creature and should he harm such a creature? It stopped, hovering mid-air right in front of him. Alexei was still wondering if he perhaps he was just hallucinating, or could someone be pulling some kind of prank, or was this some unknown government technology they had sent to stop him? A tentacle reached out and lightly touched the side of his head.

*"Please stop this,"* a voice said in his mind. The voice was androgynous in nature, soft, and had a strange echo.

"Stop what?" he said out loud although he felt foolish doing so. Could this being understand him, was speaking out loud even necessary, and besides, he was pretty sure he knew what it meant.

*"Humanity must not perish,"* the voice said.

Despite the absolutely amazing circumstances he was in, Alexei snorted. "Clearly, you don't know humanity then. Trust me, I'm doing the planet a favor and if you really are some kind of alien, I'm doing you a favor too. The universe will be better off without us."

*"No, that is not true. Humanity stands as a shining beacon of hope for the Universe. Indeed, the only reason we have not long ago invaded your planet is because we find the human spirit to be so noble and well, to be frank, adorable."*

Alexei was so thunderstruck by this that he was speechless for several moments. Then he replied, "I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't know who or what-"

*"You are ignorant, so we are trying to be gentle. Do not test our patience however."*

"Humans are evil. We're a cancer-", Alexei began.

*"Humans are imperfect, yes. However, despite your flaws and imperfections your kind always strive to be better and to come together. We see your mind, we know your thoughts. Yes, there is war; however, then there is peace. There is rape, yes, then there is punishment and justice. There is crime, then there are those who reach out to the criminals and the lost and try to lead them to a better path. This is not so where we come from. Your kind is at its best when you love those who are different from you, whether that difference be physical, social, or ideological."*

*"Our kind knows only war without end. We live under the rule of tyrants and our only laws are their passing whims. Any deed, no matter how despicable, is acceptable so long as you can use it get ahead. Humans have had so much trouble finding other life in the universe because so much of it has been destroyed. As such, we cannot allow you to destroy humanity. You amuse us, you entertain us, and you inspire us."*

Alexei shook his head, "No, this is preposterous!" he shouted. He made to get up, to get his sample and get out of the lab.

*"Very well,"* the voice said and it was no longer gentle, it was screeching now and Alexei felt his head begin to throb. *"Let us show you."* Alexei disappeared along with the being, his fellow humans never knew how close they had come to extinction.
