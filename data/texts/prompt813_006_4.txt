-What the...  
I reached for the floating message when strangely, my hand hit something hard in front of my face. It felt like some sort of hard plastic helmet, surrounding my head, but I couldn't feel it in any other way than touching it with my hands.  
I thought I had totally lost it, when I had the resolve to grab it and pull it slowly. Like a veal off my eyes, what I thought it was reality vanished giving way to a view of a reading room, modern-looking shelves full of books and some sort of white cartridges, as far as I dared to move my head.  
-This is fucked up- I thought when watching my body resting on a couch with all sorts of cables and gizmos sticking out, while at the same time I still felt my body standing up.  
A voice announced -Simulation ended abnormally, desynchronizing sensory drive- and I could feel a strange sensation of vertigo when I passed from feeling like standing up to reclined instantly, without ever passing any intermediate stage.  
-Hello? Anyone?- I begged totally disoriented. I waited for what it seemed an eternity, not dating to move a muscle, fearing I would fall into a black hole, or something worse. The door opening really startled me when a bearded, bespectacled man wearing a work coat entered the room.  
-Mr Sommers, sorry, Mr Delgado, how are you feeling? Have you nausea? Vertigo? Are you seeing undesirable image artifacts?- I was totally disoriented, that man looked like he knew me but it called me the wrong name at first. 
-Yeah, just disoriented, where am I? Who are you?
-I am Doctor Gates, your total Immersion VR medic.  
-Huh?  
-What are you suffering is the side effects of an abnormal desynchronizing. The implanted VR personality is still in your frontal cortex.  
A prick of terror hit me suddenly. Something, memories of other person made me understand I was about to cease to exist.  
-Yes, I am sorry Mr Delgado, you are just an artificial conscience that can't exist without computer assistance. In a normal desync we delete them in a human manner, but today is now the case.  
I started crying. God, felt so pathetic.  
-I told this because at least, you won't be alone. I hate when they just leave the consciousnesses alone and scared, slowly vanishing. Generally the clients also don't help, pushing for a quicker takeover.  
Sniffling through tears I managed to say -Thanks doc- He put his hand over mine, like a doctor watching an eutanasia patient going through, and said: -Everything will be okay.
