Here they were, looking around my apartment.

“This is your lair?”

“I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s a lair. I don’t really go anywhere else.”

WingMan flutters around, taking books out of bookcases and looking behind the pictures on the walls.

“You won’t find anything,” I say. “It’s really just an apartment.”“Where are all your costumes? Your assistant?” Hercules says.

“I don’t…have any of that.”

“You are a most unusual villain.”

On the TV, the game is still going on. Even with all these beings that could snap my neck in the blink of an eye, I wonder if it should be turned off. Sure enough, PyroGirl shuts it off, singing the remote in the process.

“We’ve gone too far letting you operate, Heartbeat.”

“I didn’t pick that name, again. You did.”

“We understand what it’s like to believe you are doing right. But what you’re doing is wrong.”

“How?”

They look flustered, just for a moment. Hercules’ stern, set face melts, just for a moment, into one of slack confusion.

“Because…”“It’s wrong of you to assume what you feel is right is what others feel is right.”

“Like how you guys have made the police a laughing stock, and taken the law into your own hands?”

IceMan roars in anger, and throws a gnarly icicle through the wall behind me.

“That’s nothing like what we do! What we do is necessary!”

“That’s what they all say.”

“It’s wrong of you to force others to do what you want and sacrifice their livelihoods just for your cause!”

“Just like how all of you take young, bright kids with futures and force them to be your sidekicks, abandoning those futures for your causes?”

“That’s nothing like what we do! They want to join our cause.”"That also sounds like what they all say!”

Hercules loses it, and slams the wall, opening a hole into the world outside. He grabs me, and pulls me to the edge. I am ten floors above the street.

“This must end! You don’t get to…you don’t get to-“

“Help? That’s all I ever wanted to do!”

“We don’t need your help!”

I don’t know what to say. For some reason, this hurts the most. I remember reading the comics, seeing them in moments like this, when they couldn’t help, when nothing they did worked, and somehow they still found a reason to believe. In themselves, in what they do. I look inside, and I can't find it in all the panic and fear.

Suddenly, I feel myself pulled inside, and laid down gently on the carpet.

Hercules wipes a tear from his eyes. “He’s for real, guys. Just give me a moment. God, your power is strong.”

Applause. They all start clapping, and crowd me. I don’t know what’s going on.

“Welcome to the team, man!”

“I knew you would pass.”

They’re all smiling, and it’s hard not to feel a sense of pride, especially with the shock of surviving. But deep down, I realize I don’t know if I believe in what they believe anymore. Perhaps it is time for a new breed of hero, one who doesn’t do it for show…
