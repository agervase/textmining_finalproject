I remember the sun, its warmth radiating deep into my coat. Laughter from children echoed across the park, and the chattering of squirrels could be heard from the nearby trees. It was peaceful, but for some reason, I was afraid. I was alone.

I tried to move, but I was weak. So, so weak. I looked around, but could only see the blades of grass in the field I was laying in. A large bird circled overhead, waiting for me to succumb to starvation or dehydration, whichever came first.

Suddenly, I hear a yell and see a figure running toward me. I whimper, and am lifted into the air by a pair of small, gentle hands. Her hair brushes by, as she squishes her face against mine. Another pair of hands grab me, and takes me into the shade, free from the hungry eyes of the predator from above. I am safe now, and close my eyes to rest, when I feel a nipple nudge at my snout. I desperately suckle, but once the milk satiated me, I immediately fall asleep.

I awake, a collar around my neck, laying on the stomach of the girl with small hands. I lick her nose, and she opens her eyes. From that moment, I know I no longer have to be afraid. The light flashes and I find myself somewhere else. It's cold, but there she is: her hands are bigger now, and she is holding my paw. I want to tell her...but lord knows she already knows. The doctor comes in and says it's time. I'm ready, but she isn't, so with the last bit of strength I can muster, I whimper. When she brings her face to mine to tell me goodbye, I lick her nose, just as before, and close my eyes for the last time.
