Trigger WARNING!  (scroll to bottom to see the trigger warning, spoiler)

It was in 3rd grade that the adults finally explained the names on our bodies, though by then we had asked every teenage sibling we knew and created our own little fantasies. One name your life blessing, the other the method of your removal. It was an exciting time for us, accusing our classmates of being evil murderers, and friendships falling apart over the names on our flesh. Never had we been more active than this year. The adults just shrugged and let it run its course as it had with every group of children before us. Bullying was stopped immediately, students transferred to other classes with different names whilst their bullies were put into therapy to curb the behavior early on. Honestly, life seemed to get better at that point. We no longer felt left out of all the name jokes that the adults seem to have.

I got bullied often though... During recess kids would shove me off the slide saying I took too long... I broke my arm a few times that year. I'd get tripped in the middle of P.E. and have to go to the nurse daily. In science class any experiments we did always ended up soaking the inside of my backpack on the way home. No matter how many transfers, and therapy sessions, and new schools. I was always the target. 

My mother was distraught. She considered homeschooling me, but had no time inbetween her three jobs to do so. She could barely manage to get job transfers the last time I had to move schools. So I'd grit my teeth and smile, telling her its ok I'll make it. Then back to the torture of daily life. This continued for years, and I bore it. It got so bad that the local government made an exception to all medical expenses for me since even their children were the cause of atleast some of my broken bones and ER visits. My constant limp was a dark reminder to the parents that their children were not the angels they wanted them to be no matter how hard they tried so they helped me out of guilt.

I could see it in their eyes, they were all at a loss. No matter where I went the parents knew me and would go quite. The kids would start whispering and making plans. 

For when I was born my mother named me after my father. A father I never got to see, not even in pictures. She held me and cherished me and handed me back to be washed. The nurse, then found my first tattoo. My own name scrawled in my father's dark and thick cursive. No other name had ever appeared on my skin since. At first I hated all the banter, being called a narcissist kind of wears on you, but when you realize that you are the only human beyond your own mother that loves you...things start to make a lot more sense. Everyone else is scrambling to figure out if their friends are their true loves, or their killers. Me? I'm not worried. Besides, who else but my mother would ever call their child Lucifer?

Atleast that's what the therapist said before I filled her with lead. Their tattoos can't save them from me. Not after finding my mother dead from a heart attack, devil cutouts lying all over my yard. Tiny footprints smooshing my mother's precious flowers. Who knows, maybe all their tattoos will say my name after this. I honestly don't care, because I finally understand why my only tattoo is my own name...
