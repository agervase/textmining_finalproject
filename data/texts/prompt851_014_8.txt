    I woke up in the same dark room i feel asleep in. They gave me one full day of rest before.... The show. Everyone here called it a show, as if it was some game show to them, i got to say i guess i was expecting more. I got ready, i was aloud one weapon that i used in life, so i got my main bug spray can, some heavy duty stuff but i was still worryed it would not be enugh. Once i picked it up i found myself already standing in the arena almost instantly after picking the can. I look over the croud full of demons and angels alike. I guess this is the one thing they can come together on. It was explained to me that it will be one wave of all my foes. I was in a massive arena like a modern day football feald but with black dirt. The croud grows louder before interrupted by an announcer.

"We have an exterminator with us today boys and girls!"

The croud begins to chant "Bug Show" over and over again.

"I can do this. I can do this." I thought to myself over and over again.

"Its just a bunch of bugs". My thought was interrupted by the announcer.

"Lets get this over with. 3". The croud starts to count along.

"2"

"1"

The croud noice dies as the massive door at the other end opens. At first i see nothing.

"Well of course i wont see anything from here its just a bunch of bugs" i thought.

The doors open wide. The croud stops stunned.

Tears fill my eyes.

"No no no... No" i didn't even think about it. The very thought made me sick.

I fell to my knees. "I will spend eternity in hell" i cryed to myself. As a little voice spoke out.

"Daddy? Is that you?"
