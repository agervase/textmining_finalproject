His skin was without flaw. His eyes neither revealed nor concealed any emotion. His lips neither offered or took away warmth from the world. He went about his work more perfectly than any machine, without a single excessive movement, an art perfected after eons of practice. His fingers flowed as if to shame the ocean current, extinguishing his soul and making it seem so natural, one could forget how unnatural the setting was. As soon as he finished, he moved on. I'd say that he took my breath away, but that would be insulting his work; he took nothing in excess, not a drop of blood nor a hair out of place. Such otherwordly perfection is what drove me to throw away what goals I had for this world. I knew nothing I could do could ever surpass him. Is it not natural, then, that I should desire to see such a spectacle again?

The second time I saw him, I thought myself prepared. The stage was set, the props prepared, and I was looking for him to walk in. I should have known better than to believe I understand the thoughts of an artist. His descent from the skies was unexpected, so I blunderingly missed his entrance. His landing was flawless, however, and, needless to say, so was his work. I think I can understand why people leave birdseed to see birds on their front yard. I imagine if they could only see him, perhaps I would not be the only standing here. 

Anyways, that's enough rambling from me. I freely admit to it all. To their grieving families, I just want to say, they have achieved a higher purpose than they ever did with you. You'll see. Now don't make me wait, hurry up with my sentence. I've waited too long. I can already see his face. His flawless skin, his piercing eyes. His dexterous hands and graceful feet. I only wish that his expressionless lips could bear just one smile, for my sake.
