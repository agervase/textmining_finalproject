I sighed. 

*This job was supposed to be an honor...*

The ancient, rusted locker creaks open, and I place my robe and my scythe inside. When I look down, I notice my black on black pinstriped suit had a newfound tear. The dragon-emblazoned buttons unceremoniously pop undone, and I toss my jacket onto my leather chair. The tear went down through my shirt as well, revealing the crisp, pristine bone ribs underneath. I undo my shirt and with the grace of a prince, I plop into my chair behind my desk. 

&#x200B;

*1534. Second best score in the millennia! And what does it get me, a fuckin' eternity of boredom. I swear if I ever catch that con Mr. Modera, I'll--*

&#x200B;

**BZZzzzt!**

&#x200B;

My thoughts were halted by the buzzer, and I look over. Orange light, returning customer. I sink back into my chair, and give a skeleton's grin. I press my desk's big purple button. 

&#x200B;

"Let him in Cherlene," I say, slicking back my dark greasy hair.

&#x200B;

"But, sir, you're not dressed..." my secretary trailed off over the intercom. "That'd be a 7-2"

&#x200B;

I glared at the button, not knowing where her camera was. Grumbling, I raise up and quickly don my business suit again before abruptly planting myself back into my chair, turning my back to the door. 

&#x200B;

"Let him in."

&#x200B;

The door swings open, and a gust of hot air enters the room. The familiar bright eyes of a young man light up my office. Always happy, you'd think he didn't even know he was dead. 

&#x200B;

"You grew a beard since last we met, Tom," I say, before swiveling around to face him. "Looks like time is catching up to you."

&#x200B;

"Oh I don't think so, Mr. Grayves," he said, inviting himself in and taking a seat in the customer chair. The chair that was meant to invalidate my victims. "I feel younger than ever."

&#x200B;

"Please Tom," I grinned, raising myself to tower over him. "We're friends, aren't we? Call me Markus." 

&#x200B;

"Alrighty Markus," he said looking up at me, unfazed by my gravitas. "What'cha got for me?" 

&#x200B;

I stride towards my filing cabinet, and pretend to shuffle around a bit. The slurping noises of the abyss calls out to both of us as my arm delves into the darkness. I pull out a silver canister. 

&#x200B;

"Only the best for you, my friend," I cry gleefully, rushing over to the mahogany desk, and placing the canister out in front of him. "Why don't you open it and see?"

&#x200B;

"Well hey alright!" he says, grabbing the cylinder, and cracking it open. A blue light shines on his face, and his eyes scan the document. He pauses, and looks at me quizzically. "I see."

&#x200B;

I feel a shift in the air, and my bones begin to tremor. "Is...is something wrong?" 

&#x200B;

His face is stone cold, and he raises himself from his chair. He turns his head to the door, and looks back at me.

&#x200B;

"No, Mr. Grayves. I must be off now," with a full 180, he stepped out the door. And just as quickly as he was here, he was gone. 

&#x200B;

I was dumbstruck, my mind racing, and yet blank all at once. 

&#x200B;

*I don't understand! That op was perfect for him! Danger! Luxury! Bravado! The most dangerous trip to the udnerworld there could be, ripe with opportunities! Why would he turn it down?! Why? Why was he so upset? Why?*

&#x200B;

*Why would he leave me?*
