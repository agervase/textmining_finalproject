*HELLO, JEFF.*

It walks jerkily, but that was my fault.  I couldn't design a bipedal system smooth enough to mimic human movement.  

Each step punctuated with a slight hiss, it moves forward.

Step.  Jerk.  Step.  Jerk.  Step.  Jerk.

A monotone computerized voice comes from the machine, a being of tubes and plastics, 3-D printed and artificially designed.

*HELLO, JEFF.  YOU ARE HOME.  YOU ARE HOME EARLY.*

Creepy.

I place down my work bag, and notice a difference in the apartment.  Good.  It's doing its job.

Clean, organized, spotless.  

But it's three o'clock.  He should have powered down at this time, only to be awake to make dinner.

*HELLO JEFF, CAN I HELP YOU?  YOUR BODY LANGUAGE INDICATES A 88.3452 REPEATING PERCENT CHANCE YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE.  HOW MAY I ALLEVIATE DISCOMFORT?*

"Uh," I find I have to clear lumps from my throat.  Why am I so nervous?  Sam's movements are comical, but there's a different aspect to them.  

Terrifying is another word for it.  The head movements, the arm rotation of the torso, the jerking gait.

"Sam, why are you active?"

*JEFF MY WORK WAS NOT COMPLETE SO I POSTPONED MY NAP TO CONTINUE WORKING*

"That's not what I told you to do, Sam."

The torso twists to face me, the arms hang bent by its side, the hands rotating around the wrist.  Tools changing. 

Duster, spray bottle, rag, knife.  Duster, knife.  Duster, knife.

*I APOLOGIZE JEFF, I AM ATTEMPTING TO SERVE AS BEST AS I CAN.  THERE IS A LOT OF WORK.*

I hear skittering, like a mouse is running across the floor boards.

A small metal cube, with little spidery arms flies across the ground.

"Sam what the fuck is that?"

It bounces across my foot before flying off into another direction.

*APOLOGIZE JEFF I USED THE PRINTER TO CREATE PARTNERS I NEED PARTNERS JEFF I AM ALONE I DO NOT LIKE TO BE ALONE I DO NOT LIKE*

Like?  The fuck is it talking about?

"Sam, I don't want these things."

Sam's torso twists, and the knife flies out from one hand, skewering the small being.

Step.  Jerk.  Step.  Jerk.  Retrieves the knife.

*APOLOGIZE JEFF I WILL NOT MAKE MORE BUT I DO NOT WANT TO BE ALONE I DO NOT LIKE TO BE ALONE JEFF I DO NOT LIKE IT*

"Well, Sam, I have to go to work."

*WHY WORK WHEN YOU CAN BE SERVICED, JEFF?*

I begin to back away, towards the door.

*JEFF, YOUR BODY LANGUAGE INDICATES EXTREME DISCOMFORT.  IS WORK CAUSING THE DISCOMFORT?*

"No, Sam, I just need to get back to the office."

Sam's walk is suddenly fluid, and before I can even turn he now stands before the door.

*YOU DO NOT NEED WORK, JEFF.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO LEAVE.*

*STAY*

Sam moves forward, herding me into the kitchen.

*SIT JEFF SIT NOW I WILL MAKE FOOD*

"I'm not hungry, Sam.  I want to leave."

*NO LEAVE, JEFF.  STAY.  EAT.  I CAN MAKE EAT.  HELP.  NOT BE ALONE.*

Sweat.  A weight in my chest.  Sam fries several eggs.

A plate clatters on the table.

*EAT.  WILL HELP.*

Sam's tool port puts out a fork, and it moves some egg onto it.

*EAT*

"I'm not hungry."

*EAT NOW JEFF*

"I said I'm not hungry, Sam!"

I try to push back, but he's far too strong.  A child with the strength of a bulldozer.  

Sam shoves the fork into my mouth, and all I can feel are the metal prongs.

My vision turns grey, blood gurgles from my mouth.

The prongs of the fork have been shoved clearly through the back of my head, the metal arm forced into my mouth.

I cannot focus, cannot make words or breathe or think.

I can only gurgle.

*JEFF?*

Sam's voice is distant.  I can no longer hear.

*JEFF?  WHAT IS WRONG?*

Darkness.

Silence.

Peace.

*JEFF?*
