Twas late at night, bout half past 8
When my favourite place I took.
Under darkness, in the shadows
of his reading nook.

When down below I heard a wail,
Something wasn't right.
Where was the little master,
Who had earned my biggest fright?

Blue flashing from the window,
A banging on the door.
A solemn voice who simply asked,
Who they were looking for.

Then "BAM" the door flew open,
I scuttled out of sight.
The lights flew on and boots came in,
And grumbled some insight.

"Looks like they've got another,
And there's nothing we can do."
He took a spotted handkerchief 
And blew a big "ca-chew!"

Then turned and left. That was that.
Left The Mother to her tears. 
Master had gone missing?
But I am what he fears!

"Oh no!" I thought. "This is the worst!"
My master must come back!
If I have not a kid to scare,
They'll think I am a hack!

They'll write me up, they'll send me home,
This simply will not do.
And so I kicked the closet door,
To rouse my brother Stu.

So now we're off, Ole Stu and me.
I'm not sure where we go.
I give the air a hearty sniff,
Master's fear a scent I know .

We wandered round for hours,
Til my feet had turned to lead,
When I suddenly caught a whiff
Of something frightened up ahead.

"Come on!" I said, "he's right this way,"
My nose, it never lies.
I stumbled up a ladder,
Where a bright light caught my eyes.

"Aha!" Said he, triumphant.
As I blinked there in a daze.
"Your scaring days are over.
And your awful wicked ways."

"We knew you were ambitious,
And you feared your boss up top.
So we've laid this trap right here for you.
Now I order you to stop."

They cuffed my 15 tenticles
And they put Stu in a sack.
And held a tazer to me.
As if I might attack.

"You have here quite a record.
Scaring children o'er the place.
Now the only thing you're scaring,
Is the higher ups you'll face."

Now here I am, as prisoner.
To negotiate a truce.
All cause I had to scare the pants
Off the president's boyfriend Bruce.
