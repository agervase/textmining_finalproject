When I got the tattoo, it was on an impulse really. 
Spring break. A little buzzed. In the moment. All my friends were getting them at the little seedy parlor by the beach. The artiest was even running group specials.

“Whatta ya want?” he asked.

It was literally the only thing that popped up. No thought. Nothing. I just said it. He did it.

I regretted it later, but it was done. A bar on the inside of my wrist with XP above it.

And I don’t really play video games either. Which was the weird part.

My friends suggested as I went through life I should fill in the bar, reflecting my life’s “experience points”.
I never did.

Until that night.

I was walking through a park very late (or early in the morning depending on perspective). I should have known better. The park had a rough reputation at night. I never saw him approach until it was too late. Then there he was with a gun in my face. He was obviously tweaking, meth’s bad around here. He took my money, my watch, and my phone. Then he ordered me off the path into the bushes. I heard him mutter “no witnesses”.

It was pure instinct after that. I wanted just to get away. We wrestled for the gun. It went off facing his head. 

He died instantly. I felt nauseous. I couldn’t breathe. Then it came. The euphoria. I thought I was going crazy. Maybe about to pass out. But I didn’t.

When the wave passed I felt....normal. No regret. No shame. No guilt. And no fear. I just wanted to leave. Didn’t even call anyone. Just walked off.

At home is when I noticed it. The tattoo filled in. Just a little. Maybe 1%.

Crazy as it sounds but I purposely started going to those areas. Areas that are dangerous and life cheap. I wanted to repeat what I was calling “the experiment”. Same thing every time. Same feelings.

And the bar fills in each time.

I’m getting really good at this now.

Yesterday I was reading on line about a convicted serial killer being put to death. But what caught my eye was his picture.

And that halfway filled in XP bar tattoo on his wrist.....
