Reporter: So congratulations on you're victory last year. What were you thinking going in to this last years games?

Me: Well I knew this last years competition would be tough but I had an idea in my mind of how i was going to do it. I had to go way over the top and I believe I did.

Reporter: I would say so going back to the Jurassic age and bringing a dinosaur forward was a new twist.  

Me: Like i said it had to be over the top. The biggest part was getting it knocked out and brought in. Getting it to hitler was the easy part.

Reporter: How so?

Me: Well I knew he was going to be at that air field at that time and on that date all i had to do was drop the T-Rex off at the right place at the right time. 

Reporter: I don't think they expected a T-Rex to come falling out of the Sky on a parachute with a rocket launcher strapped to its back playing flight of the Valkyries blaring over loud speakers and giant chainsaws strapped to its hands. Then commence to eating everything and everyone.

Me : Like I said I had to go over the top and that was the best way I could think of. I did not expect the guard to last as long as they did I figured they would run the second the Rex hit the ground I was not expecting to  have to blow up the  getaway cars. Of course seeing hitler in the corner when the Rex walked up was priceless he shit himself then got ate in one bite.

Reporter: That was priceless. So going on to this years events what do you have planned this year?

ME: Well I cant really say at the moment I'm already making preparations to top last year all I can say is this it will be epic.
