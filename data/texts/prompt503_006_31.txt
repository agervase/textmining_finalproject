There once were two people.

One named 顏毅(yan yi), from Taiwan and one named Бралька (Braylka), from Ukrane.
They met in Taiwan, Бралька was on vacation in Taiwan, and met 顏毅.
They met at a religious ceremony, they both were very religious, and shared the same goals in life.
They knew their own respective parents would approve of a marrige between them; of course their parents did, and the two got married shortly after.

After beeing married for a few years, and learning to see each-others' flaws, and work through them, something changed.
YanYi decided it was time to learn Ukranian, so that he could talk to  Braylka naturally, many hipsters have started doing it, and YanYi knew there couldn't be anything wrong with speaking naturally.

"It's the way it was meant to be, right?" he thought.

So he starts learning Ukranian, one word at a time, one grammar point at a time.
Language learning hasn't been practiced in a very long time, so he's suprised how old some of the resources are. He starts saying some things to Braylka once and a while in Ukranian. She thinks it's adorable!

"Awe! It's so sweet he's been learning my language" she though.

When he starts to get fluent, he goes back to his old texts to her, and starts to read in the original language. She seems oddly aggressive.

"Maybe there was a mistranslation somewhere?" he thought to himself.

As he read more and more, and listened to the recordings of their late night Skype chats, he noticed she uses much more vulgar language than he remembers. She seems to be non-apreeciative of his help...

"Strange..." YanYi though. "I always thought Braylka was sweet, not so harsh!"

One day, he talks to Braykla in Ukranian and decides to bring up the point that he's been learning for quite some time, and when he read their texts and listened to their old chats, he noticed she seems harsher than he remembers. He thought it was sorta funny, he doesn't mind some sass.

"Hey.... Sweatheart... " Braylka started "I... I've been using a special translation feature to try and hide my problems. I... I... " she stuttered "I do love you, but I was so affraid of offending you because I have a really bad habit of using mean, and hurtful language. I don't mean to, it's just a habit I picked up from my Dad"
Braylka started crying.

"I love you! I do, I was just scared that you wouldn't understand, that you'd think I was mean..."

"I love you too Braylka.
We can work on this together; I'll help you through this"

Brraylka, and YanYi cried together, and fell asleep.

As time went on they began to work on Braylka's cursing problem, and Braylka even learnt some Chinese for YanYi.
As they grew closer, there was no need for translators.
They could now truly say:
 "I love **you**",
"我愛**你**", and
"Я **тебе** люблю"
