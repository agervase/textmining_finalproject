"I think he's gone mad..."

"Shiiiit...he's lost it..."

The boys stare at Kevin from around the corner and quickly duck back, not wanting to be caught staring. But there was something really weird going on in the kitchen. Kevin was being really weird.

"What the fuck do we do? This is not normal behavior!" Liam hisses, taking a quick glance at what was going on in the other room and then back at Tyrone. "We need to do something."

"Do what? The guy is literally beating the shit out of mashed potato! Mashed potatoes! With his bare hands!" Tyrone stares at the opposite wall and shakes his head. "I'm out of here...the dudes possessed. I ain't got the time for this freaky-

"We're not going anywhere we gotta do something!"

"Do what?!"

They both take another look, slowly, and see that yes he is still in the same situation. Beating the shit out of the pile of slop sat on the table, without a plate or a bowl or anything. The scene is ludicrous.

"Just mash damn you! Damn you! Why won't you just...arghhhhhh!" Kevin screams at the food and transfers to beating it with both his fists as opposed to one.

"We can't help him!" Tyrone whispers loudly. "Ain't no one who can help a guy like that!"

"Tyrone come on-

"Baby..."

They both cease with their conversation and take a look in the kitchen to see who Kevin is talking to. They see that he has given up with the mash and is now slumped on the floor, leaning against the counter, talking into his cell phone.
"Baby...can you come here I..." he sighs and then sobs. "I was wondering if you could come feed me..." he pauses. "Mashed potato...yeah I know, I know..." he inhales deeply and then exhales in relief. "Thank you...I love you."

Tyrone leans back and begins walking away. "That is some weird shit..."

Liam takes another look at the scene before he too follows Tyrone down the corridor. He didn't really want to know...to be really honest.
