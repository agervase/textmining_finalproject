The two men were sitting opposite one another, one had a bourbon and the other a whiskey, but other than that they both looked very...nondescript. like those generic people out of anatomy books. their clothes, likewise, were standard cuts, muted colours, but perfectly tailored, silently betraying their inexpensive looks.

They were both sitting opposite one another, staring into their glasses, when one of them felt a hand on his shoulder, whirled around and was staring at a familiar face.

"Buddy! holy shit, what brought you here? I haven't seen you since the trenches!"

"Oh yeah, what was it? 1912? 1915? I'm so bad with years."

they'd met during mustering for WWI, and he'd seen him die when he was hit in the head while looking out of a trench.

"1917. how do you not remember your own death?"

"do you remember your deaths, John?"

"no, actually. sorry for snapping at you. how was it?"

"well, last thing I can remember is a very large pain in my forehead. after that, I wake up in a hospital and the war's been over for three years.

"It was hell getting out of there, by the way. one of the docs kept going on and on about a miracle, he wanted to keep me for study but I snuck out,

"tried to find you, but it's like you vanished into thin air, where did you go?"

"oh you know, here and there, lived in africa for a while, completely missed the second one, the usual"

"explains why I couldn't find you anywhere, I thought you'd go back to America or something"

"alright dude, let's get out of here. you can live with me and the others, can't leave my brother alone again. we all know what you'd do if you knew I am there to fix it."

And with that, the sitting man stood up, threw down his beverage, and they both walked out the door.
