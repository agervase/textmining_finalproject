The crowd bellowed with applause as Torrin, the oldest and last to approach the altar, received his sponsor. Thor seemed a fitting God as Torrin raised a hammer to rest on his shoulder. The applause slowly turned to a palpable silence as Orrik steadily pushed open both temple doors. It had been 14 years since he had set foot in his homeland. 14 lonesome years since he had been banished from the kingdom. The corner of his mouth lifted ever so slightly—they remembered him. 

News of his uncle’s competition had reached even the farthest corners of the globe, and he did not intend to miss this opportunity. The opportunity to right past wrongs. Orrik walked toward the altar with unwavering conviction. It was just as ornate as he had expected. Solid gold, standing two feet off the ground, with a circle of deep red candles burning low around it. Set into the altar were jewels of every kind, but a large ruby set on the front drew the most attention. 

Torrin stepped aside with a sneer, only a prince could enter the circle without dying. Not even the priests could get too close. The tension broke for a moment as Orrik stepped through the circle, and knelt at the altar. Not even the gods could deny him his birthright. Orrik had no weapon to present, no armor or shield to raise to the altar. So he ripped a strip of cloth from the rags he wore, stained with years of blood and dirt, and laid it down as his offering. Slowly, Orrik raised his head to speak. 

“If any god wishes to bless me in this competition I will accept, but I do not fight for you. For what I fight for is far more powerful than even you have to offer. I have been given nothing in this life and expect nothing as I kneel here today, but I promise this much, I will not lose.”

As Orrik stood to leave the circle, a quiet but firm whisper found its way through the temple’s great hall. 

“I will have you.”

The light from the candles went out, and the windows slowly went black as if overpowered by sheer darkness. Orrik found himself face to face with a slight, withered old man wrapped in black rags. No more words needed to be spoken as one long finger reached out and touched the heart of the exiled prince. Understanding dawned on Orriks face as memories of everyone he had lost replayed through his mind. Only this time, the memories were different. As each one died, this old man was there to carry the loved ones on to the next realm. Orrik had been chosen by death himself. The man drew his hand back, and departed with one final message—this gift works only on those who truly deserve to die, and comes with the ultimate price. 

———————————————————————————

Each prince rode into the arena upon magnificent war horses to applause and cheers from the crowd. Orrik was the last to enter, with no horse of his own and the king showing no mercy, he entered on foot. He scanned through the crowd as he walked, each person who met his gaze quickly averted their eyes. Finally, Orrik stopped in the center of the arena.

The king quieted his subjects and addressed the men in the arena. 

“There are many men here worthy of carrying the throne after I am gone. The only thing standing between you and eternal glory are the others standing before you. Kill or be killed.”

He lifted his hand into the air, ready to signal the start of the bloodshed. The audience stood on edge, waiting for it all to begin, waiting to see who would survive. Just before the king dropped his hand, Orrik turned to face him.

“You speak with such authority now uncle Aaros, it does not fit you. I still remember you as the timid, jealous man who did not even have the courage to kill my father himself. Instead you sent assassins in the night, they snuck into the royal chambers and slaughtered my entire family. It’s too bad my bed was empty when they came. I had nightmares that night, and slipped unheard into my father chamber to sleep under his bed. I laid there, stifling my screams and my tears, as your assassin stood over my mother—“Aaros sends his regards.” Well I’m not that little boy anymore, and those nightmares could never scare me after what I saw as I crawled out from under the bed. I am Orrik, son of Levos, and today I will shed no mans blood but yours. This is your day of reckoning.”

With that, Orrik reached out and extended one long finger toward the king. Everyone in attendance watched in slow motion as Aaros’s limp body tumbled over the balcony and down into the arena. Orrik turned before the body reached the dirt, and there was that old man in black rags. The two exchanged a smile as if they were old friends, and Orrik gladly took his hand.
