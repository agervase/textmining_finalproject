It had been seven months since the death of my cat Lily, seven months since my neighborhood found out I had the touch of death. It was an accident though, I have no idea how but we had been sleeping side by side and the next thing I know my hands burned. Out of the need for comfort I had touched my cat, simply wanting to stroke her fur but as I watched horrified her chest fell in breath but never rose again, her body quickly began to decay for she had been almost seventy five years old. My guess was I not only stopped her heart but sped up the process of decomposition.

Now seven months later my father had become a wealthy man, moment he realized what I could do his greed too the better of him and I was forced to place my hands on anyone paying him yet I never saw a dime. He fed me only enough to keep me alive, gave me nice clothes only when I was to kill, the love he held for me was gone. It didn't help that I killed my own mother at birth, guess even back then I held the power....yet...why did it not show until seven months ago...unless it's possible that since I was never touched by my father, I don't think he ever loved me.

Swinging my leg over the windowsill my mind reflects to one thing; why me, why was I chosen to become the Reaper, the angel of death as some call me. A question with no answers, a question I will forever search for those empty answers as I drop to the ground from a two story window and take off. I leave behind this letter; don't follow me, leave me to my solitude for the deaths I have been forced to give will forever haunt me, and as a ten year old child....I shouldn't feel like I've lived longer, pity this child...and leave me be.
