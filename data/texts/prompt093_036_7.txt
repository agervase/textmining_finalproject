I sighed. This wasn't my first time being summoned. It's usually one of six "demons" that I know. They play guessing games, as in I have to guess which one summoned me. The summoner waved their hand, saying something in a language I don't understand, and I was trapped in a pink cell. 

The pink was a dead giveaway. For those unaware, pink is the color of lust. This made it pretty easy to figure out it was either the incubus or the succubus. I touched the wall with my finger. I felt a slight shock, and withdrew my hand

"Hello, Inky."

I called the incubus "Inky" because his real name is about one-thousand letters long. 

"How do you ALWAYS know when it's me?"

"Because your sister is better at making these prisons than you. Plus, the scent."

I was referring to the succubus. The reason I called her better at summoning is because when I touch one of the walls she makes, it hurts. He waved his hand, putting me back in the original circle. 

"So, what do you want this time?"

'Demons' don't just summon at random. They always want something. 

"Well I uh....have a strange request."

I knew I was getting into something bad. His usual requests were expected from an incubus, but he always had something planned for his stranger ones.

"What do you need?"

"...A blood sample."

"What half brained scheme have you come up with this time?"

"It's for someone's birthday!"

Demons referred to the day the died and went to 'hell' as birthdays when around 'humans.'

"What's in it for me?"

"The usual price."

"I want double." 

"Fine."

He tore my head off and I died. Still, it was a pretty fun party, as I realized they were planning my murder and birthday on the same day.

Moral of the story? Damned if I know.
