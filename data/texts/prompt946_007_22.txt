What is this? How can this be? "too dangerous to be taught..." Is this some sort of sick joke? I know what I saw when I took the innate magic ability test at the university.  No one had ever seen null before. It's usually supposed to be from 0 to 100 from no magical abilities to that of immense magical talent. I didn't even get a 0. I don't understand what is going on anymore, but I must find out. I need to find out if it's true. Even with this unbelievable letter at least now I have a chance, a chance to learn magic. Something that I have dreamed of doing ever since I was a kid. "Okay I need to calm down and think, what should I do next?" My parents must know something. There must be a reason why they never let me study magic even though they are famous magicians and that I should have gotten their abilities from the family bloodline. "There must be a reason for this."

As I sat down and collected my thoughts and began to think about what I should do next. "Maybe the basement, that's where they keep all their spare magic tomes." They've never let me down there before but maybe I should take a look before they come back home from work. The thought spread like wildfire in my mind and I just couldn't keep calm anymore. "I have to find out, I must find out the truth. "

With each step that I took my body began shaking. "Maybe there is a chance for me after all." I reluctantly opened the door to the basement with the spare key hidden under the flower vase and walked in. "Let's start with something simple, something they use to flower the plants. What was it called again? Yes, here it is, *Water Stream."* I picked up a tome from the bookshelves along the back wall and recited the verse like how my mother always does when she water the plants everyday. *" O water spirit please grant me my wish, with my mana as offering, Water Stream."* I chanted excitedly hoping the letter was true, hoping that I could actually use magic, but nothing happen. "Not a single drop of water, so it was a joke after all." Slouching my shoulders as I slowly moved, running my fingers along the line of tomes." Why did they send this letter? Was it a mistake?" *Lightning Blast, Fireball, Minor Healing, Earth Shatter...* I moved slowly while looking at the wall of tomes but nothing really caught my eyes. "Huh, what is this?" What's with this tome? These symbols, it's unlike anything I've seen before. I slowly took out the tome and gazed silently at the four symbols carved on the cover of the tome. 降魔剑书. "I wonder what these symbols mean?" I slowly opened the tome and a tsunami of information engulfed my mind as I fell on my knees. "降魔剑书第一式，圣龙飞天." My consciousness began to fade away as a recited a phrase that made no sense to me, and then something flew past my field of view.  A creature flying through the ceiling destroying everything in its path creating a gigantic hole through the roof of the house. "Oh crap, I'm so screwed."
