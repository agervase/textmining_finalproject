The progress bar shot up like a rocket as the cat firmware began updating.
Fuzzy's tail, now plugged into my computer, swished quickly from side to side. It's clear he wasn't happy about this. I looked back at Fuzzy himself and saw him glaring back at me, silent yet angry purrs exiting his mouth.

I heard a high-pitched *bing!* from the computer and turned to see that a notification had popped up. "C.A.T was successfully upgraded to version 256.3! Please reconnect tail in order to complete the upgrade." the notification read, accompanied by an emoticon of a smiling cat.

I detached the tail from the USB port, grabbing it by the base. As I reached out to grab Fuzzy, he seemed to back off, whether it be in fear or anger. He let out a deep growl, looking straight at me with his narrowed, amber eyes.
"Come on. Gotta upgrade, kitty." I said to him. I knew he didn't understand. To him, I was probably just saying a bunch of cat words randomly.

Scooping him up with one hand, I moved the tail towards Fuzzy's USB port, took a deep breath and then plugged it in. Instantly, Fuzzy began making a loud electronic meow, as he eyes began shining a bright blue colour. He floated out of my hands, into the air and started spinning around like a dreidel, screaming as unknown forces tossed and turned him around the room.

I stepped back, grabbing the desk of my PC as the lights started to intensify and Fuzzy became a brownish-white blur. The cyan halation of his eyes glowed brightly across every wall of the room. 
And then, all of a sudden, everything went white. The only thing I could percieve was the infinite, snowy void that had appeared in front of me and Fuzzy's meow, which had risen in pitch so much it just sounded like a constant buzz.

Then, the whiteness began to fade. The familiar wreck that was my room slowly came into view. I rubbed my eyes and looked around. Where was Fuzzy?
That's when I heard him. A normal meow, like always. But it was one of THOSE meows. The annoying one cats do when they want something from you. If it was in English, it'd probably sound something like "Hey! Gimme food, will ya'?" or "Where's the litterbox at? I need ta' take a fat cat SHIT!"

I spun around and saw Fuzzy floating in the air, yowling at me. He was, for some reason beyond all comprehension, flying. What sort of update was this? I grabbed Fuzzy and dropped him back onto the floor, where he started to slowly float up again, still meowing like the spoilt little furball he was.
My office chair creaked as I sat down on it and I began to read the "Patch Notes" section of the notification.

**NEW FEATURES:**

* *Cats will now take flight whenever they need something from you, whether it be food, water or even just being let out! Their meow will also quickly increase in loudness if their request is not fulfilled.*

* *There is now a 1/10000 chance that the shit fairy will be hiding in your cat's turds. She will grant you one wish, and only one!*

**FIXES:**

* *The "Manx Tail" glitch has been fixed.*

* *Cats are now 20% less likely to avoid laser pointers.*

* *Toxoplasma Gondii is now only present on ill cats.*

I leaned back in my chair. At least Fuzzy would make it obvious he wanted something now. So I opened the door and led him downstairs, where all his things would be. He glided past me into the centre of the kitchen. His food tray was there, the litterbox and the backdoor exit. He was a stray, after all.

But something was wrong. I didn't know which one he wanted. And the meows were getting louder and louder. They were sounding more like screams now.
I ran to the fridge as Fuzzy glided over and began shrieking into my ear.
Upon pulling out the milk and shaking it, Fuzzy stopped meowing for a second, sniffed it and then resumed shrieking.

I was going to get very tired of this, very quickly.
