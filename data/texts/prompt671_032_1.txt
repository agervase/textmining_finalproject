"All I require are the words." The moonlight betrayed me for all I could make out were a pair of faint yellow dots. Immersed in the shadow of the corner I felt his gaze from my bunk. "Will... will it hurt?"  I mumbled unclear if he could make out the words."Do you want it to hurt?" It was then I felt the cool whisper of his words on the back of neck. My hairs cringed as I could feel my muscles tighten. I wanted to jump up, but I couldn't. Fear had paralyzed me. "No." I managed to slip out. 

"Do you deserve to suffer, as she did?" Still dressed in shadows he takes a seat in front of me. "I...don't...know..." I'm squealing now. Why did I choose to die here, alone? Perhaps I was being selfish; the thought of waking anyone seemed pointless. Nobody would attempt to rescue me, they'd cheer... oh how they'd cheer.

He leans forward. "Why tonight?" August 12th. The one year anniversary. Poetic in a sense; I needed to get ahold of myself. "It's as good as any, wouldn't you say?" I couldn't help but chuckle on the inside. A man about to face his death and still unable to face himself. I guess I had become numb to it all; the constant news reports, interviews, lawyer meetings, the amount of hate mail I was getting forced the prison to shut down all post. 

"You look to overshadow her memory? To take what little this world has left of her." His words actually managed to evoke a feeling. Cruel it would play out; one final encore. 

"I look to solidify my name." 

In that instant Death gave one fail swoop of his scythe, an in an instant he vanished. A man of his word I couldn't feel a thing. I stared at the shadows of my cell thinking about the little girl I killed. How my hands so easily crushed her neck; it's true what they say about seeing a person, knowing when they've left this world. Her eyes lost that sparkle. I took that away from her.
