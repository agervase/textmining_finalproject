I awoke to thunder, the sky outside my window so obscured by the storm that it was difficult to gauge the time. Clock by the nightstand said 8:15. Shit. Missed my alarm.

I rubbed my eyes, and jolted awake at what I saw in my periphery. My repeat value, which normally glowed as a soft, green zero was screaming at me: a bright, crimson 7212.

The day’s schedule ran through my head: work, dinner with Cas, and…that was it. Whenever I repeated, I knew to expect either something very good, or utter catastrophe. I ran scenarios through my head. Did I win the lottery? Even if, why would I want to repeat that day? Surely I would be eager to move forward and spend my fortune. Is Cas pregnant? We had been trying for a while, and while it would make me happier than anything, it’s the same as the lottery scenario: I’d be too eager to experience the future.

Perhaps something awful. I’ve occasionally used multiple same-day repeats as a sort of warning light so that I could brace for impact. It’s always been my policy to push through difficult times, though. We can’t spend eternity avoiding our problems.

The sky lit up and roared. Another option presented itself to me, and I shivered with the thought. Some people openly intend to repeat their last day alive, if they’re able. I always swore I wouldn’t trap myself in such purgatory, but who knows how the face of death could change my mind?

I turned to Cas and gently shook her awake. I couldn’t keep this from her. She rolled over and smiled. I loved how her eyes lit up every single morning. “Hey handsome,” she half-whispered. I smiled back.

Before I could speak, her face dropped. Every muscle in her body appeared to relax, and then tighten, as her eyes rolled back and she began to shake.

Later that day, the doctors would tell me there was nothing that could have prevented it. Arterial clots can be difficult to detect.

But I would do anything to see her smile again. One more day, no matter what.
