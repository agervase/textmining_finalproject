The cold wind tears at the remnants of my tattered robe, whistling through the back alleys of this decrepit neighborhood. I curl myself tighter together to protect the last vestiges of warmth. One of my undead, Brian  stands watch, for in this hellish wasteland one can never be too careful. As I begin to drift off to sleep I feel myself dragged into a vision, a prophecy, I see an ancient sage long dead to this world spreading a new hope to these deserted wastes. I do not know what this means nor do I care, information alone won't keep me fed. 

In the blink of an eye the cruel, blistering light of day awakes me. I head out, deeper into the abandoned city to find something, anything of value. My parched throught aches as I suck in the dry air, my eyes squint careful to take in everything. Up ahead a fenced in yard of sorts. One of the ancients burial grounds, good news for me. 

The sun has reached its zenith glaring down on the bleached land as I scrape the earth off an ancient burial box. Revealing the contents I find a body, well prezerved with a perfect afro. I prepare the ritual, the commune  with the dark god zeleste. It's getting harder and harder to complete the ritual but I get it done and by sunfall it is done. 

"Speak shade, what is your name" I command

"Well hi there I'm Bob, Bob Ross"  he replied.

He than began to tell me the wonders of the universe, the more time we spent together the more I realised that my life wasn't so bad, I began to appreciate the beauty in nature around me. 

Alas it was all too short, as you know you cannot summon an undead for an indefinite amount of time, when the time came his last words were to "pass on the knowledge I gave given to you" and that's what I'm going to do.
