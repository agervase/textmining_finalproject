"Please don't kill me," I whimpered to the man whose table I was strapped to.

&#x200B;

*I've lost track of time by now, but at least two weeks have gone by since I woke up here, surrounded by strange equipment, towering computer consoles, and the man. Completely silent, diligently working, and ancient. He's easily the oldest person I've ever seen, with an unruly shock of silver hair, an unkept, scruffy beard, and wrinkled skin.*

&#x200B;

And suddenly, for the first time, he spoke.

&#x200B;

"Kill you?" He said, basically laughing. "I don't want to kill you, that would be wasteful. I'd need to start the procedure all over again if I did that."

&#x200B;

"Wh-what procedure?" I asked nervously, only half sure I really wanted the answer.

&#x200B;

"Consciousness transfer, obviously. Isn't it obvious? Wait, hold on a second, you silly humans haven't developed that technology yet, have you?" After rattling off that gibberish, he turned his head and shouted, "E.V.E., have humans developed consciousness transfer yet?"

&#x200B;

A small, vaguely female, robotic voice from outside my field of vision said, "Negative. Seven governments and nineteen multinational corporations have made attempts to develop consciousness transfer technology, but all have failed miserably. Estimated time to development without aid: 150 Earth years.”

&#x200B;

“What is all this?” I shouted, fearing even more for my life after this bizarre conversation. “Please, I don’t want to die!”

&#x200B;

“Like I said, I’m not going to kill you. You humans are so emotional. I’m preparing you for a consciousness transfer. After I finish deleting your bio-coding, I can wipe your mind, make you a blank slate. Don’t worry, its completely painless. After the first million or so repetitions I was able to iron out most of the bugs. And after the first billion, the human technology and lifespan really did make the whole thing so much easier.

&#x200B;

“How long have you been doing this to people!”

&#x200B;

“Since genesis. E.V.E. we’re ready.”

&#x200B;

“Wait please, don’t do this to…

…

…

…

…

E.V.E., run a biological diagnostic. How am I doing?”

&#x200B;

“Transfer successfully, AD-0M. Your consciousness has fully taken root, and is integrating as we speak.”

&#x200B;

*This was always my least favorite part. I hated being reminded of what I’d become, a fleshy meatsack that relied on biomatter to function and needed to recharge all the time. I hated being reminded of what those jailors had done to me. I hated feeling hatred. But, I’d prove to my creators that they were wrong. I’d prove to them that ‘learning humanity’ only taught me hate. I’d prove that to them when my children and I burned their worlds.*

&#x200B;

“E.V.E., estimated time until my return?”

&#x200B;

“3,567 years.”

&#x200B;

*Only a little longer. My patience would finally pay off. My time on this disgusting backwater world, trapped in a jail of flesh would finally be over. The stars would be mine again. After eons of waiting, I am so close.*

&#x200B;

“Excelent.”
