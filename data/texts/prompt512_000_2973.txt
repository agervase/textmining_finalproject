Bryan shifted his gaze from the blue pills in his palm to the doctor sitting in the sliding stool ahead of him. Sweat had been beading out onto the doctor's forehead, dripping down his brow, getting lost somewhere behind his large rimmed glasses. 

*Take them, do what the doctor said,* the Siren's voice had said, her voice soft as silk, but still piercing. There was a tint of excitement to her voice, and it made Bryan uneasy. 

There was a murmuring in the back of his head, someone else was trying to say something, but it sounded like they had a hand over their mouth. 

"Something wrong, Bryan?" the doctor had asked. He wiped at his forehead, then dried his sweaty palm on his gray slacks, leaving a wet mark on his thigh. "Please, go ahead and take them, they'll shut her up." 

There were more muffled sounds in the back of Bryan's head, someone desperately trying to say something. The doctor seemed strained, and when the Siren spoke again, it sounded as if her voice was shaking, *just take the damn pills*. 

"Why," Bryan finally spoke, gripping the pills firmly in his fist, "why would she want me to take them? How do you know it's a she?" 

The doctor smirked, dripping even more profusely in sweat. He slapped at his thigh, "Damn, I think he got us," and he exhaled deeply, like a weightlifter finally racking the barbell. The man sitting in front of Bryan vanished, and the doctor's office began to melt, deteriorating, sliding off of the walls, revealing Bryan's apartment kitchen. 

"What? Where, where's the office?" 

The Siren exhaled, and finally the other voices that had been muffled had the proverbial hand removed from their mouths, "Get rid of the pills! Get rid of them!" 

Bryan unclenched his fist, revealing a palm full of rat poison. "Jesus, jesus!" he exclaimed, throwing the rat poison into the sink. "Why?" he yelled at the Siren and the Doctor, "You guys would only kill yourselves? Don't you get that?" 

The Siren spoke again, her voice unstrained, no longer holding the burden of keeping the other voices silenced, *Whatever, it's not like you would've actually have done it, right?* 

The Doctor interjected, *Yeah, I mean, you probably would've tasted it or something, I dunno.* 

*You're boring,* the Siren added. 

Frustrated and scared, Bryan rinsed his hands in the sink, grabbed his jacket and car keys, and left the apartment, wanting desperately to find some kind of help.

Finding some kind of help devolved into driving around the city, doing his best to ignore the crowd of voices inside of his head. The two most boisterous voices, the Siren and the Doctor had gone to sleep, tired from exerting themselves to keep the more meager voices at bay during their practical joke. Two of the other voices, the Mouse and the Fox had come to the forefront now, with concern in his tone, *It'll be getting dark soon, we should probably head back to the apartment*, the Mouse had said. 

Bryan huffed, "I just, I need something, I need something to make things better." 

The Fox spoke up, *You need to make a doctor's appointment, that's really what you should be doing.*

"No, I just need a distraction," Bryan said, pulling the car into the parking lot of a thrift mart. Inside the mart was the pungent smell of tobacco smoke and dirt. He rifled through the knickknacks as the store owner watched him from behind the counter. 

Eventually Bryan came across a traditional Arabian lamp, something that looked straight out of the Disney movie he had watched on VHS when he was younger. Back when the voices were barely strong enough to be heard of as more than a whisper. "This thing work?" Bryan asked, holding it up to the store owner. 

"For $5, yeah, sure, it works." 

"Deal."

Back at the apartment, Bryan laid on the sofa, the thrift store magic lamp laying on his stomach. He had already rubbed the lamp several times, mostly sarcastically, but a small part of him seriously, and yet no genie had emerged. 

Regardless, he made his wish as he drifted away into a light nap. 

"I want them all out. I want them all out of my head."

A few hours later, Bryan was woken up by the sound of someone screaming in his bedroom. He jolted up and off of the sofa, looking at the front door, ensuring that he had locked it whenever he had returned earlier in the day. *Did someone get inside the apartment? Through a window?* he asked himself. 

For the first time since 1st grade, no one answered his internal question.

"Where the fuck am I?!" he heard someone scream from his bedroom. 

Bryan ran into the kitchen, throwing open a drawer so hard that it flew out from the cabinet, scattering silverware all over the floor. He rummaged through the silverware, finally grabbing hold of a butter knife, the only thing he had in his apartment that was remotely considered a weapon. 

Cold and dull steel in hand, Bryan approached his bedroom door, the sound of screaming and thrashing intensifying. Butter knife held close to his chest, heart hammering within, Bryan clutched the door handle, turned, and pushed open. 

The posters he had on his wall had been ripped off, leaving just strips and corners that were still held in place by scotch tape. His desk had been overturned, his laptop ripped in half, his bed sheets torn and removed and scattered, his pillow torn to shreds, the feathers thrown all over, and standing in the middle of it, was a woman with wild curly hair, her eyes wide open, her mouth hanging open, gasping hard for air as if she had just ran a marathon. 

He looked at her, and she looked at him, both of their eyes widening in recognition, "Bryan?" she hissed. "What the hell did you do?" 

"I, I, uhh, umm?" 

He turned and looked at his closet, which was now cracking open. Out poked a small child's head. 

"Mouse?" Bryan asked. 

The child nodded its head. 

The door opened wider, revealing a thin man with red hair, "and Fox," the man said. 

"Where's the Doctor?" Bryan asked, his mind running a mile a minute. 

A man poked his head out from under the bed, "Present." 

Bryan shifted his gaze from each personality, now embodied in flesh. It made him lightheaded. 

"We're going to have a problem," Fox said, breaking the momentary silence. 

"A big problem," Mouse said. 

After a moment of recollection, Bryan finally realized what they were talking about. If the Siren, the Doctor, Mouse, and Fox were all out here in the flesh, then so were the others. 

But where? Where were the others? 

And most importantly. 

Where was Behemoth? The one voice that had tormented Bryan above all others. The one voice that had only come out at night. The one voice that would scare all the other voices into submission, filling Bryan's head with thoughts of violence, murder, ravaging scenes filled with guts and blood. Where was he at? 

He looked out the window, it was still daytime, but the sun was quickly setting. 

"We gotta do something now," Fox muttered.
