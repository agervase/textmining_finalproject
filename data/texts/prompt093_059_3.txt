There I stood surrounded by candles in a dark room. I blinked repeatedly as I looked around at my surroundings.  

"That's strange....I was just playing my Pokemon Yellow game while laying in bed and now..."  

Looking around the room further I found I wasn't alone. At the edge of my vision I noticed beings just on the outside of the candles. I squinted and tried looking closer at one to my left. It was...yellow....and had a grin on its face...Seconds later the being directly in front of me stepped forward.  

It was a man in a lab coat with grey hair. He had a scowl on his face.  

He quickly slammed his tome closed.  

"Welcome Chrono to the world of POKEMON!"  

Seconds later each of the beings stepped forward. With a few blinks, I started recognising each of them.  

"P...P...PIKABLOO!" I explained as a Pikachu stepped forward.  

"Squirty!" I explained as I saw the Blastoise step forward.  

Before I could get more out the man in the lab coat cleared his through and addressed me.  

"As I was saying welcome to the world of POKEMON!" he shouted. Seconds later he took a fighting stance in front of me. Pikabloo walked behind him and stuck his paw out in my direction and shouted, "PI-PIKACHU!"  

Instantly this man charged me with his fist raised high. In shock, I frantically ran towards the edge of the circle of flames. To my shock, Squirty blocked my path. As I tried to step around him he shot a spray of water at me from his right cannon knocking me back into the center. I looked back to the man attacking me who had stopped his charge and was staring at me with a look of confusion.  

"There is no running from a Pokemon battle!"  

With that, he squared off again. I glanced back at Pikabloo who had a grin on his face. He thrust his hand up into the air and yelled, "pika....CHOOOO!".  

As soon as the man heard these words he drew a knife.  

"Time to end this kid."
