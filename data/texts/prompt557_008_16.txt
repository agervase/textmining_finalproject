*From that day on, I knew what I was doing was a lie. A complete lie.*

"Not coming to dinner tonight, Jay?" Mata said as he put on his shoes, "Heard we are eating ribs tonight." Sickness coiled inside my stomach.

"I'll pass, a bit tired," I said, hiding myself under the blanket, attempting to find some sort of comfort. *All those people... To think I was the one doing this... What kind of a program is this? I want out.*

"Alright bud, good job today tho!" Mata smiled with a thumbs up. "We have gotten to spray lots of it today, can't wait for it to blossom." *If only he knew...*

About a couple of minutes later, silence echoed in the hall. I was finally alone. *This is my chance to talk to the director.*

I quickly wrote up a resignation letter, trying to think some sort of excuse that might quickly get me out of this hellhole.

"Come in," Director Apati said. The door creaked as I peeked inside, the military commander doing paperwork. "ID and state your purpose." He said without looking up.

"303661480 sir. And-" I took a deep breath and put the letter on the table. "I wish to resign."

He stopped midway, I felt my heart skipped a beat as he looked up at me with a serious look. I could feel him looking right through me.

"Mind if I ask why?"

"Um. Family back home is in a financial struggle, I wish to help them out."

"Despite getting paid more in the program than back at Rez?" He cocked an eyebrow, eyeing my suspiciously. *I messed up.* "Did you perhaps did something you shouldn't?"

"No sir. I have lots of siblings I need to take care of-" I stared at him, nervously trying to construct words off the top of my head until he finally held up his hands.

"Say no more son, I understand. There's a convoy that is heading back to command base, I'll let them know."

*Well that went unexpectedly well. Too well.*

The jeep roared through the night desert as all I could imagine were the dead that i I had burned. The moonlight shine above, offering a bit of comforting light.

"We're here." The officer said as he beckoned me to get off. I looked around, only to find sand dunes everywhere.

"What do you mean? There's nothing here-" I stopped immediately and stared at him. Sadness filled in his eyes. *And thats when I realized.*

He drew his gun slowly and pointed it at me. "No please, don't do it." I desperately said. *If I only had power. If I only knew beforehand. If I only could do something about it...*

I closed my eyes, waiting for death to come and that's when I heard a gunshot. **BANG.** I expected more pain, but perhaps I am already dead so I can't feel any.

But somehow I could still hear my heartbeat, thumping back and forth rapidly. I opened my eyes only to find the soldier had fallen on the ground, blood spilled everywhere as I slowly walked back, shocked and confused by what had happened.

The driver quickly got out of the car, pointing his gun at me. **BANG.** Seconds later, he dropped as well.

I looked around, trying to find my saviour. In the distance, I saw three figures slowly walking towards me. *This is bad. What if these are the enemies? Am I about to be captured?*

I heard another shot, this time to me. I feel myself getting more dizzy and hazy as I desperately try to hold onto the car for support. Then enemies got closer while I fell to the ground, unable to move with vision distorted.

I saw a figure standing above me, analyzing me.

"I see mercy and compassion in his eyes," A deep voice said, "I suspect he is being used."

"Why not just kill him?" Another voice said, cocking his gun. "We have no need for a pawn of the government."

"Quiet Wolf," The deep voice said disapprovingly, "We'll let the boss decide."

"Bring him," A feminine voice said in the distance, it was a voice of power and determination that automatically demands respect. 

Before finally falling unconscious, the last thing I heard from the "boss" was something that sounded like...

*"Let's show him what the world really look like."*
