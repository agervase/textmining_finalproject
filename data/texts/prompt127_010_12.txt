I still remember the screams.   "Demon!"   "Evil!"   "How dare you!?"   "Trickster!"

That was ten years ago, now.   I once lived among the rich elite, high in the sky, in the tops of the towers of New, New york.   What a naming scheme...    Knitting hats for the homeless is just a scam, you know.   Keeps us looking good in the cameras.   Until I handed a pristine white one over to the cameraman....   with my filthy black blood all over it.   

You see, white and black blood is just the 23rd century version of white and black _skin._   Though, instead of the "N-Word", we now have the "B-Word".   Blackbloods.  Doesn't come off the tongue as easy though, does it?  Of course, it all comes down to control.   people with light blood spend their lives being as painfully nice as they can to everyone around them, and dark bloods go into undercities.  Because who doesn't enjoy living in dank, flooded, 21st century cities where everything is halfway collapsed and the power works...   maybe occassionally?  

But, well, that ends tonight.   They thought they could ban me?  I'm one of them!  I'll SHOW them! They thought I'd bend right over and take it, but I had plenty of things ready for just so a situation.   Like money.  Weapons.  Bombs.   All hidden in an old warehouse down here in old york...   so, quietly, under the radar, outside of the view of everyone else, I've told everyone.   We're all working together, unlike you blasted money bloated elite.

"Sir, we're ready, the bombs are set and everyone has evacuated outside of blast radius" Came a voice as the dusty door to my small office opened.   A wicked grin spread across my face as I said, "Then, shall we show our excuse for a world government what it's like to live down here?  If we're lucky, we might even be able to keep the new city"

I walked outside, into the warehouse.  Inside, sloppily-thrown-together flying cars waited for me.  It was easy to steal a proper car from above, strip out the fancy crap, and weld it into an older car.   And, well, older humans knew what they were doing- this thing they call an expedition can hold an entire pulse bomb, and the hoverpads do give it quite a nice look.

Tonight, we start life over!  The right way!  Perhaps I am a sort of Demon, heh.
