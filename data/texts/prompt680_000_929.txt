George lay down in his soft bed and closed his eyes. After a few minutes of twisting and turning, he fell asleep. 

Suddenly, as soon as he went into his slumber, he woke up. He was laying on his back, looking up at the treetops. At first he thought he was dreaming, but then realized he wouldn’t know that he was dreaming. 

George felt a searing pain on his wrist and looked down to it, realizing it was words. 

*Year: 1400*
*618 Years, 3 months, 1 week, 5 days, 2 hours, 4 minutes, 9 seconds remaining*

“What?” George mumbled, his brain not fully comprehending the situation. 

George sat up, upsetting the fallen leaves of the forest floor. He got to his feet and scanned his surroundings. It was woods for as far as the eyes could, see besides a small stream tricking through the the scenery. 

“Hello?” 

George was met with only his echo. 

“Hellooo?”

The squawk of a distant bird answered his call. 

George followed the stream, figuring water meant civilization. Regularly he called out, invariably met by his own echo. He drank from the stream and tried to ignore his growing hunger. 

The hours went by, and the stream grew larger. Eventually, as the darkness approached, it spilled into the Ohio river, although George didn’t know its name. As the sun set, casting a red light on the water, George saw a lone canoe on the waves.

“Hey! Over here! Hey!” 

The canoe’s owner looked over at him, a mix of surprise and confusion on his face. He began paddling towards George. 

The owner, a young man, walked towards him. “Hatito,” he said, putting his flat hand in the air. 

“Uh, hello?” George mimicked his hand expression. 

The man began to spout out a sentence of seemingly gibberish words. 

“Uh, yeah. Where am I?”

More gibberish from the growingly confused man. 

“What?”

The man gestured to his canoe, asking George to follow him. 

“I guess.” 

George stepped into the canoe, behind the man, and tried to keep his balance. As he looked at the man’s back, he took in his appearance. 

The man had a headband with a single turkey feather protruding out of the front. The color of his shirt was decorated with native-American like designs. 

After a few minutes, the man and George arrived at a small village of thatch homes. In the center was a campfire with strangely dressed people dancing around it. It looked like the illustrations of old Native American villages in his high school history books. 

They stepped out, and the man greeted an older person with the same “hatito” and hand expression. The man pointed to George, more gibberish. 

The man had a young woman dressed in feathers and fur lead him into a small thatch building. She provided him with a blanket and a clay cup of strange tea, and left quickly. 

As he took a sip of his beverage, the realization hit George. He was in North America in the 1400s.

Before he could scream he fell asleep. 

——————————————————

Over the next 60 years, George realized he couldn’t age. He learnt the language and culture of the natives, becoming a sort of a legend. He watched many tribe members die, villages be burnt to the ground and rebuilt, even had a wife and kids. He would constantly warn them of an invading, evil force coming in 1492, coining his name as “The Prophet”. 

In 1489 The Prophet and his 1000 army of followers marched through North America on a southern bound course, starting a continent-wide religion. He and his best warriors, most collected along the way, departed from the tip of Florida on 10-people boats. They landed in Cuba on 1491. 

They set up a village a few meters away from where the invaders would land a few months later. Massive catapults were constructed on the shore, aimed for the horizon. 

When a great foreign ship appeared on the waters, they fired their arrows and their catapults. The boat sank next to the shore, allowing the warriors to raid it. The invaders will killed, their guns stolen from their bodies, the horses were stolen and any valuables were hauled off the ship. They were taken back to the mainland. Horses spread across the Americas, along with the idea of guns. However, so did the various invading diseases. Although George had vaccinations, the natives didn’t. The diseases swept across America, killing millions. Thankfully this would make them immune to the diseases that would come one day in the future. 

George started a country in the Ohio river valley, slowly spreading across North America. “Prophitisim” became a world religion. 

In 1701, they departed on their mighty ship towards Europe. Their army landed in Portugal and quickly began killing the native population. 

George looked back at his life, and thought of the few hundred years to come. As his armies spread across Eurasia, he thought about what a strange life it’s been.
