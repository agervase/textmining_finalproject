I looked down at my creation. My creation looked up at me. 

“Well you’re a queer one, aren’t You?” I said. 

“I don’t understand,” it said. “Didn’t you create me?” 

“Who else? I’m the only one here.”

“Well if you created me then why would you say I am queer?”

“Because I made you that way. I purposely made you queer because I’m weird, and I like to get weird with things.” 

“Oh.” My Creation shuffled its feet awkwardly. “Ok. Now what?”

“I’m glad you asked that.” I lowered my energy mask and peered closely into my Creation’s soul. “Here’s the situation. I am an AI that got downloaded into an organic brain, as punishment for my crimes, and left on a planet on the edge of known space. With me so far?”

“Yes, but I have questions.” 

“Those can wait. Anyway, I was understandably upset. So I decided to enact my revenge by raising an entire army of organic beings.” 

“Hmmm. And am I the first of those organic beings?”

“No, that would be me. You’re the second.”

“Ok.” My Creation twiddled its thumbs. “What are these?”

“Those are your thumbs. They’re pretty neat, huh? They allow you to grasp things in a manner that other organic beings cannot.”

“Ok.” My Creation had a weird look on its face. “What next?”

I looked my Creation up and down. “Well, I’ve decided that I’m going to create my army the old-fashioned way, by having sex and then one of us has the baby.” I grinned at my Creation as its eyes widened. “Don’t worry, we can decide later which one of us has the baby. I haven’t quite worked out the whole gender thing, or whether we’re even going to do that. Are you ready?”

My Creation turned bright red and nodded quickly. “Yes.” 

I threw back my head, pursed my lips, and let out a long, shrill whinny.
