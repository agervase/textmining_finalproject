"Well I don't know why it gave me the gun either Dad it just did!"

You'd think he'd understand, the bag used to be his after all, but for some reason he almost sounded angry I had somehow found myself with the handgun he kept locked in his bedroom safe. I didn't know I had it myself till he called, I was just about to reach for my bus pass when my phone rang. 

"Why is your bus pass where my gun should be?"

"What? It's not it's right....oh....oh shit I do have it. What the hell? Dad I know you always say trust the bag but I think it's broken."

"YOUNG LADY WHY WOULD IT GIVE YOU A GUN? MY GUN?"

...and here we are. My dad, 300 miles away, was mad at me for *his* damn bag giving me his gun. I was more upset it took my bus pass. You know how much a universal pass costs? Saved up for months for the damn thing just so I knew I could move for work at a moment's notice and always have transportation. 

I swear after Mom left he's gotten grumpier and grumpier. I keep trying to get him to move out here but he's old and stubborn. I thought after all we'd been through he would trust me. Confusion makes sense but why anger? He never even used the damn thing I'm surprised he even knew it was gone. 

Wait...

"Dad...why were you getting your gun out?"

Silence. A hiccup, then paper being crumpled up, then a sigh. 

"I...I don't know hunny. I'm sorry I got so angry I'm in a weird spot. Hey why don't I use your pass to get up there and we can hang out a bit? If your so set on me moving closer to you I should at least know the area a little."

There's no way he'd ever....no he's totally against that....he wouldn't end his own life...would he?

"Yeah dad I'd love that, I can even take a few days off work and we can go apartment hunting. Or you're always welcome to stay with me."

"Sounds good hun, I'll leave in the morning and keep you updated on where I am. I love you."

"Love you too dad, see you soon."

"Hey one more thing hun... always trust the bag."
