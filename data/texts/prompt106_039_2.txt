-So, how's your job going?

A teenage couple was going along the street, holding hands and happily chatting. She was an ordinary schoolgirl, uniform and all. He stood out a bit more, but not too much.

-Eighteen today, plus three of yours. We're slightly under schedule, but you did good. 

-Just three? Buu. Couldn't it at least be a family? 

Her head drooped in disappointment. A TV in the store they passed showed a burning truck crashed on a highway, with a subtitle "... 2 dead, 1 in critical condition...", reminding her of the fluke. The plan was perfect- get a part-time job at a gas station and poison a truck driver's coffee- yet the death toll wasn't quite as big as she'd like for this amount of setup.

-D-don't worry, Saki, I loved it! Even if I was allowed to do such things, I'd never think of something as inventive.

He still remembered that scene two years ago. A schoolgirl with half a boxcutter in her hand, the other half embedded in her classmate's throat. 

-I love you! 

She didn't seem excited about the kill, neither did she freak out, in fact she didn't care about the corpse in front of her in the slightest, to her it was just means of summoning *him*. 

-I love you! 

She didn't know the Death was here yet- or, rather, *a* Death, as he was one of thousands. She just chanted her mantra into warm evening air.

-I love you!

-I'm here. 

She turned around, and the shine in her eyes multiplied tenfold. In front of her stood a lanky and worryingly pale boy in a black hoodie. Eventhough his face was in hood's shadow, his handsomeness was undeniable. 

-You actually came! You're so cool, you know it? I'm Saki, by the way, what's your na...

-Wait a bit, I'll deal with important things first. You can look if you want. 

And look she did, as he took a sickle out of his messenger bag and did some things invisible to a human eye over her former friend's body.

-So, you're Saki, right? And you did this for me? 

-Yes!

-Why? 

-Because you are the best! 

-So, I assume you've seen me before.

-Yep.

To this day he doesn't know where she saw him first. He never asked, simply out of politeness. 

-Hmm... This is the first time someone does something for me. Feels nice. I think I'll give this "love" thing a try then.

They started hanging out. She didn't have to kill to see him, but she still did. She felt obliged to help him with his work.

You see, each Death gets a bonus based on souls they harvested per month, and the easiest way to be on site before anyone else is to be there as it happens. Quite obviously, killing is the worst crime a Death can commit, including forcing a mortal to do it, but Saki technically does so on her own accord. 

Her first attempts at helping him were as clumsy as that broken boxcutter incident she barely got away with, but with time she got a lot better. She found interest in chemistry, particularly poisons and explosives, adding entertainment value to him as most of her murders were unique and very elaborate.

-Hey, wanna get a cocktail? At my expense!

Saki opened her school bag and showed him a bottle of vodka.

-Bloody Mary again, huh? I'm in. I guess since you're drinking it too you'll be doing it like in the good ol' days, no nasty stuff?

She giggled to a distinct crackle of a boxcutter, and the couple turned into a back alley to get some tomato juice for their treat.

My first post in WP is late and I'm a bit rusty with writing, but I liked the premise way too much to miss on it. It ended up kinda Durarara-like.
