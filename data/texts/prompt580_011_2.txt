He may have been a mustache sporting weirdo whose catchphrase has always been 

“Don’t let your parents know about this “ 
 But he always did seem like the sparkle in his eye came from something other than a real medical lack of sleep..

When he committed crimes , he wasn’t in any way guilty , on a self moral level. He never got caught , & never worried about the repercussions of what he did..

“ Man shouldn’t be bound by the laws of man , And man Sure as Day shouldn’t be bound by the laws of the universe either “ 

Those were his last words before he gave me a big wink , stepped into his “ office “ which was really just a ragged up bathroom with a coffee pot always brewing ..

It didn’t take me long to realize he was about to be doing something other worldly .. it was all in that wink ..

His eyes always had a glow , it made all the waitresses & lady folk ( and often even straight shooting men ) tear up and be at a loss of words when talking to him ..

He had this way with people , as if .. he wasn’t one., 

He always lived in this way , in our normal sized house , where his way of day to day was .. different ..    

He wasn’t disconnected from the world , he was adding his flavor to the stew..   explaining him would be like trying to write a book about a 7th sense humans secretly have - it’s possible but letting you witness that 7th sense still wouldn’t do it justice ..

My memories of my uncle fade day to day and his artifacts remain my only closure .,

The more I go through his finding , the more I realize he wasn’t the inventor I thought he was , he was a discoverer of sorts , if this world can even still produce new discoveries ..

That bathroom , oh that bathroom .. had I let someone use that bathroom that was a guest , and that coffee pot was running , well .. that guest would be in for the time of their life
