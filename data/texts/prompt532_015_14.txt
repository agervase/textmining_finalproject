Most people go somewhere after 400. After 500 you start to feel like a alien. Once you hit 600 you don't really know anyone anymore. You have to start over. 

I never had the courage to end it. Or perhaps I would have had, but I always find a reason to stay. A new technology. A new person to brighten up my life. A mystery to solve. And sometimes the calm and soothing pattering of rain in the forest. I've seen most of it. I've experienced enough to be thankful and content. Nowdays I have to go looking if I want to find something new.

The difference between me and others is that I don't want something new. Everyone else seem to be looking for something. They can't stay put. They have to keep moving, looking for something better, something bigger and more exciting. Always longing for what is new, or regretting what they gave up in the past. I don't. I am content. I am content where I am right now, and I am content in moving across the world and settling in there. Sometimes I grow weary of others. They don't understand. They don't have the perspective I have. They are children in some ways. Always running around, never sitting still. It's a shame.

"How old are you?" A voice interrupts my thoughts and I look to the side at Hannah. She is beautiful. Others might disagree. Her face is too round and her eyes to close. But her odd looks only add to her beauty. And she is calm and content. Like me.

"In 300 years this is the first time you've asked that question." I say surprised. We've been companions for a long time. Hannah was only 35 when I first met her, but she had a way about her. A calm an patient curiosity.

"I knew you were old when we met, but it is rude to pry so I kept my tongue. But now I take the liberty to be rude as I have waited long enough. So how old are you?" She asks. Her face shows a few wrinkles, but not many. I know how I look, grey hair and beard (I can barely remember any other colour), more wrinkles than her. Yet still I've looked the same for more than half my life... Far longer than half my life.

"Do you want to know, if knowing means you will be aware of a crime." I ask her softly and her eyes stay on me as she sit in silence.

"It's bad form living past 5. And at 6 you must have been hounded by your family." She say softly. She understands the danger of what I'm telling her. Nobody wants to life that long past 500. And it is illegal to live past 1000. Of course that was only implemented a few hundred years earlier, something about the psychological effects of living so long.

"They have all forgotten me by now. We barely have any genes in common anymore." I tell her as I lean back in my chair. The sun warms me softly.

"So..." Hannah asks and I open my eyes just a slit.

"So?" I ask, daring her to finish her question.

"So... how old?" She asks.

"... It has been hard keeping track these last hundred years... But I have a fairly good estimate... If you are certain you really want to know." I warm her. Hannah considers it for a good minute or so. She is so thoughtful and careful. Never rushing into anything.

"Tell me." She says firmly.

"Onethousand-eighthundred-seventyone." I tell her. And Hannah looks at me with wide eyes and nods slowly.

"You've been around since the beginning then." She whispers. "How have you not gone insane yet, like the others?" A hint of awe and almost fear seeps into her tone.

"The beginning is relative. It is true, I was in the first generation to receive the gift. As for the second question... I believe I have." I tell her honestly and Hannah frown. She looks genuinely worried now. A rare sight on her round face.

After several minutes she finally dares ask the question. "What do you mean?"

"About a thousand years ago..." I begin and then hesitate. I glance at Hannah and make up my mind. I have lived long enough and care little if I live or not. Telling her is worth the risk. Especially if the price would finally be a companion. A true companion.

"I did something rather foolish..." I tell her, keeping a close eye on her expression, watching and waiting for her reaction. "You see... I was bored and alone, and after so long it's easy to start feeling like a God. And I wanted to try something different. So I started a war." I tell her and Hannah's face turn into a mask of surprise as her mouth forms an O.

"The Great Wars..." She whispers. "You were the Conquerer! But you were said to have died in the Alta incursion."

"I escaped. And once I no longer held that power I gained some perspective. I saw what I had done and where I had gone wrong... I saw what a fool I had been... But I had to look forward. I had to start anew. Why do you think all pictures of me disappeared from history? It took almost 200 years, but finally I am forgotten and can be reborn." I explain. I am honest and forward. If Hannah would be my eternal companion then I can hold no secrets from her. Not even this.

"..." Hannah is silent, deep in thought. She says nothing and asks nothing more. We sit like that for several long hours, until the sun starts to set.

"Will you join me?" I finally ask as the midwinter-summer starts to fade and snow starts to fall once again.

"You would try again? Wouldn't you?" She asks and this time it is I who am surprised. I did not think she would be so perceptive.

"Yes. I have learned from my faults. This time I will succeed and I will unity the whole of Earth under one rule, under one leading firm hand. These children need a direction. They need a parent, or in this case, a ruler. Or rulers, if you would join me." I tell her. Hannah closes her eyes.

Minutes pass.

"I would. But this time we cannot fail. All must be under one rule or it will all be for naught. A price must be paid, but it should only be paid once." She says.

The decision is made.

I have found my eternal companion.

Together we will rule the world. 

Together we will be Gods.

Together we will be immortal.
