The last thing I remember before waking up was a bright flash of light, and a searing pain all across my body. I was expecting to feel more of the same once I turned from my slumber, but no, I felt comfort and joy. 

Was this Heaven? I was never personally religious, so me being there would be a surprise. My vision was quite blurry, not being able to see any further than arms reach. Staring downwards appeared to be a young woman, no older than 35, she seemed to have foregone a great deal of stress. I tried to call out to ask what was going on, but all that came out was a feeble cry. I managed to pull up an arm within my view. I froze in horror, I was a child again. Yet my decades of knowledge still stood in my brain. I started to cry, unsure as to what good God would curse someone to relive their childhood. A nurse pulled back the curtain, and entered the room.

"What will you name him, Dorothy?"

Dorothy sighed, she seemed uncertain as to what to say.

"It took a lot of consideration, but I will let him choose his own name, when the time comes. But for now, I will call him Fenix."

Many years went by, still the lingering thoughts of my previous life tormented my thoughts. The crawl of which my current life was, frankly would never be worth remembering. I had tried to write, but all that came out was chicken scratch. I had full grasp of what was happening in on television news stations, and I could fully understand what my parents were thinking. All the time I spent, wondering what went wrong, and how I had gotten here had faded. What was remaining of me with all my doubts gone was my full power and talent. I had learned to accept my mistakes, and to let go of who I was once.

So when my 5th birthday came around, I finally told her.

"I wish to go by the name, Talandar."
