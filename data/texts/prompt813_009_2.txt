*"Hey, Jon! It's been a while, huh?"*

&nbsp;

A lanky figure in a black suit approaches me, right hand extended, immaculately polished oxblood Oxfords clicking against the parquet. He started his advance way in advance and I had to deliberate whether to assist in closing the distance for a good two seconds. 


&nbsp;


I didn't. I just stayed put. 

&nbsp;

*"Yeah..."*

&nbsp;

Our hands lock. He holds it for longer than I like.

&nbsp;

*"Man... I think the last time we spoke was... Janet's wedding? Three years back?"*

&nbsp;

He said, as he flips the handshake into a fist grip and pats the back of my hand with his left twice before letting go. 

&nbsp;

*"Mm.”*

&nbsp;

I reclaim my right hand with my left and inspected the damage. I could feel the pulse in my thumb, the supple flesh of my palm under smooth skin. The slight hint of white crescents cracking a smile from the pink.

&nbsp;

*“Oh! Uhm… It’s a really beautiful morning innit?”*

&nbsp;

*“Mm… I guess”*

&nbsp;

My arm falls to my side. My fingers brush against the polyester fabric of my trousers. I never liked polyester fabrics. They always felt plastic-y and fake and felt stifling. But non-synths have been virtually unattainable for proles for around 90 years now, the only ones in circulation are heirlooms.

&nbsp;


*“I… I’m really sorry, Jon. You know I’m not good at this talking to people thing”*

&nbsp;

*“Nah. I know. Forget about it.”*

&nbsp;

*“You wanna… Hang with the rest of the guys for a bit? Relive a bit of our youth? I think it’ll do you some-”*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


*“I’m FINE. Fucking- Stupid thing”*


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

I bring my hand up to my face and flip the visor up. I could still feel the ghost of Chris’s handshake against my hand. I look at it, skin barely hanging off the bone, knuckle poking through the cracked vellum; like tent posts straining under a grotesque fabric.  


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

**Thank you for your acknowledgement. It’s a safety precaution I have been programmed to take, User Jon.**


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

I blink hard and frown angrily at the sudden change in lighting. The smell was overwhelming. The miasma of sickeningly sweet decaying biological matter and general musk singed my sinuses. 

&nbsp;


I notice a dampness sticking to my eyelashes, tracing lines on my face.

&nbsp;


A dim, musty room came into focus. As my senses slowly trudge back into this world, I saw the decaying wood of the walls I erected around me, the mould-ravaged high-calorie 50% RDI wafers littered across the coffee table whose chrome legs have turned the same colour as the reddish-brown dirt ground. I saw the afternoon sun stab through the moth-made gashes in the curtain, carrying in its wake, the cacophony of screeching birdsong, and setting blotchy bits of the room ablaze. 

&nbsp;


I try my legs to see if they’re still there and ended up shifting an empty glass bottle which clinked against what sounded like 20 others. I drop my gaze down to my feet, past my outstretched leg, and it fell upon innumerable empty nu-bourbon bottles obscuring the ground.

&nbsp;


I’m sure AB-InBev must be paying the WHO a whole lot of money to keep this on the market because there is no way this 87% ABV drain water-coloured liquid that tastes like it was flavoured with gunpowder shouldn’t be illegal.

&nbsp;


A small breeze slips in through the hole in the wall, displacing the curtains. The light shifts and dances like the world was a really fucking dismal kaleidoscope. The sunlight catches something reflective on the coffee table and my attention is momentarily arrested. 

&nbsp;


It’s the foil cap of a bottle of VR accelerant. The crystalline liquid inside, so clear that you wouldn’t be able to tell there was anything in the bottle but for the slightest hint of a rainbow if the light catches it in the right way. And the light did catch it in the right way. “Realer than Real”, the label touts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



The first time we ever met was at a café. I was a student at the time. So was she. It was the exam period and the place was packed. I was sitting alone at a table in the corner. She came over and shyly asked if she could join my table. I remember catching her eyes and momentarily forgetting how to answer in the positive. We realised that we were both Literature students studying the same texts and started discussing them. I asked her out for dinner that night. 

&nbsp;


We met to study every day after.

&nbsp;

I remember sitting, waves lapping at my feet, at the beach, staring at the stars, trying to help each other spot the ones that fell so we could double our chances of having our wishes granted.

&nbsp;

I remember the first moment I saw her in the wedding dress.

&nbsp;

I remember we wanted to throw a joint party with both our friends around.

&nbsp;

I remember I promised her that I was fine.

&nbsp;


I remember she was seated beside me in the car, giggling. Drunk from either the alcohol or my company. Or both.

&nbsp;


I remember reaching over to tickle her

&nbsp;


I remember her returning the assault

&nbsp;


I remember losing my focus for a moment or two.

&nbsp;


I remember…

&nbsp;


I remember Chris shaking my hand at the funeral.

&nbsp;


I remember him bringing up Janet’s wedding before realising that he really shouldn’t bring up weddings at that point.

&nbsp;


I remember her family… I remember the way they couldn’t even look at me…

&nbsp;


&nbsp;


You reach for the vial on the coffee table. With your right hand, you bring the needle of a cloudy syringe to its lips.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



I can only remember. I need to remember.
