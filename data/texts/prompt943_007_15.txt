This is my first attempt at writing. It might suck. but here goes.  


  


"The security council has convened and they're waiting for you, sir" said the officer as he gestured for me to get in the car.

&#x200B;

I get in without protest, watching as my confusion turns to terror: "What security council? What the hell did I do now? Look sir, I'm a scientist. You must be mistaken, whatever it is I had nothing to do..."

&#x200B;

"I see you haven't been briefed" he interrupted me. "This is a case of national security and you are being summoned in your capacity as a Digital Signal Processing expert for advise in a very sensitive matter. And that's as much as I'm authorized to say"

&#x200B;

"Heh, who would need my advise?" I murmur as if talking to myself.

&#x200B;

"This is unit 420 calling base, we have picked up our subject, heading to base, over" he speaks into his radio.

&#x200B;

"This is base to unit 420, confirmed. The prime minister awaits. Over"

&#x200B;

"You HAD to ask, now didn't you" I thought to myself

&#x200B;

The trip was short but it felt like ages. I had thousands of thoughts rushing through my head. In my mind I was calculating all the possible outcomes, trying to anticipate what it was the prime minister needed my advise in.

&#x200B;

I could feel every bump on the road in my stomach. Being an introvert was not really helping. The comfortable thought that I should be back in my lab, working on my boring research would pop in every few seconds. What I wouldn't give to have the opportunity to be working on even the most boring task, that one I had been putting off for weeks.

&#x200B;

The car pulls off, and I am escorted by two security personnel into a narrow hall to the chamber where the meeting was being held. Either they walked too fast, or I had trouble controlling my knees with all the adrenaline I had pumping through my blood, because I was struggling to keep up with their pace.

&#x200B;

"Thank you for coming on such short notice", the Minister of Defense says as he welcomes me into the security chamber. "You may close the door" he gestures to the officer who had escorted me in.

&#x200B;

"It's not like I had a choice" I thought to myself, as I nodded in agreement.

&#x200B;

"Please have a seat" the Prime Minister says from across the round table.

&#x200B;

I could recognize at least half the people seated around me, most of whom were army generals and heads of intelligence agencies. People I had only seen on the news, which I very rarely watch, if I ever have time for TV.

&#x200B;

On the table was an old clay jar that appears to be of historic nature. Next to the jar, was a device I immediately recognized. It was a prototype I had built 2 years prior as part of a now discontinued research project. I wasn't really surprised that they had found interest in my device as I had always believed it to hold great value. Except that it never really worked and the whole project was eventually abandoned as the funding ran dry.

&#x200B;

"We want you to explain to us, in human terms if possible, how your device works" says the prime minister.

&#x200B;

"Sure," I respond, "Think of sound as a ripple of water. If I drop a pebble in a pond of still water, it will produce a ripple. This ripple is in fact, a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium, in this case, water, just as sound propagates through air. As the ripple reaches the edges of the pond, it is reflected back and the process repeats".

&#x200B;

I continue, "Now as the wave travels back in the direction from whence it came, a great portion of the energy it carries is dissipated, in the form of heat generated by the friction caused by the back and forth motion of the water, and the destructive interference of the wave with itself. But although the energy grows weaker and weaker, the ripple itself never ends. It goes on and on, forever".

&#x200B;

I could tell that was what they wanted to hear, although it didn't seem new to them. After all it's all basic physics.

&#x200B;

"So by extension of what you just said, any sound produced at any moment - say a spoken word at a specific date - is basically trapped forever and can theoretically be captured and replayed even after the fact in say - a hundred thousand years", the general responds.

&#x200B;

"Theoretically, yes" I answer with a shallow smile. "The reality is a bit more complicated than that. See by measuring the amount of energy that a given sound signal carries, you can get an accurate pointer to when the sound was produced. After all, we know that energy decays at a very predictable rate. This can help us filter out the signals and isolate sounds originating at a specific date. However, the rate of energy decay is very specific to the medium in which the wave travels, and the materials on which it bounces. Without those parameters, it is impossible to reproduce the sound with any degree of fidelity". I explain.

&#x200B;

"But then, how does your device do it?" inquired the general

&#x200B;

"Well, simply sir, it doesn't. The device has only been demonstrated to work in computer simulations. We spent weeks trying to estimate the correct parameters that could emulate the properties of the medium and the material on which it was tested through a brute-force exhaustive search. Even then, we were only able to isolate signals that had been produced a few hours prior. However, when the device was actually built, we found that accurately estimating the rate of energy decay to be impossible."

&#x200B;

"What happened then?" asked the general.

&#x200B;

"The funding was running dry so the project was abandoned, and the prototype was later claimed by the folks down at he department of archaeology, if I recall correctly." I answered.

&#x200B;

Everyone seemed to be shocked to hear that. The room burst with murmurs and shouts of disbelief. Had I missed something? They all seem to know something that I didn't. I was suddenly no longer feeling like I was the most clever person in the room. The prime minister stands up, as the room falls again in a cautious silence.

&#x200B;

"I'm going to have to disagree with you, professor Francis" the Prime Minister says. "The folks at the department of archaeology seem to have had more patience than you did, professor. Your device does work. You may have given up too quickly, I'm afraid". He continues.

"What I'm going to show you now is going to shock you, and probably fill you with terror, as it has done us", he says, as he points the sensor to the clay jar that had perplexed me ever since I stepped into the room.

&#x200B;

To my surprise, the device - that normally would produce unintelligible noise - was actually outputting coherent speach. It sounded a lot like a man in distress.

"Adesh 'elak mesh eam tshe'lo wle hayawein... \[unintelligible\]... kol khara wle kalb... \[unintelligible\]... mosso wle'er"

&#x200B;

At that point, I was unable to contain my excitement. I stood up as I placed both my hands on my head and gently pulled on my hair. A feeling of great accomplishment swept over me. Two years of research that I had completely forgotten about had not been in vain.

&#x200B;

My excitement was brought to an abrupt end, when the general interrupts my little celebration: "Would you like to know what the voice in the jar is saying?" he asks?

&#x200B;

He hands me a piece of paper that had hieroglyphic signs scribbled on it, along with their english translation: "Space men descend from heaven. They burned sadom and gamorah. They come for gizah now"
