"Good morning New York! It's a beautiful Sunday, 9:05 AM. You're seeing playback from just minutes ago, when yet another crisis was averted by the spectacular Tri-Force! They sure made short work of the magma monster that emerged in Queens this morning, with zero casualties no less!" " You know Sarah, I can't imagine what New York would do without these wonder kids. I can't even get mine to mow the darn lawn!" "Oh, we know who wears the pants in your house, Steve. Julie - that's Steve's wife - she was telling me about the time that their younges-" __*click*__

I turned off the news, and exhaled deeply. 

"They really are getting better at the whole hero thing, year after year. Hell, a lot of folks on the internet spend their precious weekends arguing that they might be the best since Lt. Virtue or the Ghast Patrol. And I'm not gonna lie - of course that makes me proud as hell. But I'm still their dad. 

It's still nerve wracking, every single time they go speeding off. And it's not just the fear that they might get banished to an alternate dimension, or be sent hurtling into space through a damn portal, or mind controlled to fight each other... but even that someone's gonna out two and two together and realize that they're related to each other. These secrets aren't just theirs to keep. Their powers are disparate enough to keep people guessing but I can't afford to be hounded by the media if they find out! State Farm'd fire me in a heartbeat, and their superpowers aren't paying the mortgage, at least not mine.

Gabby's set for life. Ever since she met her "fairy" godmother and became __Motherboard__, she's been able to leverage the collective intellect of the galactic internet to build her fancy nanosuits and set herself up way past college with those stock market algorithms. She was smart as a whip ever since she could blink, so I suspect she always would have been fine. I only hope that she'll help mind her brothers. 

Derrick - I'm sorry, __Roach Lord__ - tells everyone he has an 'underground sewer lair' where 'he can fester with his kind,' and for the most part, the people buy it. There's a ton of debate or not whether his mask is actually his real head; Gabby's nanobots do a fantastic job matching up the mandibles, antennae and voice distortion with his speech and body language, and they help give his carapace that wet, grimy, look at all times, too. All the same, he's back home in seconds, and right back on the couch. He still won't apply to City College, either. Instead, he just spends every weekend lounging around playing videogames and "vaping." I can't exactly intimidate my slacker son when he has the proportionate strength, speed and nervous response of a giant cockroach, but damned if I don't still try in my own way. At least he's not a picky eater anymore.

His little brother Ryan is the exact opposite, just like his mother was. Big dreamer, head in the clouds, saying he's gonna start up his own super team in Tokyo when he's old enough to study abroad. He was born ready, bless him. His mother was in labor for 22 hours down in the basement, because conventional hospitals aren't equipped to help seal a cursed family's fox demon into their next son born under the blood moon. Michiko screamed like a banshee the whole way through, but she never said a cross word to me, and she didn't cry one bit. Not a single god damned tear. Strongest woman I ever knew. I miss her so much, I really do. But it took every last bit of that strength to bring Ryan into the world, and guide her out of it. Just the way it had to be, she said. 

You know, we both thought that he was a surprise, but deep down, I think she knew. She had to have planned down to the day. And he really is a miracle. __Kid Kaminari__, my little buddy is basically Son god damned Goku in the flesh. His brother and sister have no idea where his powers came from, so tally up another secret for dear old dad to keep close to the vest. But one day, something really, really dark is gonna come knocking, and that kid is destined to save the whole damn world when it does.

I'm sorry, I'm all full of bluster today."

"So... it's simple really. That really dark thing? That's you. That's where you come in, pops."

#__YOU WoULd DaRE tO uSE suCH an INDIGNANT TONE wiTh ME?!?__

"Yessir. Because you're not taking one step outside of that alchemical cage until our business is settled."

# __...SpeAk...__

"As I said, we both want Michiko back. I know you miss your daughter, and purgatory is no place for the Grand Ethereal Snake Princess. She can come back and grow old with me, then descend to take the infernal throne after a proper burial. But you're gonna have to kill these damn kids."

"I never said I fear for their safety, dummy. What I said was that each week, their little adventures escalate. It's been that way year after year, and at this point, they're far too good at what they do to be killed by any of these costumed dipshits or alien nimrods... if they get involved in some next level shit, how am I ever going to enact the ritual? I studied for years with your daughter and years beyond when she went soft and left me behind with these mistakes, one by one "blessed" for greatness by the gods... Give me a fucking break. But now there's only so much I can do as 'the evil Dr. Forneus.' Astral projections and magma monsters are just giving the brats a workout, and sooner rather than later they'll find out about all of it - who I am, what their mother was... and the deal I'm about to make with you. So let's make it skippy, pops. I'll release you from these bindings, and then...?"
