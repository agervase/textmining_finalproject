Now, I just want to say :

&nbsp;

I never intended to become The Greatest Evil, The Dark One, The Unseen Destroyer or whatever ridiculous title they're calling me nowadays.

By the way, my *name* is Rowan. Not that you'll hear anybody use it aside from me, since everybody's too fixated on that whole Evil thing and nobody even remembers it.

&nbsp;

Wait, where was I ?

Right, never really wanted to become the bad guy.

It's just...do you have any idea how *boring* it gets, being a nigh-omnipotent physical god ? Not to mention all the temporal shenanigans, time loops, time travel, paradoxes, time dilation and so on. When somebody seals me for all eternity, can't they at least pack a few books inside the godsdamned tin can they use to do so ?!

But I'll admit, maybe I shouldn't have played with those meteors, way back at the beginning.

&nbsp;

All the same. **Does this warrant fifteen million years of subjective time spent running from various Chosen Ones ?!**

At first it was funny. And it kept on being funny for a long time.

They all took themselves so *seriously*, I couldn't help but play along. Make a few dramatic speeches, intentionally leave flaws in whichever magical artifact of DOOM! I'm using at the moment.

And when it got too boring, I waited for the hero to start his monologue, then pretended to fall asleep. On average, it took them eight minutes and seventeen seconds to realize.

Good times.

But they just kept coming, and even the funniest gag eventually gets stale.

So I started running.

I really don't get why they continued chasing me after that. I mean, I was never a very deadly opponent (if I killed people, I always made sure the hero found some trinket that would reverse all my actions), and at that point, I was just running away from them as fast as I could and doing nothing besides.

It *was* admittedly impressive. Especially that one girl who had &mdash; what was it ? &mdash; the Sun's Blood, right, which conferred immortality. Very single-minded, very persistent.

Took me a good four million years to lose her.

Anyway, after a while, the quality of Chosen Ones began to drop. Shoddy swords, teenagers instead of full-grown adults, discount magical rings...you name it, I've seen it.

But still.

I don't think I'm a good guy (or a bad guy), but even *I* have standards.

When I heard the knock on the door, I paused.

Sighed.

Closed my book.

Massaged my temples.

Sighed again, just for good measure.

Then got up, walked briskly through my lavishly furnished room, the somber corridor beyond, navigated the maze supposed to keep me in without pausing, floated over the spike pit, the acid pool, the dart trap, the *poisoned* spike pit, the acid-tipped dart trap, the slightly more shallow acid pool, moonwalked over the Endless Chasm, and promptly tripped over that godsdamned step just before the self-opening front door of the Obsidian Temple.

I swear, I don't know how it always gets me. I mean, I saw the Temple get constructed around me (and promptly stole it for my own use (as in, I waited until everybody was out of it and just teleported it in the wastelands)) and lived there for tens of thousands of years and I still don't know how they managed to make it impossible *not* to trip over that step.

And so, the first impression the newest Chosen One &mdash; because really who else would walk all the way here ? &mdash; had of Me, The Greatest Evil, The Dark One, The Unseen Destroyer, and known as Rowan to absolutely *nobody* was me faceplanting in front of them.

In other words : *it was just that kind of day*.

The newest Chosen One, audibly repressing chuckles, asked me "Um, are you alright, mister ?" in a too-high voice.

Much too high, in fact.

I lifted my head just enough to take a look at him.

The corner of my eye twitched.

_He was **six years old** at **most**_.

Small, scrawny, brown-haired, and with suspiciously puppy-like brown eyes, dressed in worn-out, secondhand clothes.

Now, I didn't have much hope left, but I still had to confirm the depressing conclusion I'd reached.

So I casually picked myself off the ground, waving off his concern.

"Don't worry, I'm fine. So you knocked ? Did you want something ?"

He just shrugged, accidentally scraping the sword on his back &mdash; as tall as he was &mdash; on the ground.

"Not sure. Some weird old man with a beard grabbed me off the street, gave me this sword, said something about a Chosen One, and then I was here."

...

"Freaking wizards." My sigh expressed the weariness of someone who'd had one too many Merlin wannabes shout at them.

Judging by the snort I heard, the opinion was mutual.

Alright.

Not like I was going to stay around, anyway. However, this latest bout of stupidity born of the lowest pits of human intelligence was the last straw.

A godsdamned six-year old.

But, first things first.

"What's your name, kid ?"

"Michael."

"Okay. You an orphan ?" I questioned, walking to the edge of the Temple to check on the levitation runes, and on my...little project.

A sound of agreement.

"Anything you'd miss back home ?"

In a tone that dripped sarcasm, he answered, "I lived on the streets, mister."

I liked him already.

Walking back towards the entrance, I grabbed him by the armpits without breaking stride. I ignored the resulting sound of protest and settled him on my shoulders.

"I'm either kidnapping you or adopting you. We're going to make a small side trip to shave that bearded moron's facial hair in a most painful manner, and then we're leaving here," I said, gesturing around me as I finished.

"Um...leaving..."

"This universe. I've decided I need a," and here I paused to spit the foulest curse I knew, "vacation. So I decided I'm going to explore the multiverse."

There was a moment of silence, followed by a completely deadpan "Okay."

And that was the day The Greatest Evil, The Dark One, The Unseen Destroyer, also known by a population of one as Rowan, left this moronic world behind for pastures that, hopefully, while not greener, at least didn't feed a species that was actively breeding out any spark of intelligence its members might demonstrate while averaging a neuron for every dozen idiots.

Wait.

"By the way, name's Rowan."

Population of *two*.
