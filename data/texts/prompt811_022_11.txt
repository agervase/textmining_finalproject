 “You've been here, what, ten years?” Cameron asked me. 

I raised my head slightly from my doubled over position, “I didn't know there was a clock on eternity. Does time even work that way here?” 

“It doesn't really work at all here, but you can keep track of the surface time if you care to do so,” he replied. “Either way, you've been here long enough that shouldn't still be vomiting after assignments.”  

The knots in my stomach eased enough for me to stand upright. “It's just the killing and the torture. I do the other ones fine now, but there's something about taking lives that still does me in.” 

“Never thought I'd see a squeamish killer in here, but it takes all kinds I guess.”   Cameron's eyes drifted over to the markings on my arms. The branding tattoo left the mark of a hangman's knot along my forearm signifying to those in hell that I was a murderer. The number of coils above the collar proved that it was premeditated, the red tint indicated the act was carried out in true malice, and the barren tree within the collar indicated that it was personal. My victim was family.  

“Attempted killer,” I quipped back, pointing to the break in the collar's circle. “I got here purely on intent rather than actually completing the act.” 

“Funny how those rules work,” Cameron said. I smiled back at him, a grotesque action while in demon form, but a hard habit to shake for those who died young. He knew my story and had taken me under his wing when I arrived in hell those years ago. I had learned a good bit from him on Hell's rules and how to properly use my demonic powers. He was as close to a friend as a demon could have.   
 “You done for the day?” he asked. “I think so. That's all I had scheduled”   As the answer rolled off my tongue I felt the familiar tug of displacement starting. Another job was calling. I let out a sigh as I lifted my hand to my brand to tap out. It was a way of passing on a job to someone else when you were otherwise engaged. There were limits on it's use but I rarely skipped as there wasn't much else to do in Hell. I drew the sigil over my brand and focused on shifting the displacement onward to the next demon available, but nothing happened. Looking at Cameron I tried again to no avail. “Ok don't panic,” he started. “When this happens either the big guy is calling for you specifically or..” “Or?” I said feeling my body start to shift. “Or it's pers-” 

  
His voice faded as I was ripped across the planes. His words lingered as I entered the human realm and looked around to get my bearings. A wave of dejavu hit as I focused my vision. Coming out of the planar shift wreaked havoc on the senses when you weren't ready for it.  A small girl cowering in a corner caught my eye. “Are you h-here to help m-me?” Her voice was somehow smaller than she was. The words seemed to catch in her throat as she spoke and I could barely make them out over the TV behind me. *She can't be a day over nine years old. Far too young, how was she even able to summon me?* The thoughts appeared in my mind as I took in more of the room. “Little girl, I'm not sure who told you of my kind but you do not want my help. Nor can I give it to you,” I tried to answer her. It wasn't the first I'd heard of kids stumbling onto spells or runes for a ritual without knowing what they were getting into, but it was the first time I'd had it happen. This is why the rules were put in place to begin with. 

“This was a mistake,” I said aloud to no one in particular.   I began to draw the runes to shift back to where I belonged. “Please help me. Mommy said you would help me,” her timid voice dripped with an anxious fear that was palpable to my enhanced senses. I looked down at her raised chin to see bruises on her face and neck. It was par for the course for what I usually am exposed to now, yet seeing those marks on one so young was new. But it was not my job to get involved. In fact, I'd be violating a treaty to do so. Besides, there were many who were suffering in the world. This girl was just another of the unfortunates.   
 

“Madison Marie where are you? Do make me have to find you, you little shit!” The voice froze me. I heard him stumbling at the top of the nearby stairs and watched her try to make herself even smaller in her corner. *Thud, thud, thud.* The sound of his boots on the steps echoed through the still house drowning out the sounds of a surrounding city and the cartoons playing on screen. The creak of old wood as he hit the fourth step sent a shiver down my spine. I searched for the girl as she'd moved to another corner, trying to find safety in that room. My eyes found the markings on wall above when she crouched, silently pleading for my help. Height markings. A series of new blue lines accompanied the old green ones that had almost been worn away with age.     
  

His boots clapped against the final step, sounding out in the tone of my childhood nightmares. After all these years he still hadn't replaced the carpet we had to cut away after the dog mangled the lowest step.     


“Father,” I turned to greet him. I saw him blink multiple times before wiping his eyes. The form I had taken was not the child he expected to see. “What do you want you little brat? I thought I killed you,” he slurred through the words. The was no remorse in his voice, only well nurtured spite and anger for the twelve year old girl in front of him. 

“You did. I think I still have the scar,” I answered, barely able to hold this form that spoke with the innocence that he'd ended. He had given me plenty of scars to remember him by. “I thought I had killed you as well, but I guess that's the wonders of modern medicine.” 

“You couldn't hurt me, you love me too much,” he laughed as I grit my teeth. “Go away now. I know it's like all the other times. You're not real and I gotta find your sister before somebody sees her. These days people don't understand proper discipline.”     
 

His words confirmed my suspicion. The night that I had tried to kill him he was beating my mother. Again. *“You think we can afford that? Get rid of it!”* He had yelled at her before punching at her stomach again. I had thought about it for weeks before then, but before I knew it I was actually holding the knife and running at him. My childish frame wasn't strong and my bruised limbs didn't help, but the blade was sharp. It bit into his skin easily and tore at his flesh as I slashed and stabbed with abandon. It wasn't enough.     
  

“Unfortunately for you I am real,” I said releasing the hold I had over my form. He looked up to my now towering form. No longer the fragile toy he could exert his power over I saw fear take hold of him.  “Also unfortunate for you, the only reason I died that day instead of you is because I didn't have the strength to kill you,” my voice hissed with a hatred that I had repressed. I looked over to the sister that I never got to know looking up at the two of us and finally recognized my mother's eyes on her. “That, I can assure you, is no longer a problem.”

“Something's a bit different about you,” Cameron said. “Are the wings new? I swear I'm getting worse at keeping track of things.” “Yeah, a special bonus from Lucy himself for my last job,” I answered with a smile. “So you finally finish an assignment without losing your stomach and you're already on a nickname basis with him? You're moving on up in the world. Or down rather,” he said returning the smile. “So what'd you have to do to swing those?” he asked. His eyes traced over the large wings protruding from my frame and the lengthened horns above my head.     


 “Apparently I did some really good marketing.”
