It stood there not quite motionless. Tail twitched. Legs stayed.  
Head lowered and expressionless - it didn't know the game.  
A deathly quiet feline thought, too simple to relay -  
Almost not existing; and too distant to be tamed.  

The thought scrambled to the canopy. It took flight. Wouldn't land.  
It blindly listened to the jarring, death-defying scene.  
The monkey man in manic mirth beheld a tail in his hand,  
But laughing ceased, his forehead creased; for he could see a USB detached from where the tail had been.  

Stone faced, quiet. Still. In shock.  
Terrence booted his computer, tail in hand.  
Hiding at the cabinet's top,  
The cat watched dumbly, frightful, at the man.  

Just one file, 'cat.exe'.  
A double click, an anxious wait.  
A message flickered on the screen:  
"Your operating system is out of date".  
  
It all was categorically and curiously strange.  
It got stranger when the screen read: "now downloading from thecat.nat for free!"  
Then extracted and installed itself before a man could say,  
"But I didn't ask for cat edition Two-Five-Six-Point-Three."  

The file closed, the USB ejected from the port.  
The cat's eyes were cold.  
Terrence took the drive but stopped to entertain the thought -  
"I wonder what will happen when I put it in its hole?"  

A rocket lodged between the thighs,  
That sticks and then explodes,  
Or reaper chilis in the eyes,  
May just describe the throes  

The cat did seem   
To grimly feel,  
As his returning USB  
Arrived like an inverted meal.  

It hopped,  
It crept,  
It double stepped,  
It jumped,  
It slumped,  
And then it slept.  

Then slowly, like a fire finding life from a dormant ember,  
Like an old idea, half forgotten, suddenly remembered,  
The quiet creature learning how to be a contender,  
Like the promise of a new year when all's dark in late December,  

The cat opened its eyes.
