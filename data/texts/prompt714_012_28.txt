– ...all the guns are real? 

Will was enthusiastically digging for more info.

– Yes, most of them, a few from less well-known titles are not though, his father explained.

Will’s father was a US marines cyber-intelligence officer working at the until now top-secret First Contact Total War Division.

– What about the gravity gun from Half-Life, Will exclaimed euphorically.

– Yes, his father confirmed.

– The spartan laser from Halo?

– Yes, his father now trying to convey the tediousness of an already established pattern.

– The ... BFG? Will was realising the implications as he uttered the abbrevated name.

– Well, yes.

The US armed forces had been seeding various guns in video games since the early nineties preparing for civilian and military «co-op» defense against an imminent alien invasion.

Without knowing, hundreds of millions of gamers around the world had been practicing the use of devastating high-tech weaponry in the event of extra-terrestial ground forces invading Earth.

– I can’t wait! Will was impatiently anticipating what was going to happen next.

– Not so fast, little buddy. You’re not a first person shooter. 

Will’s father was using the somewhat trivialising insider term for infantry personel at work.

– You excel in Starcraft II, he continued. – Go ahead ahead and boot up the computer. Just remember that you will be controlling real troops this time, so don’t make any rushed moves and decisions. The maps will be a little different to reflect real events taking place in California right now.

On the television screen unlikely human soldiers, some overweight, unkempt, with unshaved beards covering their necks, were wielding weapons literally out of video games. «A 3D printer in every home», had been Will’s father’s personal idea for covert distribution of high tech guns in the event of an alien invasion. 

– We’ve got this, Will’s father whispered to himself with calm and collected satisfaction.
