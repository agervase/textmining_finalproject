  

I open my eyes. No difference.

My head starts aching.

I feel the vibration. The movement. I am in a car. 

I try to move. Not much happening. Tied up. Usually I would enjoying this but I kind of didn’t intend to be tied up. Or did I?  
 What was the last thing?

Merry’s birthday? The bar afterwards? That cutie how bought me that one drink to many?

Yep. Mister Cutie. 

I must have done something right to get him THAT interested.

Still, hats off he got me into the car.

I stretch as much as possible.

The car stops.

I am EXCITED.

The trunk opens and in the blinding light my eyes open in horror.

He looks even cuter than I remember!

I start making noises.

“Shut up.”

He cuts through the rope on my legs. A rough guy. I like it.

Let’s play rough!

He drags me by the arms until I fall out of the car on my knees. Goodbye leggings I bought yesterday. Yesterday? No idea.

He drags me on my legs and I fight back. He slaps me in the face.

I squeal. Ooh, really rough it is. 

He pushes me towards a log in the middle, is it the middle? Probably it is, of the woods. How classy he is! Exciting!

He shoves me through the open door, I fall.

By my handcuffs he drags me to a wooden pillar and attaches the cuff above my head.

I start to get nervous. 

What have I gotten myself into again?

He walks towards the other side of the log.

I feel my thumbs dislocating.

The next thing he feels, is a hit on the back of his head.

He drops down holding it screeching in pain. I love pans.

I smack him again. His face hits the ground.

I jump on his back. I feel his lungs emptying. No way he can get up now. Not with 120 kg of fat and muscle on him. He tries indeed though, his hands grasping in the air as if he is trying to swim away.

I take out my hair needle.  
 “So you like it rough?” I ask him unscrewing the top of the wooden hair needle, revealing a second, much thinner one.

“I kind of like it more delicate.” I whisper in his ear seductively, driving the needle with my body weight into his spine.

Merry opens the door.

I am pissed. “You are so hell fucking late madam! Food is almost ready!”

Wordlessly, Merry looks at the arm and leg less Torso on the floor.

She starts taking of the jacket.

“Everything else still attached?” She asks eyeing Mr. Cutie.

“You brought the Viagra?” I throw back.

“As always.” She smirks.

“But wait! Desert only after dinner!” I start serving the appetisers.

Gentleman fingers.
