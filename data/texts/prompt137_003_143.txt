***December 1982***  
Imagine it. You're walking down the street when suddenly a stranger grabs you in a great bear hug and kisses you with more love, sentiment and passion than you've ever felt in your entire life- which in my case, had been a pretty weird life.

That was the first time I met Quill, or Daniel Aquilla Fairchild, as he would introduce himself to you if you were 'actually' a stranger. An introduction- and a person- I'd never forget.

"Smells delicious."  
He smiled. 
"It should do. I learned this recipe from the head-chef of Julius Caesar himself."  
I rolled my eyes.  
"Of course."  
"*Tantum habentes!* One day I'll take you there, my dear" he beamed, slipping my coat off and leading me by the hand to the kitchen. He'd laid out the table beautifully- candles (no procured doubt from Ancient Rome itself), four glistening glasses of wine (Napoleon's favourite, he'd go on to tell me), and...
"Darling, the silverware's wrong."  
"Wrong?"  
"You've put the knives and forks the wrong way round."   
"I have not! I grew up with the finest Victorian etiquette. I assure you, they're right."  
"Your staff laid the table for you."   
He wrinkled his nose. Although he'd done his best to learn self-sufficiency, he sometimes messed up with the inconsequential things. Suddenly I felt terrible- oh god, he didn't realise I was joking with him.  
"Don't worry, baby" I said, rearranging the cutlery, "I'm just teasing you; it's no big deal." I eyed his flour-coated apron. "Come on, lets go get changed before the guests arrive."

***March 1983***  
I eyed the contraption on his wrist. It was bulky, sure. But a time machine? I doubted it.   
"Prove it," I challenged him, meeting his eyes. They twinkled with something I didn't quite recognise. Yet.  
"If you're game."  
Suddenly his hands were on my waist, lifting me slightly into the air. Wow. He was stronger than he looked. I blushed like a schoolgirl as he pulled me tightly into his body.  
"Where would you like to go?" he said in a low, slightly gruff voice as he shifted my weight onto one arm to tinker with the watch-like machine.  
"Anywhere," I breathed.

***November 1997***  
I shouted out, deep like a groan, as the bullet spat out of the other side of my abdomen. I clutched my side. The car went speeding off into the night.  
"Motherfucker. A drive-by?"  
Already I could feel my body healing itself, working is repairing magic. Didn't make it hurt any less though.  
I was suddenly aware of someone running towards me.  
"Dear lord! Ma'am, were you hit?"  
A brown overcoat-clad figure dove into a kneeling position beside me.  
"Oh, Quill. How are you?" I smiled, voice hoarse.  
"No time for pleasantries, woman! I'm new to this town, where can I go to find your local doctor? You've been shot!"  
"I'm aware, Quill."  
"No, you don't understa-" suddenly he stopped. "Pardon?"  
"Did you just call me 'woman'?" I laughed.  
"I'm sorry, Ma'am, have we met before?"  
I couldn't help but grin as he said that. This was it, I realised.  
 The first time we met, in his perspective.  

Payback time.  

Body almost healed and energy restored, I quickly turned towards him, grabbed him by the face, and gave him the strongest kiss I could muster. When our lips finally parted, he rocked back on his heels, cheeks turned deep red. His mouth hung agape. I couldn't help it- I giggled. That stupid, gorgeous face of his.  

 
"We have now," I winked.

I actually had the idea for a time-traveller/immortal couple before, but I hadn't written about them yet. This prompt inspired me to finally do it :) I know the genders are reversed, but hey, oh well. I'd love to hear any feedback or critique, especially if you think this reads as too fanfic-y or if you want to hear any other scenes that could play out with these two.
