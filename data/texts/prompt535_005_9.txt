"My girlfriend just bought me a new controller for my Xbox. I'm literally walking on sunshine."

I laughed. What a braggart. He just meet the girl a few months ago and now he's figuratively head over heels. What's worst is that he's likely taking on the cadence's of his girlfriend with all his "Literally" this and that crap. I mean, it was bad before, but now it's taken a life of it's own and magnified itself to the point of an adolescent pop loving school girl. I rolled my eyes and went back to Reddit. At least there, we don't tolerate such crap. That would have been down voted to Oblivion. I grabbed my cup of coffee and headed out of the Starbucks feeling accomplished after I did my mandatory research and paper write up. I flicked down and smiled as I saw a post about a  kitten taking a nap under a guys fedora, Detective kitten was upvoted. 'Look at this neckbearded pussy!' upvoted. I chuckled and took a sip of coffee before bumping into a guy just standing in the street.

"Sorry about that." The guy didn't even look back, just stared up. "Alright I guess I'll just walk arou-" I noticed there was a crowd. All looking up. Man, people are fucking weird in New York. I took another sip of coffee and looked up as well to see if maybe it was another advertisement billboard with some smiling celebrity. 

"WwAAAAAAHHHOOOO!" I spat out my coffee, my eyes bulged in disbelief. There was Spencer, hopping and laughing... Walking.... On pure sunshine. 

"SPENCER DUDE YOURE LITERALLY WALKING ON SUNSHINE!" -me

"He's trying to make fun of your use of the word literal. It doesn't matter, the context clearly shows it was meant figuratively. I am really annoyed by these grammar Nazis."

I stared at the cellphone photo he posted of him taking a selfie while in a moon crater, I was freaking out as I sat on the park bench. Staring at my phone yelling profanities. No one seemed to notice or care. 

"Lol, nice Photoshop bro 😂"

"Sure, me and my girlfriend are going to the Zoo later. We can meet up there. We are literally going to let the dogs out and have a ball 😂"

👍X10 👎x0 ❤️x3

I stepped out of the Uber I called, and watched in amazement as a panicked crowd of people tried to avoid zoo officials that were attempting to quarantine off a section of the park while animal tamers entered with sticks with a snare on one end. I saw Spencer and his blonde girlfriend not far from there. He was waving a large red ball around smiling. I jogged over, my heart drumming up to the anticipation of the conversation about a paranormal event that I now knew was very real. 

"Hey Shawn, what's up?" He held out a fist for me to bump, which I did absent mindedly as I looked back at the small emergency that was unfolding in the section containing the wild dogs exhibit. 
"Did you literally let those dogs out?" 
"ROO ROO ROO RO ROOO!!" his girlfriend replied in her thick Australian accent. She jumped up and down so her dirty blonde hair bounced around her face. Spencer laughed. "Yeah, I literally told you I would."
"Holy shit." I muttered. "Spence, today I saw you literally walking on sunshine downtown! What the hell is going on?" His girlfriend raised an eyebrow "Aww he knows now?" "Same thing that has always been going on. Did you really think I didn't know how to use the word literal? Haha" I combed back my hair in stress. 
"Will all visitors please evacuate the following exhibits; the African Wild Dogs exhibit, the Carter Giraffe exhibit and the Congo gorilla Forrest until further notice. Thank you"

"So you have powers? Can you control it? Is it ok if I do a paper on this? This is incredible! You could change the way everyone looks at the world!"
"Haha, sure. But no I can't control it. Just happens. Like a bladder leak. Speaking of, can you hold this, I need to go." He handed me the red ball he had cradled under an arm and jogged toward a restroom area. 
"Oh my God! Can you believe this?" I interjected to his girlfriend "Yesterday when he said he was literally on the moon, he was literally there!" 
"Alright mate settle down, you're looking like a bloody weirdo here." I wrinkled my forehead in confusion and more than a little bit of anger at the fact that she didn't seemed as in shock at the incredulous. "Well I don't know about Australia, but here in America people don't usually literally walk on sunshine. " "Well maybe they do, but you just think they weren't doing it literally all along." Oh no. One of those types. The type that blindly believes in every and any phenomenon because it makes the world just a bit more interesting. She'd believe it if I said I shat gold nuggets. I needed to talk to Spencer. I wondered to what extent his ability went, could he write it out and force it to happen? Or did it happen and then he wrote about it? Causality or happenstance? Where did he get these abilities? How long did he have them?! I was lost in thought until I heard Spencer's voice shout out. 
"Hey guys! Look! This is hilarious!"
I spun around and nearly fell on my ass. Knuckling toward us was a 400lb silverback gorilla, smiling. 
"It's me! Spencer!"
"Aww"
"AHHHH!!"
"Roo, here take my cell and snap a picture of me please." His girlfriend obliged. Spencer, now a 400lb silverback gorilla, sat gloomily under a tree. His rotound gut protruding out from between his legs. He raised his hand and flipped the bird to the camera. His girlfriend snapped a photo and laughed. "How the hell are you doing this?"
"Honestly I'm not entirely sure." He said smiling as he got back his phone. I checked his Facebook.

"Literally me when the haters show up 😂"
