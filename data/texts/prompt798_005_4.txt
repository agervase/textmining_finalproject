You had just got rid of the acres of wheat that had appeared after a particularly violent vomit at university.

You’d think it would have sold for some money, wiped out some of the colossal debt you had run up with all of your ‘media studies’, which had consisted of watching films, smoking, drinking, and other things its best not to mention.

Turns out trying to sell on any goods which you have summoned from the ether catches the attention of the authorities, who usually suspect some sort of money laundering.

You had been 7 when it had first happened. A strange sneeze, the kind which covers the closest surface or person with mucus and leads to people looking shyly away, as though the child responsible could have done anything to prevent it. What was strangest was the 4 donkeys which had appeared in the corner of the classroom at the same moment. You, and all the other children, were amazed to have a magician as a teacher. He was bemused and less impressed. The next time you had been on your own on a walk back from college, and had managed to lose the swarm of rats on your way home, luckily.

But this was ridiculous, and when Liz arrived home she was going to flip. She wasn’t scared of them, it could have been worse. It could have been spiders.

I don’t think she’d be much happier with the house full of snakes though. Why on earth were they so primitive 4,500 years ago, and why hadn’t they invented anything better, like jewellery or modern money. You put your head against the steering wheel of your car, staring down your driveway at your locked front door, and tells snake trying to make its escape from the letter box. You considered stepping back into the house, thinking it might be the better option.

Liz was going to kill you anyway.
