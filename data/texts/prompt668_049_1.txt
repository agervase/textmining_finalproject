"Yeah, didn't expect to see us here, did we?"

"So I'm the person who hurt myself the most?"

"Who else?"

"I'd have thought..."

"We'd have thought" 

"... Maybe like Lisa or Harry or whoever was driving that Van."

"Oh yeah, cause physical pain is the be all end all"

"You know what I meant"

"We do know what we meant and we are being a little bitch about things, even now"

"I'm dead!"

"Everyone here is, it comes with the territory."

"How am I meant to take this then?! Confront the person who hurt me the most so that I can move on? What kind of crap is this? I don't want to be dead"

"Well, we are, so either we make the most of it just sit here in self pity, like always"

"I still don't get it though. What am i meant to be doing here? It was never my fault how things ended up"

"Never our fault? Mate, do you hear ourself? 

"Why... Why are you being such a dick?"

"Because we are a dick. We always have been. People didn't leave us. They were pushed away. There would be no one but us to confront by the end anyway. So this all fits no matter what."

"Is there meant to be a lesson here? Cause I still don't get it"

"We're pretty thick too, we guess."

"Just tell me"

"Alright, fine, lets be lazy. We're meant to forgive whoever hurt us the most, so that we can move on. Forgive against ones worst enemy being a true mark of a good person and all that."

"Forgive what?! I didn't do anything?!" 

"We're going to be here a while then."

"Just shut up! Just stop talking, I need to just think.... Whatever, fuck, I just need to forgive myself go to heaven. I can do that"

"How do we expect to do that while we are shutting up and not talking to ourselves?" 

"I've spent like spent like 5 minutes with you and I already fucking hate you. You're a fucking pedantic asshole. I wish you'd just fuck off somewhere!"

"Yes. We do."
