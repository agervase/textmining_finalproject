"Nosenog," the hooded figure said. Why would anyone want me to tell them 'nosenog'? I don't get it. Thinking of it as a novelty I wrote it in my phone calendar with a reminder on January 1st 2070.


***51 years later***

"I'M GOING TO DO IT SHARON!!!" Screaming from the top of the Empire State building. A few hours ago I found out my wife of 30 years had been cheating on me and none of my children were my own. 
"I LOVED THOSE KIDS AND NOW THEY WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME!!" 

"THEY LOVE YOU!! JUST COME DOWN HERE AND WE CAN TALK THROUGH THIS!!!"

New year's Eve was a long night I don't had no idea I could get so tired just from standing on a ledge. Watching the ball drop I thought about how my life had fallen. "Same," I thought as the ball reached it's lowest point

"WHO IS THAT UP THERE WITH YOU," One of the emergency personnel called up.  I didn't bring anyone up here so that was a surprise. Looking around I saw a windbreaker wearing dude with hair that had frosted tips. "DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!" I yelled at this weirdo.

Is that my phone? 

"Notification, Nosenog."

"What did it say?" Asked my unwelcomed rooftop guest.

"Nosenog."

*Silence*

"Bwahahahahaha!!!!!" The man started rolling on the floor with laughter. When he composed himself he stood up brushed himself off and thanked me, "man Brent had the best jokes, you see we're time travelers and we tell each other jokes scattered around town. You just happened to be the lucky shmuck that had the punch line. Thanks for playing." He started to fiddle with something in his pocket.

"W-w-w-what was the joke?" I tried to ask nonchalantly, as if I wasn't in the middle of a break down standing on a ledge. 

"Oh man only 90's kids would get it."

And I threw myself off the ledge.
