    He's at it again, Paul thought irritably. Bangs and whistles were emanating from the floor below him, and Paul's cat had ran up his leg and clung there. Pulling Amber off his thigh, he marched downstairs to confront his renter. Paul banged on his renters door, hoping he could be heard over the noise. The door swung open immediately, and there his renter stood, one hand on the door and the other on the frame.
    
    Ben Adam was eccentric to say the least. His dress was about a century out of date, as he wore suit pants, a button up shirt, with overalls. He was tall, just over six feet, and his conical head always bumped against the door-frame. His skin was a dark hue of moldy green, his hands had six fingers, and the eyes behind his plastic glasses had horizontal slits. Underneath a fake, black mustache was a host of octopus tentacles that flicked and twitched erratically.
    
    "Are you dissatisfied with the current state of being?" Ben Adam inquired, raising his voice to be heard.
    
    "Can you quiet it down?!" Paul hollared back, "You're making too much noise!"
    
    Mr Adam's eyes widened. He glanced back quickly at a giant metal contraption that seemed to be the source of the noise, before readjusting his body to try and hide it. He didn't do a very good job of it, but Paul pretended not to notice.
    
    "I will immediately commit to this task of noise reduction!" Mr Adam slammed the door shut, and within a few moments the noise dropped to an almost unnoticeable hum. Paul sighed with relief and return to his own apartment. Sitting back on his couch with Amber, he mulled over his queer tenant. He had his oddities sure, and he was quite clearly not from Earth, but in the end Paul didn't mind that much. And it didn't hurt that he paid three times the normal rent. "Three-Hundred and Twenty Five Units of Standard Local Currency!" Mr Adams had told him upon payment. Paul could live with a bit of noise now and then.
