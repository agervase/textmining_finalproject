The cancer had spread through out my pancreas and liver, I wanted to live for my children, but a part of me wanted to see what was on the other side of death. My life was fulfilled, I had a few properties to gift to my two sons after my passing, Christopher and Jack were strong lads even though they were only young. My wife had previously died from a failed liver transplant it devastated me, I didn't have time for my boys so because I was working double to keep my boys in private education. So my dear mother looked after them the sweat hearted pensioner, I was afraid she wouldn't have long either.

I soon faded to black and let my body slide into a calming sleep, it had been working so hard to fight but it couldn't take it anymore. In this abysmal darkness was a table made of a dark wood, it was far away in the distance so i attempted to step forward but I ended up somehow hitting the desk with my knee. I had somehow teleported, on the table a blindingly white A3 paper sat undisturbed with two tick boxes marked in ink. Above each box it said are you 'yes' and 'no', at the top of the paper it asked the question "Are you from Earth?". No pen was in sight so I touched the 'yes' box with my finger, it glowed a bright light and everything went white as if I had become one with the paper I once sat in front of.

Confused I looked around and was about to shout where am I, but before I could even speak a voice bellowed "The Aether"

To be continued...

I know this isn't much but it's a start for the rest of you guys :)
