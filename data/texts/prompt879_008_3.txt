"Your wish shall be granted.  Viel Glück!"

"Gleichfalls..."  I didn't like the sound of that _Viel Glück_.

Time shrunk, morphed, and metamorphosed itself from 2016 to 1994.  The quick glitter of buildings once built torn into oblivion, the pavements once orderly itself into an disorganized mess, and cars once lively and bustling in their city hustle fashion were smaller.

I got up from the bench at a nearby bus stop and examined the surroundings.  What was once organized into one of the busiest intersections became one of the smaller, slower intersections.  Staples toward Downtown did not seem too lively as a few apartment complexes dot the landscape.  Opposite of Staples laid a street once held and cuddled by a large swath of trees with large leaves.  The trees, recently seen by my past self in the 80s, covered the streets with very little sunlight and provided the cool, the beautiful scenery...  A scenery in 1994 no longer there due to land development.

Saratoga wasn't busy yet as it is morning, almost striking noon.  I knew what I had to do.  I had been preparing myself for years, wondering what I would do in order to make myself 'cease' to exist and birth a new future me.  I pulled out the note to make sure it remained intact.

Alas, it is definitely intact.  Here's what I wrote.

*Dear Ait Convarion,*

*This letter was intended for you to read at the quickest notice.  Many things will progress to the point where you will wish, like me, to go back in time and change the one thing that would irrevocably alter your future.*

*First, let me tell you what the future holds for you at this present time. You will grow up doing so well in high school in your first year, suffer horribly in the last three years.  You will end up dropping out of your first college, the second, and so on until you find your programming and business administration degree, studied German, and finally lived in Germany for quite a while.  You will become one of the best Geschäftführers ever lived, accomplished stick driving with a cochlear implant, and finally got laid at 40, no doubt to a vixen at 18.  All of this will be parallel to your father.*

*Your father suffered under your grandfather.  He was a rebel, much like you.  He did so well yet did so much to cause disdain.  He became an adulterer, having sex with married women, seeking wealth to alleviate the suffering of poverty, and graduated from college too late in his life.  His death will bring you no remedy, no cure, and no solace.  His death will be a mixed bag of bitterness, suffering, and altogether conflicted.  Do not seek to understand his apology to you before he died.  Know that his apology will come far much late, underscoring the significance of your future problem.*

*You have a choice.  Choose to do or don't.  I will not interfere as I cannot directly help you.  I can only send you messages to guide you while I rebuild myself again.  If you do wish to accept my guidance, write "yes" in red on an envelope and place it in the barn inside your father's shed, on top of that tool table. Do not seek me.  Know that I will receive your messages at night.*

*Understand that I am willing to ensure that you have a great future, a much better one than your father ever will.  You will not only become one of the best Geschäftführers ever lived in Germany, but you will also become wealthy.  You will eclipse your father and arouse his fears of you becoming greater than he ever will be.  The only downside to this is you will lose certain things in your life...  There will be no Tobias Saunders.  There will be no Dranmury Follet.  You will have new friends but you will become successful far earlier, get laid earlier, and still be married to that 18-year-old vixen at 40.*

*Keep in touch and do not be alarmed.  I am not here to hurt you.  I'm here to guide you.  Auf Wiedersehen!*

*Ihr Freund,*

*Ait Convarion*

Well, that's that. I'm glad that this letter was kept intact.  I look down the street where the trees once graced the streets.  *Here I go...*  I walk down the street, knowing where I was supposed to go.

I sweated for at least an hour, walking around the curved bend outside the city limits.  As I approached this large line of palm trees, towered over by one lone palm tree on top of a perched gravel road, the barn and the house was visible.  To the far right was a nice beautiful home, much spacious, and with it adjacent a storage barn, once having stored a Cessna.  I knew who flew that Cessna but that was in the 80s.

I checked that blue house with white shutters to see if any vehicles were parked in front of that fence.  Hmm...  No one was there.  *This could do.*  I entered the gravel road, heading to the barn.  I checked inside.  The stalls were empty save one.  A neigh reared itself into the air.

"Stan...  Long time no see...  Here..."  I petted him.  "My brother will end up missing you very often.  You've been a good horse to him."  The horse neighed a bit.  "Bye, Stan."  I turned away.

*Jesus, this is really real.*

I approached the tool shed, entered inside and took a look.  *Pops' old tools...  Ha, I remember him hammering away sometimes.  Nostalgia...*  I look at that corner and knew I had realized something in 2000s.

I heard a vehicle travel down the gravel road.  The sound was remarkably distinct, even after all these years.  Living on a farm with horses, peacocks, and knowing how gravel roads sounded...  These don't escape you.  I peer outside, and see a truck kicking up gravel, and ducked back inside quickly.

*I think this is it.*  I grabbed the note, folded it, and placed it into an envelope, and closed the seal.  I wrote down my name to be sure that it was addressed properly.

*Schiesse!*  I turned off the lights in the tool shed, and hid in the corner.  Maybe that's what attracted Pops in the first place.

Indistinct talking.  It sounded like a young boy and an older man talking.  That boyish voice...  I knew that voice.  I couldn't breathe too well because this is all coming too fast.  Plus, I knew this damned tool shed was so stuffy full of dust.  I also had tears streaming down my cheek, knowing what I did in 1994 and not having the power to end it.

The soft sound of footsteps, mixed with shuffling, grew louder.  I stood quietly in the dark like a mouse.  The door was left open and the man stepped inside.  He turned on the lights, and approached his tool shed, sitting down.
