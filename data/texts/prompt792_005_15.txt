"Mr. Carnel, I have tried to be patient with you. You have been rotting in this room for 3 months and nobody is going to come and rescue you. I admire your fortitude but as you can see it has all been for NOTHING!"

My panting has become weaker, a low wheeze with each breath I take. I can hear the broken chandelier swaying back and forth above me, making the same unbearable creaking noise that has never subsided since I was thrown into this god-forsaken room so many months ago. I could feel the cool wet flow of my blood falling from the top of my head down my nose, dripping onto the floor. The man is towering over me with a lead pipe in his left hand, clearly looking agitated.

"Do you think that you're being some kind of hero right now?" He threw the pipe to the side of the room and threw his hands up in the air, probably from exhaustion. "You are sacrificing yourself for three brats who don't even care about you! Who can blame them honestly though. They saw you kill their mother right before their very eyes. I'm actually quite surprised they didn't kill you on the spot!" I winced at the thought of that memory. I knew they wouldn't understand, they were only children. It doesn't help at all however knowing that my actions caused my kids to work for Blackwater. If only they would have let me explain...

"Your kids hate you and don't want anything to do with you. So... why... WON'T... YOU... TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE GOD DAMMIT!"

&#x200B;

He lifted his right arm and hit me right in the temple. The world started spinning and all I could hear was a loud rumbling and ringing in my ear. Everything started to turn black and I couldn't keep my head up anymore.

&#x200B;

BZZZZZZZT!

&#x200B;

"WAKE THE FUCK UP! I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET!"

&#x200B;

I screamed in pain as I could feel the electricity coursing through my entire body, starting from the metal surrounding my wrists and quickly coursing up my arm and to my head, and down to my waist and my feet. The pain. Oh my God the pain. Vomit projected onto the man's legs and he yelled in disgust, "LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!" He sighed and crossed his arms, "this is all your doing. You ruined your children's lives, and you have ruined your own life. Because of what you have done, you will never see the sun ever again. When we finally find your children, I will make them watch the life being sucked right out of you. Oh I hope they beg for your life. You have no idea how much joy that would bring me. I can only imagine the look on their faces when they see the lifeless look in your eyes oh it will be splendid! Once I'm done with you, I'm sure your children and I will become very.... Close."

&#x200B;

I could feel the electricity coursing through my veins again. I could no longer scream, it felt like my voice was trapped inside of my throat, my eyes were about to rupture. All I could hear was him laughing in the background, but soon even that faded into nothing. 

&#x200B;

Everything went black.

FWACK!

FWACK!

I jolted awake. How long have I been out? I was alone in the room, the sound of the chandelier still penetrating my ear drums. What was that noise?

&#x200B;

BOOM!

The door disintegrated in front of my eyes, the light shining through the doorway stung my eyes. I could barely make out three dark figures entering into the room. Who are these people? Did the last man give up and these are his replacements?

&#x200B;

I squinted my eyes to try to see their faces but the light was so painful I couldn't make anything out. Then, I heard a voice I never thought I would hear again.

&#x200B;

"Dad? We're getting you out."
