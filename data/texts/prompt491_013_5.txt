*With apologies to Terry Pratchett*

Christina wiped crimson juice from her mouth and cheeks, spreading it across the back of her hand in a long, pale stain. This was wrong, she knew, but a girl had to eat something. Even one less mouth to feed by the time she got her foraged bounty back to the others could make all the difference. Many adults were already nearly starving themselves just to make sure the few children had enough to eat.

She popped one last guilty raspberry in her mouth, savoring its sweet, warm squish between her teeth. What fun was going gathering if she couldn't take a few for herself? She gathered her basket and set off, leaving the unripe bush-bound berries for another day.

Christina had been this way many times in the two months since leaving what remained of civilization with her newfound comrades – they were a tribe now, she supposed – and already her steps had worn a light path through the undergrowth. Almost like a game trail, she thought with an ironic twist, recalling her youth spent hunting deer with her older brother. He had been away on vacation the day of the War, she thought for the hundredth time. He hadn't been in the city, so maybe...

Another bush presented itself – blueberries. She pushed the longing thoughts from her head and set about filling her half-empty basket.

HELLO, CHRISTINA, came a voice from behind her like the slam of a 5-inch-thick fallout shelter blast door. She started, her flailing arm upending the basket and scattering berries everywhere.

LOOK, I REALLY HATE TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I COULD RATHER USE YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.

Christina turned slowly, hand clasping the scavenged butcher's knife at her belt, not knowing what to expect. It still defied all her expectations.

Before her stood a black-robed figure, at least seven feet tall, leaning anxiously on a farmer's scythe. She could not see its face beneath the deep folds of the cloak's hood, but it seemed...hollow, empty. Its left hand, clutching the shaft of the scythe, was bare bone.

She drew her knife, holding it in both hands between herself and the figure like a vampire hunter's cross. “What – who are you?”

DO YOU NOT RECOGNIZE ME, CHILD?

Christina felt a horrible pang of realization. “Am...am I dead?” she asked, fearing she knew the answer.

To her surprise, Death lifted its right hand, shaking back its voluminous sleeve to reveal a skeletal wrist encrusted with watches of all styles and sizes – gold, silver, digital, analog, even a child's cartoon-adorned band. Death tapped on one that looked exactly like a gift from Christina's brother back when she graduated from high school.

NOT JUST YET. WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOU TO LISTEN.

Christina broke down and collapsed to her knees, dropping the knife. It sank point-first into the ground, just missing Death's left big toe. Death stepped back, not so much worried about its podiatric wellbeing as it was unsure how to respond to Christina's outpouring of emotion.

Death turned its head back and forth, as though checking for witnesses. LOOK, I'M NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP THIS EARLY. IT'S MEANT TO BE A DONE DEAL BY THE TIME I GET INVOLVED, SO...COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND PRETEND IT'S ALREADY OVER?

Christina sniffled, sobering slightly at the absurdity. “What's even the point? What could I possibly do to help you – and why would I?”

WELL – YOU SEE, THIS WHOLE APOCALYPSE BUSINESS HAS BEEN TERRIBLY INCONVENIENT. I NEVER EXPECTED IT TO BE THIS BAD. GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR IN A DAY? YOU HUMANS REALLY OUTDID YOURSELVES.

Death scuffed its foot on the ground uncomfortably, making a sound that put nails and chalkboards to shame. THE TRUTH IS, THERE AREN'T MANY OF YOU LEFT. I REALLY NEED YOU TO START BANDING TOGETHER AND REPOPULATING THE EARTH AND ALL, OR I'LL BE OUT OF A JOB. AND YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH OF A PAIN IT IS TO FIND ANOTHER PLANET THAT NEEDS A KEEPER OF THE AFTERLIFE...

“...Well I'm as good as dead, apparently, so I'm not sure where this is going.”

AH. AS IT HAPPENS, THERE'S ANOTHER TRIBE CAMPED A FEW MILES EAST OF HERE. I THINK YOU ALL WOULD COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER QUITE WELL. WHEN YOUR FRIEND “MIKE” COMES AND FINDS YOU IN YOUR TRAGIC LAST MOMENTS, WOULD YOU MIND TELLING HIM FOR ME?

Just then, Christina felt a sharp pain in her foot. RIGHT ON CUE. I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT. Death shifted its head in a weird motion that made her think it had tried to wink, but there was no way to know. It faded into the shadows of the trees. Christina grabbed the cottonmouth sunk fang-deep in her ankle and flung it away.

She heard someone coming along her game trail. “Michael?” she called. Of course it was him.

“Chris?!” he called back. “Where are you? Are you hurt?”

“Oh god, Michael. I'm over here.” Michael broke into a run, crashing through the bushes and into her clearing. He knelt beside her, saw the twin puncture wounds, and stared at her with knowing grief.

“Chris--”

“Shh. Just listen. You need to take them east.” Christina felt her consciousness fading. “Don't ask me why, just do it. Everything will be alright...” She trailed off and passed out. Michael caught her and lifted her over his shoulders, hoping he could get back to camp in time to do...something.

He paused, gazing east and considering her strange advice. It would be farther into the wilderness, away from most supplies and their camp at the edge of the woods. But somehow she'd seemed so certain.

As he hurried back to camp, Michael was sure he heard a grinding, grating noise, like two skeletal hands being rubbed together in anticipation.

THANK YOU, CHRISTINA.
