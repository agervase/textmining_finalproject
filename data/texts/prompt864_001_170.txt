When I was a child I idolized him. And only when I began to enter adulthood did I really see how much of a monster he was. His insatiable greed which drove his every decision, not to mention his childish recklessness and sick mind games. He was no better than those four children he so pretentiously derided as they were tortured (or "Punished" as he considered it.)

When I won the chocolate factory I was so excited, we both were. But for different reasons. Running a chocolate factory wasn't enough for him. It was necessary of course, as a reliable source of funding. But he wanted *more*. I was left to run the factory while he used the money to take advantage of the less fortunate. I should have known from that first day in the factory that he was a conman.

By the time I had arranged the appropriate legal avenues to have him ejected from *my* chocolate factory it was too late. He had amassed too much power, had too many devoted followers. Who knew a man that was practically a shut in could be so charismatic. But then again I myself had fallen for his charms as a child.

I read the article. "William "Willy" Wonka succumbed to the bullet wounds he received in yesterday's confrontation with Cult Leader Joseph "Joe" Bucket." On his deathbed he expressed his biggest regrets for allowing chocolatier Charlie Bucket to name his grandfather Joseph as his proxy until he reached the age of majority. The confrontation arose when William refused to provide any more prototype "Life Extender Licorice" to the 120 year old man when his supply had been exhausted. Joseph suffered a heart attack after firing the pistol and was dead when the paramedics arrived on the scene."

I fold the newspaper and begin arrangements for the burial of my last family member. He will be entombed in the family crypt alongside my other three grandparents. But unlike them I think I might leave his coffin upright. That bastard lied in bed long enough.
