Damn this is some strong acid I thought. I sat back down on the couch and looked at the spot on the wall were my flatscreen was. I was tripping mad balls because it was just cause i have white walls and a white image flashed on the screen at the same time. Anyways i was hungry so i grabbed a bag of m&m's off the coffee table and started gobling them up, they were super tasty and before i knew it i just had 1 blue m&m left. It was like torture how had i ate them all alreadyðŸ˜© this last eminem was all the sweets i had in the whole house. Wtf? Another mouse? Wtf no dont click my m&m! I watched in horror as seemingly in slow motion the mouse slowly slid down to delete **Poof** i stared at the palm of my hand were my last piece of chocolate used to be in dismay.. that was real.. i saw it that time it wasnt the drugs. My eminem is GONE i have no more sweets anywhere ðŸ˜­my mouth is so salty i needed that m&m i was freaking out cause somthing actually just deleted my candy. I looked up and my tv wasnt even there anymore like i first thought it actually was gone! After it disappeared i must have just imagined a comercial playing in the space were my tv used to be because of the drugs, that was so crazy i only saw it there for a second cause i looked away but i swear for like 3 seconds in the space on my wall were my tv was i saw a farm and fleet commecial playing, it was soo vivid. I stared again in dismay at my wall this time stunned that my HD tv was actually missing. I was scared. What was happening? Am i inside a computer i thought? I was afraid at any moment my arms or legs would start to dissappear or that the ground and my couch and house and everything would disappeare and i would fall into a dark black abyss of emptiness forever. As i sat on my couch trying to keep myself together while the acid actually started to kick in i heard a feminine computer voice, "WINDOWS 10 UPDATE INSTALLING" suddenly a big blue box flew infront of my with the widows logo and a progress bar on it. It read "updates installing, will power off and install when completed". I looked around my living room but the big blue box stayed right in the center of my vision everytime i turned my head i was so frustrating. I could see only out my periferal vision and it was all blurry, but i started seeing everything around my living room start to dissappear as the progress bar proceeded to to 100% mark. It was currently at 52 and picking up speed. I watched as all my prized possessions around my house dissapeared until suddenly i couldnt see anything. Wait a minute, i looked up and my house was rising above me suoer fast and it was surrounded by pitch black, i looked all around me in all directions and it was pitch black. I had to look up sort of diagonally to see my house to see it through my peripheral vision, and it was rapidly shrinking. I realized I was falling, falling into a deep dark abyss of nothingness just as i had feared. I looked down at my arms and I noticed my fingertips dissappearing, the progressbar read "97%". I was completely horrified as i slowly watched my arms and legs dissappear, my worst fear was happening and i couldnt do anything to stop it. Right as the rest of my chest dissappeared the bar filled up completely to 100%. The blue box now said "shutting down" seconds later i saw big white letters appear suddenly in the middle of the black emptyness
