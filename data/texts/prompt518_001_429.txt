I wasn't expecting it. You never do, really. But I guess I was hoping he'd make it.

My best friend had gone missing a few days earlier. I figured something awful had happened on his morning run in the forest behind the suburb we both lived in. Nobody had seen anything, and there was no sign of him.

I couldn't bear the thought of not finding him. My wife passed away years ago, and with no children or other real family, he was all I had left.

And then I felt it. The rush, the dizziness, and the sudden appearance somewhere new. A cave in the side of a hill, and he was lying there, bleeding. Something had attacked him, clearly. He was weak, shivering. But he looked at me and smiled.

I knew he wasn't going to make it. He must have known too. There's no way I could have gotten him back to a doctor in time. We knew that the timer couldn't be beaten like that. But he looked resigned to his death, and smiled just because he knew I was there for him. I guess we both just realized that all we could do was spend one last hour together.

I sat down next to him, holding him. He was shivering, and could barely move. I cried as I held him, telling him stories of all the good times we'd had together. Telling him how much he meant to me, how much I'd miss him. I didn't know how I could go on without him in my life.

He couldn't speak, but I think I could see him smile, just being close to me. There wasn't anything we could do to stop it, but we could at least be there for eachother at the end. 

As the timer reached it's end, I held him tighter. I didn't want to let go, I didn't want to accept it. But I had to.

And as he breathed his last breath, I whispered into his ear, "Good boy, Rex. Good boy."
