As I looked up from the door at a horizon blue and white. A cheer erupted all around me, a cheer of humans. My vision cleared a little bit more to reveal a sea of smiling faces. "He's Awake" they chanted in unision, as far as the eye could see they gathered in crowds under a blue martian sun, waiting for me. 

   An old man in robes broke away from the crowd and took my arm as I lapsed, still weak from my sleep. "sit my friend, you've had a long sleep" My hand slid across my brow and over my eyes, I rubbed them, The man's hand on my back like a revelation. So long nothing, no human company, no voices, no contact. And now.. I burst into tears, uncontrollable and convulsive. And with me a crowd of thousands of people gasped in sadness, connected to me the empathy was tremendous. More than I could bear and I staggered back into my broken ship. 

   The old mans robes wisped behind me as he followed me back inside. He said in a sympathetic tone "Sleep traveler, take as long as you need. But know you were the first and you are honored. There's much to tell you of the fate of Earth and the migration here, but you were the first, and you've been sleeping for more than a thousand years, we never knew how to wake you so this place became a shrine, always tended and monitored for your waking."

   I looked back towards the door from my seat on my bed, a sea of faces tried all at once to peek into the door from miles away on the hills and all around. The grounds close to the door were green and tended, as if they had been a garden for centuries. "This place is yours my friend" The white haired man with the blue eyes continued. "Take as long as you like, gather yourself and come out to greet your people. I have much to tell you. "
   With a smile and a wink, he closed the door behind him with a click.
