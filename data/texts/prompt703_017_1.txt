You glare at Jonathan, even as Death continues to explain the rules. Food and Drink will be made available, and you won't need to sleep or use the bathroom for the duration. Finally, Death seems like he's finished talking and you let the silence stretch.

"Fucker." Is the first word that comes out, but it's hardly your last. "Why did you have to pick me? You're married right? Shouldn't Helen be here? Or one of your siblings, or someone from your Frat? Why bother involving me at all? I'm an atheist!"

"I don't think their existence relies on your belief, Dave." He replies with his usual dry wit. You've missed hearing it, missed the late night talks that covered every aspect of philosophy and life. He continues onwards. "But back to your earlier question, you are actually the only person I could call on. It's not like we taught anyone else to play Equilibria after all."

Your mind catches on what he just said. "How'd you swing that one? From what I remember Equilibria was a theoretical discussion we had during Logic Class, not a game to challenge Death with."

He shrugs. "The idea stuck with me, and my grandfather ended up building a physical set in his workshop his last Christmas. Real enough to count, but it's still a four person game and I needed someone who knew the rules. I kinda want to win this thing, you know."

You stare for a moment before snorting. "No you don't. And there's other solved games out there. Why not just challenge tic tac toe and be done with it?"

"Officially draws count as losses, but..."

"but Equilibria doesn't draw, it just continues. I guess it keeps you out of hell, at least."

"Hey. Me, You, a Boardgame, drinks, and conversation is close enough to heaven. And besides, they might give up eventually."

"The personification of Death, getting bored? Or Satan giving up a soul?"

"It could happen! I just never said it was likely."

"About as likely as you taking a dick up your ass, I'd say. Now how about we pick colors and get started?
