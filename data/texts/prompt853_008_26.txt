Richard didn't have much, he had hopped that whatever came after would be a relief to all his troubles, but now that he was here, he just looked at a small wad of twenties and a stack of change. It was only a little more money than he was used to, but it was still not a lot.

He sat in a room painfully like the one he just left minus the mess. Looking at two boxes on the table. One to donate and one to move on. He was aware of what they were for, the moment he got here he knew, he couldn't explain it.

The cash, was just a representation of his value in the form of what he coveted most. What he had so little of for most of his poor and miserable life. To see he had so little still, to spend on something good to go to hurt. He figured it wouldn't have been much better than hell if he spent every penny he had to improve his afterlife, not that hell could top his actual life. He had tried to be a better person, but it was really, REALLY hard in his circumstances.

So, like his many acts of charity that had kept him constantly poor his entire life, he had given away what he cherished most to someone who needed it more. Every twenty, every dollar, every quarter, dime, nickel and penny went into the donation box. It wasn't much, but he hoped that it gave someone the much needed boost to improve their chances. To not be as sad, and lonely as he had been his entire life.

He was suddenly tired, so he went to this afterlife version of his bed and went back to sleep. A sleep, that again, he didn't expect to wake up from.

Ricky opened her eyes for the first time in her father's arms. The man smiled the brightest smile she'd ever seen. Her other dad poked his head over his shoulder.

"Hello there! Are you happy to see your new daddies?"

Ricky smiled, it was a new start with a similar beginning, but this time, she was wanted and loved.
