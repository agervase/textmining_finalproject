**2018: The Game**

*****

I raised my M4A1 service rifle, pointing the barrel at the zombie twenty yards away.

“Almost got him.” I aimed carefully from my position, sprawled lengthwise behind a bush that provided the only cover in this godforsaken state.

Illinois was flatter than a goddamn landscape painting, but I had to get my grandson to Chicago. After all, that’s where the President was. If I knew anything about this country, it’s that the elite weren’t going to leave their former commander-in-chief hanging out to dry.

Suddenly, everything went white.

I began to curse but caught myself. I blinked rapidly. Grey blurs became shapes and colors once again.

When my vision returned, I saw the source of the explosion. In the yellow clearing where the zombie had stood, smoke rose from the wreckage of a mechanical bloodhound and the now limp carcass of the undead.

I quickly jumped to my feet and began to run away. I wasn’t sure whether the target had been robot or zombie, but there was only one thing that could take both out with one shot.

*Whrrrrr.*

The photon cannon of the mothership behind me began to recharge. I didn’t want to turn around to see if it was aiming at me.

“This game is awesome!” I turned to look at my grandson beside me, a slightly bored expression on his face.

“You get to battle against all three of the invasions - zombies, robots, aliens. How cool is that?”

Sid squinted at the screen with an almost pained expression.

“Yea- it’s cool grandpa. I’ll definitely try it soon.”

And with that, he turned back towards the smaller screen in his lap.

I sighed. When I was growing up, I had to learn history from textbooks or, for a brief period, television before the "conspiracy shows" took over. What I wouldn’t have given to play a fun, educational game like this one.

“Well,” I tossed my controller aside. “You better head back off to your pod.”

“Alright, grandpa,” he said, unplugging his controller, and scampered off.

I shook my head. Kids these days didn’t know how lucky they were.

That’s why I'd commissioned the game in the first place: to teach the next generation about what it had been like to grow up during what seemed at the time like the apocalypse - to traverse the former United States to safe havens like Chicago where the Foundation would provide refuge to those fleeing from the Boston Dynamics robots that went out of control or the epidemic that rotted the flesh of its barely-living victims.

How wise the Foundation had been to plan ahead. And of course, I had been very lucky. I hadn’t had to flee from the lasers of the *Scchari* vessels. My parents' work at the *Boring Company* had been enough to secure us a spot in one of the bunkers in Chicago.

This was my chance to give back. With funding from the Zuckerberg-Chan-Musk-Bezos-Obama-Trump Foundation, I had the opportunity to build my own contribution to our incredible society:
