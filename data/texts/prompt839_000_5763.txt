Clement shuffled in his chair, bones creaking with every movement. Face tense and focused, Clement held his piece between his thumb and forefinger, eying the state of the game board. 

He moved his Knight forward, opening up a discovery check from his bishop. Death was left with only one option. 

Death slid his King into a corner, knowing full well what was coming next. 

Clement moved his idle rook forward from his opened backlines, across the board in one fell swoop. 

"I believe that's Checkmate," he said, the tension draining from his face. He leaned back into his seat, a wry smile spreading on his thin lips. "So, now what?

Death was at a loss for words. The skeletal figure remained fixated on the board, unwavering, eerily silent. Clement let the entity stew for a moment; the last thing he wanted to do was incur the ire of Death itself. 

It was a long time until Death spoke, his voice low and gravelly, ostensibly no louder than a whisper, but one that carried in the wind, echoed in the silence. "Well, this is... *unprecedented*." Clement felt a chill run down his spine. 

Death's skeletal fingers traced the edge of the chessboard, the carved wood beginning to age and wither, crumpling into barely visible remains. And even those disappeared when Death let go, leaving nothing but an empty table. 

"Do you want some time to think?" Clement asked, keeping his voice soft. The entity was as old as time itself, but, even then, he bore the mannerisms of a child; he'd basked in each piece he'd stolen from Clement, fumed at every loss. 

Perhaps it was perverse, but Clement felt an odd responsibility for him. Who knew what would happen if the arbiter of passing were to lose his temper? 

"There's no thinking to be done!" Death sat up, wisps of shadowy tendrils curling out from under his cloak. "*You* - you should've lost, old man!" He raised an accusatory finger, which Clement lightly pushed away. 

The old man smiled, the creases on his face protruding as he met the entity's eyes - or, rather, eye *sockets.* "We all lose eventually; that's just life."  

"I'm *Death*, I don't lose." 

Clement didn't speak. Instead, he just diverted his gaze to the table between them, arching a brow. 

"As I said, this is unprecedented. You're just a mere mortal; Fischer, Tal, Botvinnik - I've beaten all your champions. *Each and every one of them.* The moment you sat down, destiny should've dictated your loss. The deck was stacked, the game rigged." 

Clement chuckled wheezily, hitting his chest to gather himself once the laugh became a violent cough. "I'm used to that. We all are." 

"*We?*"

"Everyone." 

"Are you trying to be smart, old man?" 

"No, not at all. What you just said, though. It's true, all of it. I'm just a man - bloody old, at that. I played chess once or twice with my grandson, and he made a fool of me both times. I had a big family, you know? All the way to great-grandkids. Imagine that! *Great* grandchildren. And yet, all that, all those faces, all of them, they're just a blink in time's eye. It's sobering to think."  

Death paused, the tendrils around him pulsating, a silent threat. He didn't talk. For once, he listened. 

Clement continued. "But it's not easy. Living. To care long enough to see your family through for so long. At some point, most people my age just get jaded. They cease to care; the aches become too sharp, the nights too sleepless, the children too loud. Fact is, you can have it all, and, even then, life will make a loser of you. Somehow. I guess what I'm trying to say is, God, man, genius, we all have the same weakness: life itself." 

Clement smiled bitterly, his eyes sparkling as he looked up to Death once more. 

"Are you implying that I'm discontent, mortal?" 

Clement simply tapped his nose. "All I'm saying is, play me again and you'll find out. Don't hold back now. A life is only worth living at its fullest." 

-----

Death flicked Clement's King off of the board, watching it tumble to the ground. He'd won in two moves. *Two moves.* A fool's mate; the most simple blunder in Chess to avoid, tantamount to knowing not to put a fork in a toaster. 

And the damn man was grinning. 

Worst of all, Death felt hollow. The victory gave him no pleasure, if anything, Clement seemed happier than ever. 

"Why are you smiling, old man?! You just forfeited your soul with that blunder." 

"I know!" Clement laughed, slapping his knee. "But, really, does that make you happy? Come now, be honest with me, Death."

Death flinched. Nobody spoke to him in such a direct manner. 

"If I'm to be rid of your vacuous philosophy, then, yes, I'm happy. You're worse than Nietzsche. Man constantly tried to deny my existence." 

Clement's smile dropped some, although it didn't quite fade. "I see. Well, hopefully you learnt a thing or two then. I suppose I'll be off. How does this work, do you -?"

Death extended his hand, a black scythe materialising in his grip, the curved tip running along Clement's neck. 

"Oh..." 

"Just one slice, and it'll all be over. You'll feel *nothing.* No pain, no sensation. Just *nothing.*" 

"Scary," Clement muttered dryly. 

"You don't sound scared." 

"Mhm." 

Death looked down at the chessboard, keeping his weapon fixed at Clement's throat. The first game between them *had* been fun. It was almost a shame to have to see the man off. 

He lowered his scythe. 

"We're one for one, yes?" 

Clement nodded. 

"Sit down, old man. Best of three. I want to see if you can replicate your first fluke." 

"Very well, but you'll have to promise me something!"

Death turned his head. "*What* would you dare demand of me?" 

"Clement. My name's Clement." The old man extended a hand. "I'm afraid I'm not particularly good at chess, so you'll have to excuse my blunders." 

After a brief hesitation, Death took his hand, shaking it firmly. "You know who I am."

"All too well." 

Together, they sat down and played. 

The man was right, Death had been discontent. Eons had made a monster of him. Sure, he'd indulged in finding new ways to torment and massacre the mortals he shepherded but, ultimately, it'd been for nothing. 

Winning wasn't fun. His ever-life as guardian of the damned brought him no joy. 

*This* was fun. 

Having an opponent. 

Having a meaning, one to keep.  

Death sacrificed his Queen, and let the man win again.
