Ch: 1

“This is the third one this week! How do they end up like this anyway?” Detective Parker, surveyed the scene quietly as his partner Briggs pointed out the obvious. A middle aged, caucasian male was found dead this morning by maintenance staff on the roof of an apartment building downtown."I.D. says his name was Arthur Shlank,
lives all the way on the West Side."

“He looks like a smart enough fella, gotta wonder if there was anything else involved. Why would anybody like this be up here in the first place?” Asked Briggs, looking down the fire escape. The man was found strangled by his own neck tie, which had been caught in the access door to the roof. It eerily reminded Parker of the time when he was twelve and came home to see his dog Barney hung by his own collar on the picket fence. The only items found on the body were a pen, a blank notebook, a train ticket and $6.37.

On the street crowds had just begun to form at the entrance of the building. It wouldn’t be long before the news vans showed up expecting an answer. Across the street a bell rang sounding the beginning of the work day and the Special Services Bureau emptied onto the sidewalk. After a moment Parker replied,”I’m not sure, but there are a helluva lot of blondies down there now, we need to secure this scene for the coroner.”

There was no nice way to put it, people were showing up dead like this all over town. Briggs mentioned it being the third this week but it seems like ever since we found that girl inside the water treatment plant last month, bodies keep appearing where they shouldn’t. How did she even get access to the building not to mention that particular room? Parker thought to himself as he rolled the police tape across the stairwell. What is going on here?
