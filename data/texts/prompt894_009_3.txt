Joey" two cannoli" Tofutti had worked a lot of markets to make the monthly vig to the Capo for the Boss, burying cars for insurance, the assorted dealings in drug and gun running, prostitution rings and the old standby, running the numbers game. It was Marie Contessa his bag woman for the gambling receipts who clued him in to the tween snap band market. "it's fuckin' huge Joey hell the resell on it is worth the work - look at fuckin' Ebay hey." The edge on the vig was there but with two Federal priors and a current investigation to the pokemon extortion racket he couldn't risk jacking a semi rig full of them, better to milk a secondary market lower risk and steady stream of income would be the ideal but nothing prepared him for the work ahead.Joey "two Cannoli" Tofutti had never had girls in his family and no clue at the possibilities of disorganization and chaos to be found in their rooms. To a guy who sinks .22 bullets into skulls as an aspect of work a certain organizing principle has to be attained or you will sink your own ship, you want to dig the ditch for the other guy not your own and nothing said doom to organization in a room like a girl getting hormones built up in her day by dizzying day. Cold February had rolled in, the Patriots upset his spread on the game and now things were on edge for in 23 days the Vig was due and Joey Tofutti, fan of all things cannoli was on the hook for it to Tito "clean hits" Garofalo. Animal print slap bracelets, Hanmei basic black hair bands and the ever popular Snappee Extra Soft Hairbands were piled deep in the recesses of millions of rooms across the country, a slow motion super fund site of processed oil waiting for plunder.
