These 60 second, they are my chance. A chance to leave the lonely life I live. A chance to find the one. There is still the little girl in me who dreams about my soulmate being a price of some exotic island, who will wisk me away the moment he finds me. The past years, the only thing keeping me alive was him. I had seen glimpses of his life, the friends, the beach, the glasses, oooh, and his dreamy forearms. I wonder what he has seen of my life, a bare wall, a razor, tears, maybe a couple of strangers walking past me on my way to work. I wonder if he wants me as much as I want him, was my life too sad? Had I scared him away already?

I grab my backpack and get off the bus, trying my hardest to not make eye contact with the weary people watching me leave.     I am just about to step off, and I see half of my vision shift to a different view. I stumble to the bus stop bench and take a seat, still a little taken aback by the suddenness of the Vision. I close my eyes to focus. 

He is on a bus it seems. That is very unlike him as he owns a car. There is an empty seat, diagnal to him. For some reason, he can't take his eyes off of it. Please, I want to find you, give me some thing to work with. It is morning right now, for the both of us. That narrows it down...to like a bajillion people. He looks at his phone, not turning it on, but instead playing with the wire of his earphones. Hurry up, I only got 60 seconds with you, do something. Slowly, his gets up and moves to the still empty seat. As he approches the seat, I finally realize what he was staring at. A small black mirror. No, a phone. No, my phone.
