It had been a normal day in the cafeteria so far, if by anyone's definition of normal included one inmate getting his ear bitten off and half digested by another.  My fellow officers and I had been escorting him to isolation while others were trying to pacify the crowd as medic worked to stop the bleeding.  Our inmate is one of the special cases, and before the budget cuts, afforded a room of his own.  Now, they have him in gen pop.  Great experiment, there.  He attacked an arsonist for calling him crazy.

Then the world switched over like I'd flipped a television channel. The first thing that hit me was how quiet it was.  The second was that my feet were dangling from the bench seat I was sitting in.  I look down at my arms and am surprised by how small they are.  I quickly take in my surroundings, the other children sitting next to me on the bus, the same shocked faces and squeaky voices.  And the teacher who has stood up in the front of the bus.  

In training, the instructors drilled into us the need to watch for inmates who were threats and separate them before they could cause trouble.  Across the aisle a small boy and I lock eyes, and I immediately recognize the way he and I are evaluating the others.  "Are you Corrections?". He nods, " yeah, Woden.  You were in the hall with me?" "Yes, I'm Reynolds, we had that biter in cuffs and were taking him down to", I break off as I realize that the others around us aren't just strangers.  

Woden's seen the same thing and is looking at the teacher.  She has this look in her eyes.  She's also clearly agitated and would be a candidate for a psych eval, had we still been on the inside.   Too bad I'm no longer able to restrain anyone above three feet tall.  Woden turns to me, "We need to get out of here, now", and walks to the back of the bus.  

"Leaving so soon?  Why, schools in session, children, and I'm going to teach all of you what happens when you call me crazy".
