"Of course I can see you Lilly" I reply, certain of how events will unfold next. "You're the one who hasn't noticed me. I've been riding this bus with you for the past six months, hoping to catch your glance".

She gives me a grim look, but says nothing. I believe she's starting to recognize me, or at least realize who I am.

I can't blame her for not noticing me, you could say that I've changed. I've been known to dress mainly in dark colors, my rolled up sleeves revealing my fully tattooed arms. Black boots, that sort of thing. I probably looked like some overgrown edgy teenager, but I felt badass.

Those days are behind me though, I look more like your regular thirty-something, moderately successful businesswoman.

"I'm sorry, I got lost in my thoughts" I say with a smile as I turn my eyes away from the window back to her face. Contrary to popular opinion, I'm a very polite person, and my temper is always in check. I don't like ill mannered people, and I do my very best to not be one.

"You've had your time to reflect on things Lilly. I won't claim to know why you chose to ride on this bus these couple of months, but I have to thank you. It's been a nice change from my regular means of transportation."

As I pause, I can see she now understands fully who I am.

"I believe this is your stop. I hope you're prepared". I extend my hand, and all she says is "I'm ready", as she takes my hand.

When we hop off, we start walking slowly down the street, as the scenery begins to slowly change. She's still holding my hand, not because I offered it before, but because she needs it, at least for now.

People say that I'm bad, evil even. But let me ask you. Would God allow people to stay a bit longer before taking them? I know him, and believe me, he wouldn't.
