The light of the inferno could not overpower the sheer dark present this day. An ominous figure floated over the tendrils of the conflagration, which could only retract as his pure black mist engulfed them. Before him lay the waste of a war won, and a war lost. Not a solitary soul was visible, but then he wouldn't be here if there was.

*My brother has had a field day here.*

He continued on his melancholy journey to its tragic end. Distress and grief in the air betrayed the hiding spot of a girl, her tears providing enough deterrence against the hellscape surrounding her. In her grasp were the hands of two others, already led far away by the Grim Reaper.

*Can you see me, child?*

She looked up. To lay eyes upon his aura is the final condemnation. His presence was no mistake. In her mind he could feel her confuse him for his brother. 

*I do not deal in false deaths, my child. You lay before the True Reaper more dead than any corpse in this village. Traders have crossed their paths; their faces are registered in the minds of the living. No living soul has or will ever cross your path.*

Perhaps he shouldn't have been so blunt. The girl's fear and grief and sorrow emanated suddenly as a violent force which took him by surprise, and knocked him back a few inches. It was enough to destroy an empath weaker than he. Within her mind was a singularity of pain he'd not witnessed since God cast Lucifer down to hell. This girl had a mind of raw ability, and it was all put to a single use: rebellion. What a shame the fate which befell what could perhaps be the most powerful mortal mind to grace this Earth.

But he must continue. He fought the waves of emotion, his omniscience suddenly his greatest weakness. Reaching out his hand, he attempted to touch her, but the tips of his fingers burnt to ash. With all her might, she cast a powerful wave and reversed all his progress. He could not give up. He directed his own empathetic wave, but he was completely locked out. 

Exhausting all his other options, he touched one of the corpses as she clutched them. Memories and emotions flowed through him and, for a moment, revealed a weakness before the girl. Taking full advantage, she emitted a blast which knocked him far from her.

Soft music filled the air of the village. The flames extinguished completely, and darkness overtook the village for a moment. From the corpses in the girl's grasp flew sparkling luminescence. Floating through the air, they surrounded the girl's destroyed home. She weakened her assault and gazed around her. The music grew louder. The scent of charred corpses was replaced by soothing lavender. Swathes of joyful emotion overtook her and she ceased her attack entirely. The bright dust formed into new beams of wood and new smiling people, as the music grew louder. Suddenly the girl was surrounded by her old life.

The illusion would not last. The True Reaper rushed to the girl, and touched her forehead. The jubilation rushing through her would do so for eternity as her temporal mind shut down. 

As the figure stood and prepared to depart from this scene of calamity, he turned and found himself face to face with his brother. 

*You are cruel to leave her here. You knew if you did I would arrive here first.*

*Am I, older brother? Tell me, if I'd taken her with her parents, what emotions would engulf her for eternity? I've seen countless die torturous, pointless deaths only for them to feel their pain forever. Before me today lied someone with the potential for you to meet her first.*

The Grim Reaper approached her, and touched her arm as her heart beat its last. From her emerged a spirit as luminous as the Sun. Her wide, bright, tearful eyes looked to the True Reaper as her hand held the Grim's. "Thank you," she mouthed, as the two of them ascended to heaven. 

Alone floated the True Reaper in this wasteland of expired hopes and dreams. There was no more light to touch this village. In deep introspection, he was too distracted to feel the summon of his next journey.
