"Noel, mom!" I said.

"Who's that?" My mom, a single mother has been cracking mom jokes all our lives, to lighten up the mood for three of us. 

We both laughed a very forceful laugh.

"Mom, seriously though, isn't that an absurd concept ?"

"I guess it is, imagine spending your whole life thinking Someone is real, just to realise they aren't."

My mom picked up our plates, leaving Noel's plate where it is and I find that quite weird. 

My mother comes back, " you know as a child you often spoke to yourself, I always ignored it thinking you're just a kid, what's the worst that could happen" 

"I never spoke to myself I spoke to Noel" I turned towards him, "Noel tell her"

"He did mom" Noel said straight away but my mother kept her gaze fixed at me.

Why did she not react to what he just said ? 

I feel a chill in the room, like someone literally put the heat off or tuned up the air condition.

I start feeling a bit uneasy, I look at Noel - " Bro, why is she acting so weird?"

"Leon  - who you speaking to?"

"Mom this isn't funny I'm speaking to Noel " 

"Who's Noel, Leon ? Your really freaking me out now "

"Ya who's Noel, Leo ?" Noel jokes, I hit him on his arm. 

"Guys this isn't funny"

My mom's face turns pale, she genuinely looks frightened.

"Leon, I don't know why you're doing this and how you know but it's not something you joke about"

"What you talking about mom"

"When Robert and I had you, you had a twin brother. you'll were a minute apart, he didn't make it and we decided we'll name him, Noel. As a gesture we named you Leon, it's Noel spelt backwards, but why are you doing this, it's not funny" 


I froze. I was to afraid too look to my right. "Mom,
I've been speaking to Noel for the past 18 years"
