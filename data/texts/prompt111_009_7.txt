John sipped his green tea calmly. He was sitting amidst the debris, drinking his tea out of a cut-out aluminuim can. At a distance he could see large blueish ships being attacked by swarms of silver metallic birds. 

I'm too old for this, he thought. 

He finished his tea and got up to water his plants. His plants were what saved him, for if he hadn't been out to water them, the blue orb would've flattened him along with his house.

He heard the growl which he has been hearing from the past two days. It seemed like he was somehow transported into a nightmare, a bad dream. Only few days ago everything was normal. His guava tree was just about to bear fruit. The tree was no more.

He remembered how she had helped him plant the tree.

The tree was no more. 

He turned to see the robotic scout dog. The dog peered at him curiously, then scanned him with it's green laser. 

He heard footsteps. The dog sat, intently watching the old man's movements. The footsteps grew louder. Three hunks approached him, two of them wearing metallic armour. They were not living beings, but they were sentient. He could feel the case of their cameras on him, the slight whirring noise they made when trying to shift their focus. The third hunk removed his mask to reveal a very human face, for it was a human face indeed.

"We can control the robots now. It took time, but we did it. Now, we just need to take care of the Aliens. All the zombies...." he trailed off, realising he spoke too much.

The old man had lived long and seen enough pain. He nodded at him understandingly. 

"Today, we have succeeded. We all entered the battle at the same time, but we must ensure that only we're the ones remaining. Take down the aliens, and bask in the glory of the new world."

The bluish ship fell to the earth a loud crunch. Maybe it was over. Maybe this was their victory. 

It was a well deserved one at that, too.
