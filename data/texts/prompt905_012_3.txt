This is my first response, valid criticism is welcome!

I am Southern Inuit from Labrador so I decided to make one based on my heritage and how downright unfair it is to have Canadian Indigenous People in a war.

***The Canadian government has reneged on every last treaty with the indigenous peoples.***

We have decided that instead of being vocal outside the Supreme Court, we should disappear, manipulate and fight behind the scenes as much as possible until we are fully ready.

##The First Step of a cunning plan.

I used the majority of the Toronto Area population to lul them into a false sense of knowledge about our  culture, and the actors in British Columbia did an excellent job of convincing them they were hippies.

###Step Two.

It was a long and hard slog to get the people from both Newfoundland and Labrador to work together since they became two separate provinces as they are still wary of each other. 

While the diplomats were ensuring that Newfoundland wouldn't make another grab for Labrador's resources I managed to get the following provinces to start training: Yukon, Northwest Territories. Nunavut is impossible since trying to find and convince twenty five thousand Inuit is an impossibility at best without the support of their elders.

####Step Three.

You petty Americans visiting your family think that redneck uncle is dangerous, you should see the storm troops. 

Over one and a half million indiginous people, impervious to the harshest temperatures, and can make do with the little that they can afford, become awe-inspiring when given a generous budget.

####Step Four.

Training, I have no clue how they did not notice a steady diversion of supplies from the Canadian military and "*mysteriously*" disappearing before being fully decommissioned and destroyed. Some of the armor and air divisions (nearly got caught doing that one, but a convenient hangar fire conveniently blamed on the Bloc Quebecois removed all evidence)

#Attack.

The training made [our air force unstoppable](http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=6569147724)

Our infantry was [a knife in the dark](http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=879698426093)

Our command's tactics were [studied for generations to come](http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=312478119684)

Their armor [stood no chance](http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=258479613229)

Hell, even the few [elders](http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=770278724567) that joined got stuck in.


The best part of it all?

While I was doing diplomacy between the bands, we got the Indigenous Peoples from around the world to remember the horrors that their governments had committed and pissed them off so much that we didn't even need to arm their guerrilla war, as they stole arms from the dead to arm their brothers and sisters.

The hardest part was stopping the guerrilla's from war crime so that the recently defeated peoples would not have horrors like the [Residential Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system) or worse, the [Highway of Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Tears_murders).

They did not understand that Victory ends at Defeat, not losing your honor and destroying each family that had nothing to do with their plight before the War.

For that, the guilty shall be ***sorry*** to not have listened to reason and history when we were polite....
