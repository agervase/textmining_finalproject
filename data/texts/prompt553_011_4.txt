 

**30 years ago**

I woke up this morning… I don't know how, or why, but I did. 

The last thing I remember is a set of headlights driving towards me on the way home from my women's conference. I don't remember coming home last night, but I feel like death. My joints are all sore and my body is bruised. 

Bill is still asleep, he must have had a really rough night too, I don't know what we’re going to do about the van, but I guess I can drive the kids to work today in his truck. 

It’s still early, really early actually… I usually wake up around 4:30 but I suppose I must not have slept very well it’s 3:46 now. I take a nice hot shower, pick out an outfit -something to hide all these bruises- and put makeup over the discoloration around my face and neck. I kiss Bill’s forehead -not even a stir, so typical of him, he sleeps like the dead- and I head to the kitchen to start some coffee and sit down to do some morning journaling.

I grab my journal and flip to my bookmark, inside there’s a folded piece of paper. Carefully I unfold it:

*My dearest Laura,*

*I love you, you are such an amazing wife, and a great mother to our 3 children.* 

*Laura, I don’t know how to tell you this but… last night you died. Take a deep breath, I know you are very confused and scared right now, but I assure you everything is okay. Laura, in my grief I have made a decision, and if you are reading this it means that I have succeeded. I know how crazy this may sound, and how much you may disapprove, but you have to know, I can’t live without you and our children most certainly cannot. Laura, last night I performed Nicadeimis’s ritual… I know it’s strictly forbidden, but our children need their mother more than they need their father. They are still so young, and I spend so much time traveling as it is, you are all they have. Laura, I love you, and I am more than happy to give my life for yours. These past 10 years with you have been the best of my life and there is no better end to my life than this.* 

*I love you, and I always will with all my heart,*

*Bill.*

I run to our room and weep into his chest. Jesus Bill can’t you understand?!? Our children need their father, they need to know their father. Eric is starting Little League this weekend, you promised him… you promised me you would teach him how to catch. And Bella has been working so hard on her routine for her recital later this month, she just wants you to be proud of her. I cry until my eyes are sore, the letter crinkled in my hand. 

I sit up and dust myself off, he can’t die. In my mind I run through all of the steps of the ritual, is it possible? I will have to do some research today after I drop the kids off, but I think I can re-offer this life to him.

I hear little footsteps and some rustling coming from the kids' room. I spring up, dab the tears from my eyes and tuck in my husband. I lock our room behind me and head towards the kitchen.

I make my way into the kitchen and Bella gives me a big sleepy bear hug. Her hair still tousled from sleep. I kneel down and embrace her. I kiss her on the head and start to make breakfast for her and Eric. We make small talk, she askes about the conference and tells me about her crazy dream. I tell her that the van is in the shop so we get to ride in daddy’s truck to school today, she shrieks in shrill joy and scarfs down her breakfast just as her little brother is trudging his way up the stairs. 

I get the kids ready for school, all the normal things, ‘she bit me’ ‘you can’t wear stripes and polka-dots’ all that nonsense. But today I treasure every moment. I would have lost this without Bill, I was and still am pretty upset, but I am thankful. And I know that I will do everything in my power to make sure he can enjoy this too.

**Today**

I woke up today… I know why and I know how.

I kiss my husband’s forehead, We’ve lived like this: dead one day, alive the next, for the past 30 years. Every night we offer up our lives to the other and we’ve managed. It’s been difficult, but we’ve seen our children grow up to be successful, amazing people, with children of their own. 

I take a hot shower, find a nice outfit and do my makeup, I marvel at my wrinkles and my grayed hair. I shuffle to the kitchen and make some coffee. On the table, I see a dozen red roses, a box of chocolates, a bottle of wine and a card. Oh what has he done this time, I chuckle, he probably forgot to mow the lawn or file taxes of something. I open up the box of chocolates and pour myself some coffee. I sit down and open up the card:

*My dearest Laura,*

*Love of my life, you have been such a companion to me these 45 years. Together we have raised 2 beautiful children and had the chance to see our grandchildren too. Laura, I don’t know how to tell you this… but I want to die. I miss you so much. I haven’t made you laugh in 30 years, not in person anyway. I haven’t made love to you or watched a show with you in my arms. And well, when you are willing I would like to be with you again. I feel I have lived a long and prosperous life, but the one thing missing from that was you. I always wanted to travel the world with you, but we never could. I have loved you as much as any man could ever love a woman. Please don’t perform the ritual tonight, I will see you in the afterlife. I look forward to kissing you again and embracing you in my arms. Thank you for being my life partner through death.*

*Yours eternally,*

*Bill*

A soft smile came across my face and tears began to fall. Yes, I will meet you there. I shakily rose from the chair and went to dial my children, I caught up with them like I do every other Monday, I told them how much I loved them and I laughed with my grandchildren once more.

They hung up and went along their daily routines. I grabbed my bottle of codeine and dressed up in my Sunday best. I went and lay next to my husband and held him tight, I wanted so badly to be with him again. I kissed him on the forehead and swallowed the rest of the bottle. Each pill slid down easier than the last. A peace washed over me and everything went dark.

As I came to, a light washed over me, I opened my eyes and looked around the field. The breeze was warm and inviting, the grass soft under my bare feet. I began walking. He was here somewhere, on the horizon, I saw a brilliant tree, under it a figure of a man. I began running towards him. He saw me and got up and ran to me. He embraced me and we both wept. 

Bill brushed the hair from my face. He smiled, tears running down his face.

**And we kissed.**
