"Kiiiill yoooouw!!"

The veterinarian paled, and dropped the needle she'd been holding, mouth working mutely as she tried to process what she'd just heard. I sighed inwardly. This *wasn't* comfortable, but it was a damn sight better than what would happen to me if I didn't get rid of her for a minute. I tried again, forcing my mouth, throat and tongue to contort in approximations of sounds they were never designed to make.

"Ayyyyy....kyilllll....yoooooooouw!"

That did the trick. She screamed and fled the room, but I was sure she'd be back -- it can't have been the first time an animal expressed its desire to murder her, after all. The cage I was in was *designed* to hold cats, of course, but not cats who *understood how they worked.* I shoved my paw through the thin bars, wriggling and squirming to get the right angle, and then reached around to where to where the catch was. I got a claw under it and flipped it up, then withdrew my paw and nudged the door open. Just like that, I was out.

I leaped from my cage, and scampered across the floor of the procedure room. I passed by a purse on the floor -- the vet's, judging by the employee photo ID clipped to it. Naturally, I paused for just a moment to piss on it thoroughly. Then I noticed the needle on the floor, still stuck into a large ampule labeled as an animal tranquilizer. I started purring involuntarily.

I first met my cat Skipper about a month ago. I'd been feeling lonely for a while -- I work weird hours, and that means I don't have much of a social life, unfortunately. I decided I wanted to get a pet, and decided on a cat because they tend to be more independent. I didn't know how much time I'd be able to spend with it on a daily basis. When I went to the shelter, the receptionist was away from the counter, so I decided to have a seat and wait for someone to see me, so I could fill out the forms and then get taken around to see the pets available for adoption.

No sooner had I sat down than a young woman in a labcoat and scrubs burst through the swinging door behind the desk, a look of terror on her face. She leaned heavily on the reception desk, panting.

"Are you okay, miss?" I asked, hesitantly, alarmed by her expression. "Is something wrong?"

"Back there...there's a...it's a..." she wheezed, struggling to articulate what had horrified her.

I stood cautiously, glancing over her shoulder as I noticed the door start to swing out -- it swung closed again, so I looked back at her. "Is there something I can do to h--"

My words were cut off by a loud hiss of feline rage, and I took an involuntary step back as a massive gray cat leaped onto her shoulders, causing her to start flailing and screaming wildly. This part you're not going to believe, but I swear it's true. In his mouth, this freaking cat was holding a *hypodermic needle.* As he jumped onto her back, in one smooth motion he wrapped a foreleg around her neck, lightly raking her skin with his claws, and then he jerked his head to the side sharply, jamming the needle into her neck. With his free paw, he depressed the plunger, and a moment later her thrashing ceased and she crumpled to the floor, unconscious.

I heard shouts from elsewhere in the building -- others had clearly heard the commotion. I didn't know what to do. The cat was scrabbling uselessly at the exit door and hissing, footsteps were pounding down the hall deeper in the building. I suddenly realized that no one was going to believe *the cat* had stabbed the vet with a needle. That thought froze me in utter horror at my own predicament, until the cat snapped me out of it. He left the door and ran up to me, then stood up on his hind legs so his forepaws rested on my thigh.

"Hyellll...myeeeeeeee!" he hissed and yowled, looking up at me...I swear it sounded like he was trying to say "Help me!"

I paused only a moment longer, staring at my desperate feline accomplice. "Ooookay. You got it, skipper." I muttered, scooping him up into my arms and fleeing through the front door.

My paws rested on the fridge, as I carefully nudged the brightly colored magnets around its cool metal surface with my nose.

Gary is good people -- a real stand-up guy. I don't know about his new girlfriend Sandra, I'm still feeling her out. I'm pretty sure I heard her say the "n" word once or twice, and I'm not talking about the racial slur. That's gonna have to stop...or I'm gonna have to arrange an *accident* for her.  Hey, I'm not a monster. If she straightens up and flies right, she'll be just fine. You tell me you wouldn't do the same, in my position -- like hell you wouldn't.

All in all, though, if you've got to be turned into a cat by a curse, there are worse places to live. Which is not to say Gary couldn't use an upgrade -- his digs *are* kinda shabby. Lucky for him, I was working on that for him right now.

"Holy hell..." Gary breathed, holding his camera steady as he filmed me. "Sandra...are you seeing this, baby?"

"Oh, Skipper, sweetie..." she murmured, clasping her hands over her mouth as her eyes brimmed with tears.

Satisfied with my work, I dropped back to the floor, turned to Sandra and Gary, and let out the soft, heart-meltingly musical "meow" I'd practiced to perfection. The alphabet magnets on the fridge now spelled out "I LOVE YOU", except I turned the 'E' backwards on purpose -- for some reason people *love* it when I do that crap. Even Gary was sniffling and wiping at his eyes, now.

That oughta be good for another million YouTube subscribers or so, I thought, as I sauntered over to my food dish where fresh Ahi tuna awaited me. Never liked fish when I was human, but *now* it's like a plate full of frickin' *heroin* or something, I can't get enough of it.

See, what I figured out is this: animals get treated all kinds of different ways by people -- it just depends on the people. That's life. *Valuable* animals, though, *talented* animals, especially if they're also cute as hell (if I do say so myself), they tend to get treated a lot *better.*
