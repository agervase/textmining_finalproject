"Look at those *abs*! Holy crap, they look like the one Jason yonder had 17 years 23 days 2 hours 12 minutes 1 second 712 pneumonanoseconds ago!" Clara gushed as I rolled my eyes. It was a pain understanding their lingo, especially since I'd only received knowledge on Fermat's Last Theorem and the like, but I was starting to learn. Though elementary grade students could still far surpass my understanding. She held a tiny computer in her hand, made of component's I'd never heard of, though she was huffing and puffing at its weight. I remembered the first time, when I lifted one of them and laughed at its lightness. It was lighter than a feather. But the slimness of the limbs and the 'degramaglariation' of the 'scrulesis movement of gloglari molecules' caused it. I didn't know shit about what that meant, but I took it to mean something important. My knowledge on physics was vast at my time, but now? Physics was nothingness; ot at least, mixed and matched with various other studies I'd never heard of or dabbled with, one of them being cryogenesis. My value at the college was that: a real life cryogenesis example from way past. I liked the idea of young girls patting my stomach, but it was morally repulsive for a man of my age.

"Well," said John, a bright young boy who at least took the time to understand the basics and theories of the past, "Let's get you started, Albert!" I winced, partly at the excitement and partly at the way I was called. I rubbed my tousled hair thoughtfully, though my thoughts were probably processed by electrovolcalolic partimolesules. I couldn't care less.

"Call me Mr. Einstein, please," I corrected him.
