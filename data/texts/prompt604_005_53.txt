Soon, would be the contests for the crown. The small Kingdom of Arnkael played a unique role in the world, that it was the peaceful bulwark between humanity and the indiscriminate wrath of the gods themselves.

Each generation, as the old king died, his several children would be pressed to the arena to challenge each other for the crown. This tradition began long ago, with the great Cataclysm that set Man against itself and tore asunder many mountains and plains, the time the gods granted their awesome power to many mortal men in a bid for their own supremacy. The surviving few of the world raised great protest against the needless devastation that their patrons had wrought, and humbled by their followers the gods wrought a compromise with mankind.

The first of the new human kingdoms was formed, headed by one of the last of those demigods who had fought in service of the heavens. To settle their scores, the gods would delegate to only one champion each among his sons and daughters, and to each champion, one God. Thus the new order would be determined through patience and skill, and humanity over time took great interest in these battles, even as they rebuilt and the other kingdoms grew larger and greater. As each king died Arnkael became a site of pilgrimage for the faithful and the powerful, to know which God would gain their support.

Central to this was the Choosing, an event held behind closed doors within Arkael's lone cathedral, where the children forced to slay their kin would receive the power and knowledge that would serve them in battle and kingship, the power of the old demigods that stood to protect Arnkael as it continued to serve it's high purpose. 

The 'young king' Ather, beloved by Demeter, had passed this spring from an ailment of his breath, leaving seven princes and princesses to follow his footsteps, and today at high summer they came down from the palace to know their maker.
