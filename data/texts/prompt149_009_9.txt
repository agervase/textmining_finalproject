The menacing gauntlet of Chi'Gaan was sealed away for centuries. Generations have passed that the stories were thought of as myths. Long enough time has wilted away that the horrors have been forgotten. Long has it been that the demon that held the chains of life has been locked away behind his own weaponry where no man may find it. That is, no *man* has found it. A woman, through foolishness and bravery has searched long and far to resurrect the demon that enslaved all of humanity; Shiyla Teveryn (Sheila Teveron). A lone woman. Through the story of a drunkard at a bar, she embarked on a quest of unknowns. Those who sacrifice everything to recover the gauntlet may make any wish of their deepest desires. At the cost of their soul and humanity, to walk the rest of the eternal plains as a hollow slave to their master. That they slowly degrade into nothing. And once they perish, they will be trapped in his realm forever.

Miles she has walked, through oceans she has crossed, through temples and fortresses that she has broke through. After nearly a decade of searching, she found it. She enters the darkness of the room, as whispers crowd around her. The closer she got, the louder they became. The gauntlet rested in the very center of the large room, chains rung all around. She could see them dangling ever so eagerly. When she made it right to the gauntlet, she could feel her muscles grow weak, she could not sweat, she couldn't breathe, she nearly fell to her knees. She took hold of the gauntlet. The darkness turned into light, the chains broke free, a gust of wind blew into the room as she was pulled back onto her feet. 

**heh heh heh Heh HA HA HA HA Ha HA**

A dark ominous voice engulfed the room. A voice that can drive thousands to their knees, a great madness. Shiyla was rising into the air and the walls melted away. She was no longer in a temple, but a throne room. She was in the center of this room, chains bound her into the air. She could not move a single muscle. Her body was paralyzed. She could feel a cold grip on her soul from the chains as they slowly pulled away at it. All around the room were tall pillars, larger than any city she has seen. She was but a speck in this grand plane. From far away she can see large glowing eyes captured in the darkness. It was her master. Chi'Gaan. He was as terrifying as the stories made him out to be. 

**Foolish mortal, what could possibly bring you here to me? What desire could you possibly have that you would be willing to sacrifice yourself to me for?**

Shiyla regained the ability to move herself once more, she could now truly feel the weight of the chains around her. She struggled to pull out words. Her eyes were rolling into the back of her head, her body swung, but remained still. Every second felt longer. She could feel great spasms from every part of her. The pain made it hard for her to concentrate, she could not remember what brought her here. Her memory was fading.

**Weak** 

Shiyla gasped. All of the pain disappeared. She was within the palm of the great demon before her. She was on her knees.

**Well, what is it?**

I want....I want... to be trapped here in your engulfing plane of existence as your slave, master.

The demon was taken aback. **What did you say human?**

You heard me, I want to be your slave forever. I want you keep your gauntlet as a reminder that I am yours, but you are mine. My master. Just you, me, and the thousands of tortured souls. Do whatever you want to my body, it's your skin.

The demon was very unhappy, but he had to grant her wish. A wish that brought no benefit to anyone. **MORTAL, WHAT FOOL DO YOU PLAY ME FOR? YOU CAN HAVE ANY WISH YOU WANT, AND YOU WASTE IT ON THE CONSEQUENCE.**

Yes, master. That is my wish.

**MORTAL, WHY WOULD YOU WASTE EVERY PART OF YOUR PATHETIC EXISTENCE ON THIS WISH? DO YOU TRULY HAVE NO DESIRES?**

No master, you are wrong. I am a masochist. This is not my desire, this is my fantasy.
