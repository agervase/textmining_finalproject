My name is Gerald Michaels, and I beat the Grim Reaper in a chess game. I've only played chess a few times in my life, but I knew the rules all too well. It took me 5 moves that day, and I won the one game that death had put for me. Five moves, in total, and he made the last one. Yet I won.

My life was never particularly extraordinary. I had a wife, kids, a house, hell, I even had two dogs. Yet, that did not scratch the insatiable urge in my heart for something more. I searched my whole life for it to no avail. The thing that I wanted was not within reach of me. I died an old, decrepit, haggard old man who never found his purpose. I closed my eyes, and decades of experience washed into the abyss. 

"Care for a game?" He said. And a game we played, one that lasted under two minutes after the rules were explained. All I had to do is win, Death had to fold his knight, and that would be that.

I moved a pawn. He moved one too to match me. I moved one up a space, and he matched the same.

"Death," I began, "Can you touch the top of your king? I'm curious if they're the same size. Mine and yours?" 

He put his bone-y finger, aged with years of post-mortem murder and finess on the tip of the king. And when he touched it, I let out the loudest, mouth earth shattering, ear splitting scream the void had ever known. And it fucking worked. Death reeled back in shock. His finger tapped the king, it touched the bottom of the board. Death had conceded the game.

He was not amused. I waited a moment, while the anger in Death subsided. I waited longer, and longer.

What now?

"Death?" I said, "What happens now?" And all he could answer was... whatever I wanted. 

Ninety-five years I searched on this Earth for the thing I wanted. And, while clarity is not that thing, it gave me the ability to know in that moment what I wanted.

"Death," I smiled. "Show me the cosmos."
