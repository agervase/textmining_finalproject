[As of yet Entitled]


In the confines of my youth, with messy hair and missing tooth, |

Close down all business and disappear, did the man Elon Musk. |

Oh woe to me my thirst for pain, for I had ever sought to gain, |

from success I could not refrain, a golden ticket with which my eyes did lust. |

To some regret I thieved the page, my own name I had brought to dust |

all this and more for Elon Musk. | 



Amidst hatred and hate anon, I entered doors from times bygone |

Locked in from all those who no longer openly gave me trust, |

A tattered hall that once was sleek, but now run down, all dry and meek, |

I was invited to a seat; and coughed among a cloud of dust. |

Bodyless, a voice spoke to me, and on my chair I moved and fussed |

This was not the voice of Musk. |



“Take off all clothes and burn them there, scrub your skin and shave your hair. |

You may not proceed unless we know that you are one to trust” |

Although I wished to not proceed, the crowd will kill me for my deed, |

From inside I could hear them plead, driven mad with a bloody lust. |

I Stripped down bare, all clean and bald, as now into this world I had been thrust |

All this and more for Elon Musk. |



Still now my heart is gripped ice cold, as I recount this tale of old, |

for within that hall I lived until my skin began crust. |

Alone and mad for years on end, was this a thing he did intend? |

Given the chance I would contend, “I’m imprisoned by Elon Musk.” |

No food or water, no sleep nor sorrow, I could not adjust, |

Please give me more, Elon Musk. |





Sustained my life, I knew not how, I was in my final years now, |

Though a red mist crept in a vent, the scent of a strong musk. |

With no instruction from that voice, I had been left with little choice |

“death unto me” I did devoice, send I to ash and Elon to dust. |

I held my breath and wept a prayer over my old and dried husk, |

No more from me, Elon Musk. |



Before death’s hand had touched my soul, or lack of air would take its toll, |

My world and skin unpeeled as though the days I had been untrussed. |

“You broke our spell” the voice proclaimed, “and also helped us learn the same.  |

By now you will recall your name, You’re far from a dried up old husk |

Look and see no time has passed the window shows that it’s still dusk. |

This red mist, by Elon Musk” |



“Release me from this hell!” I pled, unlock the doors, cause no more dread |

I would face the murder that awaits me outside if I must!” |

But “No” the voice softly replied, “Going back can never be tried, |

Your purpose will be satisfied.” On hearing this, I wailed and cussed. |

“Proceed ahead through the door, make haste or see body combust. |

We cleanse each room for Lord Musk” |



The double doors sealed tight behind, a sound of flame and metal grind |

I understood that all in that room alive had burnt to dust. |

In shock, eyes bulged and breath escaped, how many more had Elon raped – |

Before me men and women draped in mist filled jars, a sight of true disgust. |

Each one, like I, just moments hence, prisoned in their mind by musk. |

Show me no more Elon Musk! |





“Continue down the corridor, and see humans in such deplore, |

Some will sit still, others will rage; depends on the color of musk. |

We have much more to test on you, do not resist and let us view, |

Persist and make attempt to do your best to be no more entrussed.” |

I make good my way to find this man, for I am no mollusk  |

I will murder Elon Musk. |
