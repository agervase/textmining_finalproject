Monsters. As people grow old, they stop believing in them.

As I entered the seemingly abandoned warehouse, I could hear what sounds like echoes from knocking and banging on metal. Was it the monster?

I pass through a small passage only slightly covered by old torn-out curtains... *Giant cages!?* There is no doubt that this place... is so wrong to be the right place.

My mind was racing with every step until suddenly, within a split second, everything turned dark and my heart skipped a beat.

&#x200B;

**There it was.**

&#x200B;

Lying on the ground was the massive beast, emasculated and RAPED, blood ran down its face and onto the cold ground as if it was crying red.

The dry blood and the smell left no doubt - THE BEAST IS DEAD.

And justice? I never believed in such a thing... so now I am here for only one reason.

I have seen these sights too many times to let my guard down. I walk towards the sounds coming deeper from within the warehouse.

&#x200B;

Like a lion sighting pray, my pupils instantly shrank and my vision focused only on one thing - THE MONSTER.

&#x200B;

I stepped towards it with only one intention in mind. By the time the monster became aware of my presence - it was already too late. The monster hastily turned around, but became petrified without even realizing - both of my hands were already wrapped around its neck, lifting it from the ground.

"Wh... what ar... who...", the monster tried to utter.

There are never any clever last words by these monsters. *Will this one be any different?* I think to myself as I loosen my grip.

"I will never kill again. I swear on my m..." - I tighten my grip once more.

"I swear. That was the last Black Rhino."

\-"It may be so", I whispered.

In Africa only the rules of the jungle apply. I don't believe in justice, but still, I showed this... **MONSTER**... more mercy than he has ever shown.

The poacher did not suffocate for long because I stopped the blood flow to his brain and he perished within seconds.

Next to the poacher's body, on a metal table, among the various slaughtering weapons, rested the beast's horn - its beauty, its power - ready to be polished in order to be marketed for potential buyers... as if there was some pride in this gruesome image it has represented.

Monsters. As people grow old, they stop believing in them. But the truth is, monsters are among us all - because nothing can be more evil than humans.

I meet my wife and daughter at at the local mall. There is a petting area that has opened especially for Christmas - they brought friendly deers which you can feed and pet.

"Daddy!", she screams blisfully as she runs towards my arms. "Did you see these unicorns have TWO horns?!"
