"Sector 2. Clear."

&nbsp;

"Sector 5. Clear."

&nbsp;

"Sector 1. Clear"

&nbsp;

"Sector 3. Clear. Hey chief, why the hell are *We* stuck out here watching the ass end of nowhere when it's Delta's turn to-"

&nbsp;

"Because Delta was ambushed by a USW while they were talking instead of watching their sectors. Now lips shut, eyes open Smith."

&nbsp;

"Sir!"

&nbsp;

Pack Lead Amelia Francesca shook her head and turned her own attention back to her scanner array. Sector 2 was clear. She prayed it would stay that way. Delta's lack of presence had been indeed due to an ambush, but it was hardly the fault of incompetent pilots. Delta had been hit during a High Alert situation, the two survivors...well, one survivor now, reported something had come up from under them, collapsed the ground under their feet and buried half the pack alive before anyone could react.

&nbsp;

So here was Bravo, six mechs, armed to the teeth and kitted out with seismic sensors in addition to their usual gear. It was proving to be a long night, the tree line was quiet. The half mile band of barren dirt that served as a buffer zone was devoid of life, and aside from Smith's jabbering complaints, the coms and monitors were silent. *Maybe we'll catch a break tonight...* She thought.

&nbsp;

"Sir! Contact, sector 5. Ping on the seismic." *Of course.*

&nbsp;

"Hang tight Bravo-5. Bravo-2, go and see what's out there." A pair of acknowledgements pinged on her display and she watched the tacmap as the dot marking 2 began moving from it's patrol path towards 5. She synced her sensor unit up with 5's and checked the readings herself. Whatever it was, it was either really small, or really deep. "All units, drop thumper pikes and converge on 5. I have a bad feeling about this."

&nbsp;

"2-Lead. Not seeing anything but my seismo is pinging louder, whatever it is is getting cl- CONTACT CONTACT. Hostile force confirmed. Some kind of worm thing. Tried to pull me under."

&nbsp;

"Copy 2. Bravo pack, weapons free, switch to thermals and fire at will. 2,5, Status?" 

&nbsp;

Bravo 5 was moving in at full speed to assist, fifty tons of war machine storming across the buffer zone to aid the smaller scout model. 2 meanwhile was using their jump-jets to keep out of reach of the much bigger, but slower hostile. When the rest of the lance showed up, it was a light show of autocannon tracers, laser blasts and thrown spells. 

&nbsp;

Targets were marked, and the team got to work. Prioritizing the giant worm decked in dwarven armor, their ignoring most of the smaller spells being cast by the handful of elves  that were trying to emerge in the worms wake. Bravo 2 was dancing circles around the emergence hole, harrying the casters with it's flamethrower. 

&nbsp;

The worm was taking the hits like a champ, even with the concentrated fire of five MBM's and a light scout. A new contact appeared on the seismograph and Amelia couldn't help but smirk. Smith had finally caught up in his 147 ton monster of an assault mech. With the heavy Rail-repeaters and particle cannons of the Odin Class heavy assault mech, the battle ended quickly. The scout mopping up the survivors as a few SRMs closed the emergence point.

&nbsp;

"Good job Bravo, fan out, search for any stragglers." As she waited for command to pick up, she couldn't help but chuckle at Smith's parting advice to the enemy. 

&nbsp;

"Humanity Bitches!"

&nbsp;

"Fuck yeah."
