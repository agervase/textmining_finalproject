God.

Alas! Earth has been created! Seeing an opportunity for life, The Creator created man and woman, Adam and Eve. The two mortals lived prosperously, until the deceitful devil tricked them into eating the forbidden fruit, from the Tree of Knowledge. After both of them had their bites, reality splurged in. They were naked. They were alone. There's a voice that tells them what to do. The Creator, disappointed of their actions, banished them from the Heavens.

As the Kingdom of God was separated from Earth, man became much more sinful. Crime. Lust. Greed. Everything came about. But, when the people started making idols, and worshipping them instead of God, he was pushed into his limits. There came Yahweh, a stricter God, for an undisciplined time. He made heroes and prophets. He used magic and legends. He brought the He in Hero, but, there was something missing. Man needed much more intricate help. They need a Messiah.

As the cold rain poured, Mary and Joseph were searching for a place to rest. The census was made, and they were desperate. Inn after Inn, they were not given entry, but a humble stable was supplied unto them, by God. Mary was promised to give birth the new Messiah, son of the Living God , and then began the era of Jesus Christ. Now a father by nature, God is pushed to be much more sensitive and understanding, but still shows his power through his miracles, but time passes by.

Years after Christ's ascension, God was not felt. He did not make miracles or such. He did not speak to people. He did not bring any heroes or prophets. He was just there. There came no proof of his existence, and the people's belief on him soon faded away. But, still, many took part in his faith. Many held unto him. Why? Because, he is there.

He was. He is. He will be.
