I remember the day when I was declared the winner of the 74th Killing Hitler games (KHG) as if it was yesterday. The shocked faces of the jury after I came back. After I had manipulated the time machine to not bring me to 1933, but to 1895.

**Court of the 74 KHG**

*Mr. Marcuse, would you please tell the jury why you manipulated the time machine?*, asked the judge politely.


Sir, this might take some time. But I will try my best to explain the reasons, to show why I think this was necessary.

First of all, you have to know that I'm sociologist. I'm trying to figure out how people behave in society, how society forms and where it can be changed. I'm also a philosopher who wondered if we have any chance of changing our destiny.

Having grown up with the KHGs and having learned about *panem et circenses** it always felt wrong to me.

*Mr. Marcuse, not everybody has learned Latin. What is panem et circenses?*

Oh, I'm sorry. Its also know as *bread and games*. A simple way to entertain simple minds. By killing people.

(*Rumors start in the court*)

*Mr. Marcuse, I have to warn you. Insulting the court will result in a fine.*

To continue with my story, I just thought there should be a more clever way to use the power of time travel we have. Even if we lose the string of time after a while, we have the imense power of changing the live of billions of people. As we all know, with great power comes great responsibility. So I chose not to kill Hitler.

**You did WHAT?** the judge screamed in anger. **WHY?**

Please, let me explain. I did not kill him, but instead I got his friend.

The court went furious. People began shouting, protesting. The judge screamed **SILENCE!**, hammering on the table.
*At least we should give him a chance to explain. But, Mr. Marcuse, I hope for you that you have a good explanation.*

I do. Ok, where did I stop... ah, yes, so I wanted to become his friend. Not the friend of the monster from 1933, but the friend of the child. Probably friend is the wrong word. Mentor? Teacher?

Anyway. So what I did is giving him examples of Mark Antokolsky and Maurycy Gottlieb. And I persuaded Moritz Daniel Oppenheim become his art teacher. I introduced him to the cruelty of war by paintings of Francisco Goya ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prado_-_Los_Desastres_de_la_Guerra_-_No._03_-_Lo_mismo.jpg), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prado_-_Los_Desastres_de_la_Guerra_-_No._09_-_No_quieren.jpg)). It was hard work. When he signed up as a soldier in WWI, I thought all my efforts were in vain.
But when he came back, his reaction was interesting. He was traumatized as so many. But the way he dealt with it was different. He started to paint. He started to process what has happened by showing others the horror. People dying, being killed silently by gas. The confusion, because in the battlefield it was not always clear who is the enemy. The contact was often lost. War was differnt at that time.

When I heard him speak, I began to hope. Did I just save one soul and the live of millions?

But all my hopes were dashed. It began so promising.
When anti jewish and anti social democratic forced began to form, he was a good friend of some jewish artists. He was against war. He actually made speeches against those forces. Although he was never a good speaker, he was not the demagoge he is known as in our string of time.

However, history changed in a way I would have anticipated.

Instead of him becomming a demagogue, another one was it. I'm not too educated about the history of that time. I don't know who he was. But interestingly, he gave very similar speeches. It seems as I only changed one monster against another one.

What I didn't expect is that Hitler saw this change in society, too. The new, changed Hitler was afraid of how society changed. How his friends were suddenly in danger. So he had the plan to assasinate the new demagogue.

And this is where things started to get really confusing. Hitler went to a speech the other demagoge gave. Interestingly, he gave it at exactly the same time in the same place as Hitler had in our string of time. This time Hitler was on the same position, but planning to assasinate the demagogue. He was just about to carry out his plan, when another contestant of the HKGs arrived and killed Hitler.

From this point, history basically repeated itself. One key figure was exchanged by another key figure. I stayed for some more years to document it.

*Did anybody ever try that? To stay and see what changes?* the judge asked a clerk.

I had seen the same - or at least similar - cruelties as we all know from the documentions. I'm not sure if I had just very bad luck of if we can't change history. No matter if it is our history or one of the infinitly many other strings of time. What does that mean for us?

A couple of days later I was declared the winner of the 74th KHGs. They stopped the series and a serious discussion about the value of live - no matter who it is - started.
