Who DARES TO SUMMON THE SLEEPING...

(What am I saying?, The sleeping atrocity? Where am I, what are these things?)

-oh, It worked! You are the all mighty Dve the accountant! In flesh and bones! Did you enjoy our sacrifices?

-sacrif... OH NO, WHY ARE ALL THOSE THINGS DEAD THAT'S DISGUSTING!
-s... Sorry accountant Dve, it wasn't our intention to off...

-and what is this with Dve? My name is DAVE

-veda?

-Dave!

-ded?

-DAVE!

(the exchange was extended for some minutes, until I understood that names are impronunciable by their tonges)

-OK, stop,what is this place?

-this is the tower of Carnage, one of all your churches here in hell

-so I'm a God? In hell? That sounds pretty good!

-actually... Sir, you are quite a demon for us, that's
 kinda the deal with the sacrifices, the salt cross and all these candles, y'know?

-oh, yes, I was gonna ask what's the thing with the salt

-it is our defense against your rage... Are you sure you are THE DAVE?

-kinda, yeah, for what did you... Â¿Mortals? Summoned me?

-so, this is gonna sound crazy. But I want to make an exchange with you. My soul for you to help me to notarize my students loans

-that really doesn't make any sense to me dude...

-we can pay you

*A few minutes later*

-man, that was easy!, How did you went to college and didn't know how to add 4+4? Those are basic mathematics!

-mathematics? Not even we, the cult of the Dave mess with these obscure arts.

-OK?...

-also, here you have my soul, thank you for your services!

Said while extended me $4000

-so... This is your soul......

I couldn't even finish the sentence, in a fraction of second I was back in the bus, people looked like they didn't even noticed that I was gone for 15 minutes, weird
But hey, 4000 for that time is a pretty good deal! I should start to adequate to the idea of being THE DAVE. I only hope they call back
