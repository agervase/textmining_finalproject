"Okay, new rule....you aren't allowed outside without supervision by either me or my wife, do you understand?" I tried to keep my voice steady. I wasn't yelling, no one is upset...this is what we talked about when we talked about having kids, right? Keeping control of our tone of voice. 

"Look, no one died, and I just...scared'em a little, thats all." the yellow fruit shaped thing said as it sat on the couch. Why did it have an accent like it was from Rhode Island? 

"'That's all'? They had compound fracturs! I saw a guys femur! I dont even understood how you did it, you don't weigh enough to cause that kind of damage!" You're losing it...pull back. 3 deep breaths, no one can connect the two of you, no one will be looking for you. 

"Ey, I'm not the one who got so in over his head with a bookie he decided eldritch magic was a better option than like...a pawn shop or driving for Uber. He ain't botherin' anybody for a few months, now you've got time to get the money together. You're welcome." The last was punctuated by a little mocking bow - at least thats what it looked like, it was so hard to tell, to graft human characteristics onto this citrus nightmare. 

"Matt works for some guy in the city, he's gonna call him and then I'm gonna have 10 guys worse than Maddie up my ass by this time tommorow!"  and the reality sets in. Panic overtakes, I have to find those pills the doctor told me to take when things started to blur at the edges. 

As I walk out of the room the...yellow being on my couch lets out a barking laugh and says "You really don' get it, do you? To get to you, they gotta get through me. And they ain't gettin' through me."
