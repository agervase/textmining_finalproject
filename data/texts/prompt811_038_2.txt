My name is Valfurea, and it is my business to give people what they want.

Let me specific, for that can only help before you form the wrong impression. You see, humans like you beckon us forth with desires that are... well, only able to be called *human,* and you give up something in return. That's not strange, right? You wouldn't expect a plumber to work on your pipes for free because you know their contact information, after all.

Oh put down the purse before you drop it, child. We don't care about human money, and even if we did, you wouldn't have enough to satisfy our fee.

You... don't have anything in there, do you. That was for me to take, wasn't it?

Child, do you not have anything of your own?

Dear me, I believe I might be feeling a twinge of *pity.* To business, however. You offered *everything* when you called, correct? Can you even *begin* to grasp what this means? Why my associates and I hold such *strict* rules on just whom may call upon us, which *you* rather neatly circumvented by using... what manner of blood is this...

But before I get sidetracked, allow me to enlighten you. Your life will be my property, and your every thought will be mine to shape as I please. Should I have some use for you as a vessel, I-...

It means I'll be able to live through you, and *you* will be able to do *nothing* about it because you gave your body willingly. But don't misunderstand. You're far too scrawny for me to possess... tell me child, what and how often do you eat?

I see.

Don't worry about the noise, child. He's going to be coming downstairs for as long as we need. I... am obliged to inform you, that should you choose to strike a bargain, no other form of afterlife will claim you. Your soul will become the property of the one you gave it to... which, of course, will be me as per your offering. I will ask you this only once.

Do you knowingly accept that freedom on earth and in heaven, or whatever equivalent you may yearn for, shall be forever denied to you in exchange for your wish, which you freely and without reservation call upon me to grant?

Good... now we have the *bones,* of our contract, let us provide it with blood and... a pound or so of flesh. ... You understand that reference? Lovely. Hold out your arm for a moment... **splendid...**

Not even a flinch... used to pain, are you? How old are you again? ... I was going to do this part on my own, but now that our contract is semi-binding... take the gun inside that drawer there, will you?

**Kindly do it.** ... Oh? It's locked? There you go.

Got it? Wonderful... now point it straight at the door, and say these words...

I dedicate this act to  Lu-... to *Valfurea,* of my own free will.

You've gripped it tightly? Well done... pull the trigger when I say so.

Three...

Two...

One...

**Now.**

Well done, my child! You've seized freedom with only the faintest amount of aid! What a joyous moment this must be for you!

But alas, aid *was* given, and thus payment is due. Gather some things that you would miss, if anything like that exists here, and let us depart at once.

Nothing but a photo of your mother? Go. Claim it then, and come back here.

What is-... what was she called? Valerie? How... curious. Let us be off now, child. You must hunger, surely? I will see you fed. After all...

My name is Valerie, and it is my business to give people what they want.
