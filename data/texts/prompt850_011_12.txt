Of course we could rely on Yorkshire for some peace and quiet. 

When one of the quakers found out who we were all that changed was that she simply started offering us old remedies for Alex's god-baby pains. And weed too. Rural Yorkshire folk had that strange charm to it. 

As soon as the baby was older than 12 months we got the mild interest of Toronto press's attention and a local priest, they all loved a baby with powers. By 18 it was worldwide and we had all the wrong attention. News outlets were fierce and repetitive every few months but the others were a lot worse. Some trying to make us leave for god knows where with them to be some king's subject, government or corporate automatons with goofy smiles and dead eyes wanting us to live in research compounds and the nutters who tried to take us to their holy places for the sake of jesus, krishna, and a few hundred other gods. Even the scientologists with their cameras were making appearances back in Toronto for us. It dominated our lives for years.

 Until an unassuming old Quaker came to our attention. He didn't say much at first but instead showed us video of his home in North Yorkshire called cottingleigh. A majority quaker village with a huge majority of powered people. It was established in the 40s as a British secret service colony and training area, for people with extraordinary powers. When the war ended the British government didn't stop their efforts, they continued nurturing the small hilly area, keeping a top of the range "specialist" school a hospital for monitoring and nurturing the populace and an intelligence base for keeping the town secret and safe. All our preferences about city life hadn't mattered for years. It was the perfect place.
