The pentagram flared, its ashen lines crackling with green flame, and a great column of smoke erupted from the sigil in the center to crash against the ceiling of the black-tiled ceiling of the chamber.  A figure took shape in its depths, hulking and muscled, its bronze skin glimmering softly in the light of the two torches on the walls, a crest of horns crowning its skull, a pair of golden eyes shining with Lucifer’s light through the heavy haze.  It opened its black-fanged maw, and in a voice like a pounding timpani it intoned, “So you have summoned me, and so I have come.  I, Duke Siovarl of the Deepest Plane, hereby pledge my glorious darkness to your service.  What foul deed would you have me do today?”

The magenta-robed young man in front of him tilted his head, a bemused smile on his face.  “Dude,” he said, “the game starts in five minutes and this is, like, the hundredth time I’ve summoned you.  You don’t need to do the intro.”

Siovarl laughed, unleashing a torrent of foul wind that scattered the ritual smoke and left the room smelling vaguely of overcooked fish- clearly, the demon had forgotten to brush his teeth today.  “It’s written into the pentagram, buddy.  You’re stuck with the melodrama and the grovelling until the end of the campaign.”

The summoner smiled wider, idly toying with the aged copy of *Codex Daemonica Vol. 5 Ed. 9 (with new foreword from Caelis Bloodripper!)* in his hands.  “Oh, what, you’re not gonna stick around?  Are we going to have to find a new DM after this?”

“Dane,” Siovarl said, wagging a wickedly taloned finger.  “I’m sure there are other qualified game masters in the Deepest Plane.”

“None as cool as you,” Dane replied, still smiling.

“Ha!  Flatterer,” said Siovarl.  “As if I’d leave you idiots anyways.  Last campaign, you lot somehow managed to catapult a Chaos Titan into a black hole halfway across the galaxy- no way in hell I’m missing something like that again.”

**”LANGUAGE,”** croaked a voice deeper and darker than the lowest pits of the Dread Abyss.

Dane blinked and took an involuntary step back.  “Uh, do we have a stowaway?”

Siovarl laughed again, and Dane tried his best to inconspicuously cover his nose.  “No, no,” the demon said.  “That’s Kalotaros, my new d20.”  He reached into the mane of coal-colored thorns threading his back and plucked out what appeared to be an amorphous blob of ink-black goo.  “Say hi, Kalo.”

The blob extruded a tiny pink tongue and blew a raspberry in Dane’s general direction.

Siovarl chuckled.  “I promise he won’t get cheeky like Daeis Massa did and start rolling nothing but natural twenties for enemy hits.”

**”I GUARANTEE NOTHING.”**

“Um, yeah, ignore him.”

The door to the summoning chamber creaked open, and a large, wrinkled gray head with slitted black eyes poked inside.  “Uh, guys?” said Third-Creche Go’alan in his distinctive high-pitch Martian tones.  “Can we get started?  Traffic back to Phobos is gonna be rougher than usual tonight, and it’s not exactly fun even on the best of days.”

“I feel you, man,” Siovarl said.  “The Interstitial Tides were murder on planar travel today.  I’ll get set up in a couple minutes.”  He held out a hand and a flaming backpack appeared upon it, a second edition copy of a Dark Heresy game master’s handbook poking out from beneath the front flap.  “Make sure to save a couple bags of Fritos for me, okay?  Earth food is contraband back home now, and I’m seriously hungry for some corn chips.”

(Hope it's okay that I'm a day late!  Also I made the game Dark Heresy because I was reading 40k stuff earlier.  That's not a problem, right?)
