The clang of metal on metal echoed throughout the dark room. I knew there would be none to come and help me. Everyone I ever cared about had already been taken by the void. I was utterly alone, but I wouldn’t go easily.

With an inhuman snarl the scythe whipped back around for another blow and I quickly moved to parry the swing a second time.

Clang...

The shadow cloaked in darkness spoke barely above a whisper. “Foolish mortal, no one can deny the void. Your time is up. Now come quietly.”

“I think not. No one has ever defeated me before, and I’m hardly about to lay down and take defeat without my chance at victory.” I snapped back at him.

“There is no victory. There is no defeat. You were dead before I walked in. All that is left is acceptance before I rip you free from this realm. You may be the most stubborn customer I’ve had but you will be coming with me in the end.”

With rage I slashed back at the specter. My sword passed right through him and rang again in my ears as it bounced off of the scythe.

Death spoke anew.

“Well it seems that the scythe isn’t going to be the tool for the job today. But no matter. To be honest, I never thought I’d get to use this little guy once firearms became popular.”

There was a rustling in his cloak, and an emaciated skeletal hand drew out from a deep pocket holding what appeared to be a short stick. He raised his hand high above his head and pressed the decayed pad of his thumb against the end of the stick.

My sword grew white hot and folded in on itself as I dropped it in agonizing pain. I felt both of my legs snap in two as I fell to the ground screaming and curled into the fetal position. I looked up begging for the pain to end.  

Death smiled. 

He lowered his hand and placed the pen back in his pocket. Then he grabbed me by the shoulder and darkness took me.
