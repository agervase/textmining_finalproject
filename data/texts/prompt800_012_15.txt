My deepest cut?  Easy.  Upper right hip, curving from almost my navel to my asscrack.  It's an unusual, but fortunately concealed,  spot for me; usually I'm an arm guy, so my parents always dressed me in tshirts, for conveniences sake when asking if I'd done my homework.  You'd think they'd have figured it out, after I was held back a grade...

But this chick.  Now, I'm a man who knows what I like.  Short, curly hair, sundresses, enough scars to show a wild side, few enough scars that I know I won't get a 'git-scar.  Happened to one of my buddies once; after his girlfriend found out his "I'm not cheating on you" mark was hidden under his beard, she cut more than hair in taking it off.  I told him dating a girl with skin textured like prairie grass was bad news, but he just couldn't resist the crazies.  Birds of a feather, I suppose...

But back to this girl.  She had it all.  The dress.  The hair.  The... scar.  Some chicks hide them, some showcase them.  She was a shower, and damn, did she have a lot to show. The dress had to be custom tailored, for it framed and flattered the deep colors of the scar along her back perfectly.  But other than that... flawless.  Already I longed to stroke her smooth arms, kiss her milky neck, lift up her already short dress...

I approached, and distracted by the juxtaposition of beauty and destruction, went with the lamest, most common of openings.  I gestured towards her.  "That's quite the display.  Is it 'git?"

Her laughter, as expected, sounded like the tinkling of bells.  "But of course it's legit!" she said.  "It was a tragic accident..." she looked solemn, for a moment, as if getting lost in a painful memory, but then her smile, refreshing as a spring shower, returned.  "Though of course, that might not be the case.  After all, I only ever speak in lies."
