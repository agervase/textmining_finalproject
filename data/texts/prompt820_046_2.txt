Each year thousands of weapons find themselves discarded, forgotten, abandoned. However, only the truest of weapons find themselves adorning the Armament Hall. The deadliest, most well known weapons are allowed the honor to reside here.

Each hundred years only one true warrior is allowed into the Armament Hall to choose a weapon of his choosing to either create or destroy.

Guardians, heroes, villains, gods, have all passed through this hall. Some have chosen weapons that led them to greatness, others forged it themselves and when they fell their weapon was laid to rest along the walls of this hall.

This year, however, an unlikely warrior stepped into the hall for the first time. The ornate doors opened themselves just for him. Once inside all that was light was a pedestal. Our warrior walked up to the pedestal and the only thing he found was a blank sheet of paper.

Discouraged our warrior sighed heavily, "I walk against thousands and stand victorious every time. I have worked harder than any known mortal only to find this."

* "Not everything is as it seems." A voice replied.

"Who goes there?" Our warrior threatened, drawing his sword.

* "Put that down, no need for things to get rash."

"I have slain gods, slaughtered worlds and this is the treatment I get? I have heard the rumors, been told the tales. Where. Is. My. Weapon?"

* "That will come in time, however, tell me. What you know about this place?"

Our warrior calmed himself and sheathed his sword, "I have heard many things. Alexander the Great, King Arthur, Genghis Khan have all walked through here, even the gods Thor, Zeus and Ra. King-slayers, the greatest warriors of all time have all passed through this hall. You have granted them power beyond their wildest dreams. Some have even taught others how to harness their own power, wield it, draw from it, immerse themselves in power."

* "Correct, now what makes you think you are worthy?"

"I have conquered Time and Space itself, slain an alien god and his son, and stopped another alien race from harnessing self-replicating nanites that would have destroyed the only land that is sacred to me."

* "Correct, I have seen all that you have done. And I shall grant you a weapon, one that will strike fear into the hearts of many. It shall kill many. It's name will be feared. However, along my walls are many weapons. You will find that one in particular speaks to you. It may seem weak or useless, but remember even the smallest of daggers will sometimes kill a giant."

The light that shone on the pedestal grew until both walls of the immense hall were lit. After that the voice was silent. Our warrior looked onto the pedestal and found the paper had something written on it. Something that wasn't there before.

*You will find a weapon, there will have been 63 others before it. But this one will be yours. It will shoot like a sniper but feel like a shotgun.*

With this paper our warrior walked along the hall. He saw many different things, a suit made of Iron, many swords of all shapes and sizes. None of them felt right. He saw weapons of fire, much like the one's he was familiar with. But picking it up did not feel powerful enough. Finally the room shifted from handheld melee weapons to firearms. Hand guns, snipers, artillery, all adorned the wall, but one stood out. Our warrior picked it up off the wall. It felt familiar. Like an old handshake.

Looking to the sheet of paper the text had changed. 

*Be the Bull.*
