"Welcome. You have been selected for the New Life Plus Programme. In 5 minutes, you will be relaunched into a human life. Do you have any questions?" 
A soft mysterious voice was echoing in the grand hall. Behind me, there were 11 other confused people, recently dead. 
One guy, a fify-ish man in black formals, shouted at the ceiling, "Why us and what's this programme all about?" The same soft voice replied, "Each one of you has died an unnatural death and all of you together have diverse skills that you acquired during your life at Earth. You will be born again and retain your skills from the previous life. You shall remember this afterlife but no memory from your previous life will stay with you. All of you are lucky to be enlisted in our newest experimental venture, New Life Plus." 
"Experimental?" A lady behind me murmured. She must have been in her thirties. She was a short, healthy lady with brown hair and a pretty face. This woman was looking as if she could faint any time. I wondered how she died. With a sudden panic, I realized I had no memory of my own life or the circumstances of my death. I looked around me and found my reflection on the floor. A young boy, with some facial hair and an average looking face looked back at me. My hair were messy and I looked as if I needed a bath. I was wearing a blue oversized jacket and ragged jeans. 
"Good luck to you!" The voice startled me. Each one of us was terrified. Without another warning, the place around us started to disappear into a blank white void. A blinding flash of light engulfed my vision and the next thing I knew, I was a baby.
