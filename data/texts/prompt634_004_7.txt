I've made a lot of deals with a lot of unsavory types, all in pursuit of my true end goal. I know bigfoot exists and I intend to track him, or her, down.

It was jarring at first, discovering someone that never expected to be found... some attack you, others plead for discretion, others try to run. I've gotten pretty good at tracking them down, even if they're not the one I'm actually after.

I stumbled on a vampire almost purely by accident. I was out late getting some snacks and took a turn down a dark alley. Jumpy lot, he tried to bite me, but I guess the garlic & onion chips I had been munching on kept him at bay. Ended up chatting for a while, in return for keeping his existence a secret he got me some clues from his kin. I still get occasional postcards from them for the holidays.

It wasn't long after that I caught a unicorn in a trap. Poor thing was scared, but I freed it. It gave me a ride for a time, but my true quarry wasn't in that area so we parted ways.

I found that I really don't like fairies. After finding their grove the tricksters sent me on a path that was completely wrong. But it did lead me to meeting the werewolf, who has proven helpful in tracking. He's a good guy, sometimes a little bitey but I make sure to keep him fed.

I've been around the world several times, always on bigfoot's trail but always behind. Mermaids helped me ashore after my boat capsized in a storm. Got a lift from a gryphon to the top of a mountain. Bartered for information from a sketchy goblin. Almost got eaten by a dragon. I've found almost every mythical creature, except for the one I set out to find originally.

You should then understand the mixture of frustration and excitement I felt when I came home one day to find bigfoot lounging in my apartment eating my potato chips.
