"Cmon buddy here you go..."

"No" I said, "No sir." 

I watched his face go from a smile to a frown and I feared for the worse.  

"CMON BUDDY, TAKE IT," droplets of his sweat and saliva fall on my face, his wrinkles become more wrinkled.  

Unhindered by his display, he pushed and shoved a spoonful of gummie bears in my mouth.  At this moment, necessity freed me of my hesitation.  I pushed and shoved him out of the way and I puked as much as I can on the open street.  I must run to the hospital. 

But the stares, from a lady pushing her baby, the old man staring up from her paper, and the hostess from the diner, all staring at my bombast-ed actions.  I must be dripping radioactive waste, why are my knees shaking? The high rise buildings were closing in on me and I felt weak.

I'm no victim, no, they are just under the impression that I lived too long.

I'm only 25, wait, 75?... So I arrived at the age.  My friends' graves clear in my mind.

"Anyone help!" I screamed "I have been poisoned!"

But no nurses cared so I pushed one down.

"Listen, you have to help me!" I screamed "I'm not going to hurt you!!!"  And the nurse screamed, "Get off of me you creep."  This is the part when I fell down some stairs;  I must of been helpless.  My eyesight went and I thought I died.

But I woke up, and I saw the white apron of a waiter full of life. The waiter was shaking me violently as if my life depended on it.  I resumed my position, and I saw my wife and loved ones staring at me, wondering if I died in my sleep.  

"Oh man what a dream." I said, "did I really snore that loud?" And everyone laughed and clapped.

"Complementary desert," my best friend said, "on another birthday for Johnny, my best friend from high school."  Perhaps I'm not going to die today after all.  My heart sank.  I realized I can eat the desert and live too.
