When everything lost the ability to die, things changed. People stopped caring so much about safety. Why bother with normal rules when nothing can kill you?

Until they realized what the inability to die meant. You didn’t just get to live happily. You aged. Your injuries healed just as slowly as normal. Disease spread infinitely and no one got better. Pains compounded on pains until all one could wish for was the sweet release of death. 

Once a few years had passed, people started searching for a “way out.” Everything from self-immolation to covering oneself with explosives to blocking your breathing for days. Some people buried themselves alive in a futile mimicry of the grave. Some people even managed to nuke themselves. None of it worked. Their burned, destroyed, bodies slowly regrew. It should have been impossible. But impossible seemed to have lost its meaning by now. 

Eventually, someone got a bright idea - unconsciousness! People were hit with tranquilizers strong enough to fell elephants and the results were monitored. Preliminary tests looked to be successful! Later, though, they were proven wrong. Eventually the tranquilizer lost its effect, and the patients rose again.

Then I was born. A secret child. An illegal child. A *blessed* child. When I was young, I accidentally stepped on a cricket. And it stayed dead. The first death in who knows how many years. It didn’t take long before people noticed, and suddenly I was famous - the new Death, the bringer of rest.

Killing is hard. Not so much mentally. It’s really more of a mercy now. It’s hard physically. I can’t kill them with any instruments, as that’d mean that something else killed them. I have to kill them with my bare hands. Strangle each one until the light fades from their eyes.

Maybe one day I’ll be free. But for now, I must do my duty. Hopefully I’ll be able to join them when my work is done.

I’m still pretty new at writing for these, so feedback would be appreciated.
