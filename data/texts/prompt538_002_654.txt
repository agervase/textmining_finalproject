I've burnt it in my memory. I can remember every single

fleck, every shadow, the shape of the iris. I catch myself

dreaming of those eyes - the lashes, the small laugh lines.

Everything.

&#x200B;

I've seen them on the third of every month since my

awakening at nineteen. Some awaken earlier, some later,

but never beyond thirty. Somewhere between thirteen and

twenty-nine, a couple in the world see the eyes that mirror

their hearts. Their souls. They yearn for it - hunger to

see them in reality. For six very long years, I have ached

to get to the third of the month, to see them again. The

pale green eyes with the violet flecks scattered within

them.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I will see them again. I will feel the warmth

of knowing that person is out there, waiting for me. I

will get up and go to work at Bethesda Memorial Oncology

Center, and see them again. I cannot wait for sleep tonight,

if I can find it.

I've made it to work. 45 minutes until I see those lovely

eyes. But first, I must see to my rounds. I've got a new

one today. Room 603. Let's see:

&#x200B;

Sarah Jehosephat

Age: 23

Height: 5'6

Weight: 107 lbs.

Type: Aggressive, Terminal.

Approximation: 6-10 months.

&#x200B;

As I scan quickly over the chart, I steel myself for

the meeting. The terminal ones are always tough.

Devastating.

&#x200B;

"Sarah, I see we have a round of chem..."

&#x200B;

Green eyes, violet flecks. My world stops. She looks up

and I know she knows. Those beautiful eyes fill quickly

with tears. 

&#x200B;

The chart clatters to the floor. My vision blurs with tears

of the theft of everything. The lump in my throat threatens

to choke the life from me. My tongue is thick, useless.

&#x200B;

The love of my life is dying. And I have ten months at

the most.

&#x200B;

And I only just met her.
