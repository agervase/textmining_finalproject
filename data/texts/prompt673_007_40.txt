She swallowed and let out a small sigh through her nose, trying to hold back the tears. “I’m tired.” A small ball of water escaped and ran down her cheek.

“As am I.” 

“How long will you last once I am gone?” She pressed him, feeling the cold start to creep in to her warmth. 

“Only a few moments.” 

The patch of grass that bloomed at her feet was becoming smaller with each outside piece shriveling and dying as his presence got closer. She looked down at the green and focused on its beauty. The simple plant that brought so much joy.  Grass; Children played in it, bugs danced in it, it was food for millions of creatures, homes were built out of it – it was one of her greatest creations. Just grass. Green, wild growing, thick and itchy grass. The way it felt soft on bare feet or the smell of it on a hot day. It’s resilience to grow. A “weed,” some might scoff, but not her. She saw only the desire to live, adapt, and grow. 

“We had fun, didn’t we?” She forged a weak smile and looked up at her partner. Tears falling from her eyes in confusion. 

“At times.” 

She paused again and looked out at the landscape where nothing but dust sat. “Will you miss me?” 

“Of course.” He said lightly, “without you I am nothing. Without you I would have had nothing.” 

“Will we meet again, you think?” 

“Perhaps.” 

He looked down at her with the same look he gave every other soul. Eyes scanned her soft skin gently. Kindness melted off of every word. He would miss her beauty. He would miss her breath. He would miss her gifts of natural disasters and he would miss her miracles. As with every creature, he would miss her and everything she brought to this world. But now it was his turn to give her a gift and that gift was rest.
