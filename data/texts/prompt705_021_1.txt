"Don't you think it's strange?"

"What's strange?"

"That the world hasn't ended yet. There's so many people in the world, surely one of them has met their doommate right?"

"Dunno. If there's so many people in the world, doesn't that make it harder to meet? I mean what are the odds of that happening anyways?"

"Well.. we can estimate it right? Take one person from each pair of doommates, the probability of that individual not ending the world is (1 - n/N), where n is the number of people they meet, and N is the total number of people in the world. Right?"

"Right... Well, surely its a bit more- ok fine, right."

"Now we take that probability for each person, which is half the world population, and we get the probability the world hasn't ended being (1-n/N)^(N/2). Now N is pretty big right, like 7 billion?"

"Right."

"So this probability comes out to be around e^(-n/2)."

"Uh.. I don't know how you got that but I'll trust you I guess?"

"You can prove it. So for n, how many people do you think you've met in your lifetime?"

"Hm... 100?"

"That's.. kind of depressing actually."

"Okay, uh 200?"

"Doesn't your school/workplace have more people you've talked to than that? Fine, 200 it is then. The probability of the world not ending comes out to be e^(-100) for that. That's 3x10^(-44). Vanishingly small."

"That.. certainly sounds small."

"You ever won the lottery?"

"Yeah! Actually just the other day, I got $12 off a scratchie."

"Scratchie? Never mind, that's not what I meant. You know like, a jackpot."

"Oh that? Nah. That's like what, a one in a million chance or something."

"15 million actually. Well the one I looked at. Imagine winning that 6 times in a row."

"Well didn't I see one the news that some lady had won a few times in a row actually? Wonder what happened to her."

"That's not the point! The point is that if doommates were real, we'd expect the world to have been destroyed a few times over already. But we haven't. So what does that suggest?"

"Wanna meet up?"
