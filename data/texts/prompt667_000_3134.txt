"Please, step into the pod when ready."


The AI instructed us on how to enter the hibernation process. We stepped into the upright pods and let ourselves lean back, preparing for a long sleep. No humans were present to monitor it. 


"Good night. Have pleasant dreams."


The doors of the pod automatically closed. People closed their eyes, but I didn't. The lights turned off and I was abandoned in darkness. I didn't fall asleep. 


I waited an hour. Maybe more. Then, I began screaming. I screamed until I couldn't scream anymore. It was all my worst nightmares at once. Dark, cold, alone, and without anyone even knowing there was a problem. I tried to calm myself. Shutdown Day is safe. There's never been any problems with it. 


I tried to move my arms to try to break the window, but I couldn't get them free. It's not like it would help anyway - I can't crawl out and there's no humans. Somebody else tried though - I heard the glass shatter. The AI spoke again, for the first time in the two days since we were put into the pods. 


"Please refrain from damaging the pods. It will be over soon."



"Let me out!" the man screamed. 


The AI went silent again, and it dawned on me. The hibernation process wasn't just meant to keep us asleep - why would it be? It was the genius solution to all of humanity's problems, and sleeping for a few centuries won't solve overpopulation, no matter how much data they give us. It was a temporary solution. 


What I realized while I died was that the conspiracy theorists were right. There are less people when we wake up.
