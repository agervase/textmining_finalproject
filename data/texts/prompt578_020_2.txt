The ship was already crashing towards endless doom. My companion shouting at me to do better. "Try that lever over there". I'm starting to get the idea this person shouldn't even be on this airship, or at least is not an experienced pilot to begin with. Could anyone get experienced in this line of work. Why did they let these things fly in the first place. Is it such a great thing to be somewhere else?

The airship is still losing height, not yet at a truly alarming rate. Still, losing height is not a good sign with these things. We can't seem to get the tail to come back up again, there must be a leak somewhere. "Go tend to the passengers and let me think for a second. I just need some time to fix this". Trying to get a hold of my voice whilst I try to get the personnel's focus on other matters. They might not know it yet but I do. There is a leak in the back I'm sure of it. We can't be losing this much altitude just by having slight technical difficulties. The crew told me they already hit one thunderstorm and another one is working it's way up here. Our chances grow dimmer with each little minute that passes by. I look to my left and I see a frightened captain staring at me blankly. "This shouldn't happen to our ships, not ours." His tone is throwing a shiver down my own spine. This is a man that is truly in shock, and he is the goddamn captain. "Get your shit together, I got brought here by mere chance to give you the fighting chance you need and may deserve or may not. But I'll be damned if I don't try my hard- **BANG!**

Halfway through my standard monologue I prepared over some time and experience there's a loud bang. My ears are ringing and we are losing even more altitude. Only this time the rate has gone up to a point that I can't do anything about it. It's only a matter of minutes now, if it isn't seconds. I look at my newly found compadre as he stares at me. I can see this disbelieve in his eyes, he hates me at this point. I quietly whisper: I'm sorry. For me it doesn't get easier. For me it's a hit or miss. I can't help them all, I can't do the impossible and I can't alter faith too much. This was bound to happen. Quietly I start tapping the steering wheel. tap-tap-tap.....tap. 

&#x200B;

There's a big white flash and I'm transported to where or whenever I need to be. I don't even know if I can stop doing this or even if I want to at this point. All I know is when I tap four times on any surface, there is someone who needs my help.
