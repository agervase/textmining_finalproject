‘Ok stay calm’ I say to myself. Immediately my mind starts rushing as my eyes dart all over the room, more questions bounce around my mind than I can comprehend. I run into the bathroom and press the top of the tap... ‘nothing?’

I start pushing all around the tap when it suddenly turns on. Confused I splash water into my face and think what world have I entered? I take a deep breath and then it happened. I know exactly how to find out what’s going on, being quite the movie buff my favourite hero’s always check the newspaper first. 

I run to the stairs (not getting in that elevator again) and race down them 2 at a time. I burst onto the NYC streets and immediately feel something is missing from my field of view. As my gaze wanders up I start stepping backwards. ‘They.. I can’t... where I-I-I...’ I grab the nearest passer by a woman in her early 20’s, headphones yet without any wires. That was the least of my worries ‘Where is it?’ I say, voice trembling. ‘What are you talking about?!’ She pushes me back and I land into a passer by knocking the coffee in his hands all over him. ‘Fucking asshole, just wait until Trump builds that wall to keep you spics away!’

My mouth dropped, I hadn’t experienced racism like that in nearly a decade. Suddenly I felt my mind turn, not being the comprehend what was happening around me. First the Tv’s, then the towers, now this? I burst out laughing first just to myself but then I was laughing at everyone else. This must be a joke, some elaborate prank everyone is in on. I stand up and dust myself off ‘don’t worry guys I get it.’ Then... Bang. An impact, everything went black. Ding! The doors opened. ‘Come on your missing the party!’ My girlfriend puts a pair of glasses that spell out 2000 onto me. Just a horrible dream... just a horrible dream.
