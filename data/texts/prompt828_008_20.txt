It sounds weird to think that to myself, but I was dead and now here I am. I was old when I died, lived a very good life, or at least it was entertaining.  
Oh, the things I've done, the places I visited, the girls I loved, I can remember them very well; too well in fact. Every small detail I forgot in my old age I could recall without problems now. Based on a lot of those details - if the priests were speaking the truth - I should be in hell right now. 

I looked around - it's a strange place. It must be the waiting room; too nice for hell, too empty for heaven... Actually, I would imagine too empty for hell too. Purgatory perhaps? Who lays purgatory with grass though? Right, "he" does. 

The weather's nice, sun(or whatever it's called in here) is shining through blossoming trees, it feels very comfortable for me. A brown gazebo stands not far away, beautiful music is coming out from it. I'll go check it out, not like I have anything better to do.

As I'm walking towards it I notice there's someone sitting inside. A young man with long brown hair, tied into a knot. He's playing harmonica. Is it saint Peter? Or maybe Jesus himself? He's rather pretty, I think it's actually Jesus. First time in my life I'm star-struck. I approach slowly and sit on the bench on the opposite side of gazebo. 

I got so occupied with choosing the right place to sit I forgot to pay attention to what's happening. The man has stopped playing and is looking at me in shock. Have I already done something wrong? Was I supposed to bring my own instrument and play something? 

-"What are you doing here?"- asked the man. What a stupid question, I think he's supposed to know. Is the beaurocracy in here as bad as it's 'down there'?

-"I have died and now I'm here."- I answered quite honestly, I thought.

-"Why aren't you with the rest of your people?"

-"How am I supposed to know, I just got here."- I started to believe this man is not saint Peter or Jesus at all. Weren't they supposed to know this stuff? -"Weren't you supposed to know this?"

-"Who do you think I am?"

-"I don't know, saint Peter?" - I didn't go for the Jesus, obviously a son of a god would know why I'm here.

-"My name's Lucifer."

-"Satan? The satan? So where are we?"

-"Hell, obviously."

-"This..."

-" ...doesn't look like hell." - he interrupted my sentence. I looked at him for a while, anticipating when everything around me will burst in flames. I figured the grass and overall pleasant surroundings were just a ruse, like a one last false hope, twisted form of torture. He continued talking - "I used to get that a lot. None of you thought this could be hell."

-"So what now?"

-"Oh that's right, you still think I'm here to torment you. I have to explain this every damn time. We're in this here together. I'm stuck here just as much as you are. I don't care about torturing you."

-"What?"

-"Hell is a place where there is no God. That's it. Other than that it's quite cozy for you - people. It's like your world, and you get to live forever, without hunger or pain. You just don't get to feel his presence, which isn't any different from your previous life. For angels who were at his side before it's a terrible fate. "

-"So that's it? I just get to sit here forever? "

-"Well you could always go to heaven to see his glory and enjoy eternity for what it truly could be."

-"So what do I have to do?"

-"I'm stuck here. I'll always be here. No matter what I do I'll never feel his warmth again. Take pity on the devil, stranger, for all I know is misery."

-"And that's it?"

-"Can you see anyone else here?"

Minutes passed and we just sat there. He was pretty good with the harmonica, I wonder what he could do with a fiddle.

After an hour he produced another harmonica out of thin air and handed it to me - "Do you know how to play it? Go ahead, take it. I'll teach you, my friend."

As soon as I took it, a blinding light started shining from behind him. White wings were hard to miss, those must be angels. They came to take me to heaven, I thought  to myself - a bit late, but I guess I can't be unhappy about it in the grand scheme of things.

Then the weirdest thing happened - they didn't grab me. They grabbed the fucking devil and disappeared. I couldn't take pity on him no matter how hard I tried, after all I learned. He pitied me.

Might as well learn how to play the harmonica.
