**“It’s funny ain’t it?”**

**“It is.”**

**“This cigar I’m smoking seems like a burning wet twig to the drunk midgets, the ugly midgets and the snooty pointy eared tall cunts....but they couldn’t know for shit the good feels you get from a whiff.”**

**“True that.”**

**“But not one of us has a fuckin’ clue how those tall cunts throw out fire from their hands, how the drunk midgets make weapons and armor that lets them tank motherfuckin’ grenades and how the ugly bastards still exist.”**

**“Give me a fucking second Ben, I’m almost done”**

**“Fine, but you’ve been trying to make that spell work for 2 years. You should stop wasting your time and try to get a better job, get settled with a woman,you know, like a normal person...Ed.”** Suggested Ben, refusing to give Edward the second he requested.

**“Mate, could you please for the love of god, shut yer trap?”** Said Edward very clearly annoyed, frowning whilst he rubbed off excess powder to make the spell shape precise and made slight adjustments to the candles.

A person with basic intellect would give Edward the space he needed, unfortunately intellect was one thing the beefy, hulking Ben was deficient in.

**“Do you actually think you could’ve gotten a fucking legit elven spell scripture? For fuck’s sake man we have 100’s of fucking museums of looted elven treasures and artifacts, but not a single fucking one of those scriptures. Don’t you think there’s a good chance you were scammed for your 30 silver?”** Exclaimed Ben, relentlessly.

Edward just about had it with Ben, after a groan he shouted **“BEN, FOR THE HUNDREDTH BLOODY TIME, SHUT THE FUCK UP!”**

Ben took a glance at his watch and said **“Fine! I’m running late anyway...oh god...Jennifer’s gonna kill me when she finds out I’ve been smoking.”**

Ben got up from the couch and took a final glance at Ed on the ground with his magic circle or what not. He strolled upstairs and wished Edward’s mom a good night. The Uber was conveniently a minute away. Ben slipped his feet into his worn loafers and announced he was leaving for Ed’s mom to shut the door. His ride was down the avenue, he walked down the road surrounded by serene green..

A few steps later, He heard a deafening explosion behind him. He turned around to see a pillar of fire jutting upward from Ed’s house. 

Three words came as naturally as breathing to Ben right there.

**“What the fuck...”** 

After a sudden change of tone and a half, the narrator said,

**“That’s when the goblins, elves and dwarves were fucked a full 360 degrees.”**

The bedtime story ended as a man barged into the kids room, sighed before saying

**“Dad, what did I tell you about cursing in front of the kids?”**

**“Old age...son, comes with a weak memory.”**he explained after which he announced **“It’s way past your bedtime kids, go to fucking sleep”**

The man gave a second sigh, this time with record breaking levels of disappointment.

His three children said **“Good night grandpa.”** as synced as a choir.

He rushed out after hugging his son. His phone began to ring, he answered the call by tapping his earpiece.

**“Greetings Mr.Benjamin, It’s a good thing you didn’t mention the government’s involvement.
The senate appreciates the gesture and promises not to dispose of you as long as you keep up the good work. Have a good night.”** a beep signalled the end of the call.

Ben’s hands were quivering as he realised how he nearly died.
