I was sitting in a small coffee shop reading the news. The world was pretty normal, other than a small industry of giving time travellers and immortals letters and a small commission to deliver letters into the future. But that had nothing to do with me.

A guy in a black trench coat, sunglasses, and fedora sat across from me. "You need to deliver this letter to the person sitting in this booth 50 years from now."

Me: "Cool... who the fuck are you?"

Guy: That doesn't matter. It is of critical importance that you deliver this letter.

Me: I might not even be alive then.

Guy: Yes you will, you are an immortal and a time traveller.

Me: Cool. I'm not though.

Guy: Yes you are.

Me: Like I said, I'm not. Maybe you got the wrong guy. Who are you looking for?

Guy: Norange the Orange

Me: Well problem solved. My name is Nick

Guy: Yeah but in 20 years, you will change your name to Norange the Orange.

Me: No I won't.

Guy: Yeah you will. See, here's a picture I have of you.

Me: Well... that's clearly not me. That guy's black. I'm not.

Guy: Not yet, but in 35 years you will have race replacement surgery. You'll do it so you can say the N word in public.

Me: No I won't.

Guy: Yeah you will. See, you have the same neck tattoo of Winnie the Pooh slapping Tigger.

Me:  ...I don't have that tattoo.

Guy: Not yet you don't, I'm giving it to you tonight.

Me:...no thank you?

Guy: I've already been paid for it.

Me: By whom??

Guy: Don't worry about it.

Me: I'd like to worry about it.

Guy: It's that guy behind you.

I turned around. Nobody was behind me. I turned forward again. The guy was gone and the letter was there. I decided to open it. It was an invoice for a tattoo.
