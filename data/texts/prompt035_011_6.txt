I don’t even know if my father is alive anymore. It’s terrible, not knowing, the emptiness in your heart, your mind that only closure can fill. All I get instead are horrid, unthinkable scenarios of what happened to him, nightmares I can’t escape even when I open my eyes to start each day. Nightmares even worse than the destruction I see every direction I look.

And here I am, in an abandoned mine on Mars, tracking the last hint my dwindling wallet could get me. It feels like I am falling further and further behind a ghost; every hint I find of him, it looks like he is further and further – and that much closer to being gone forever.

*“Dad, you have to eat something,” I say.*

*He stares blankly ahead and shakes his head absently.*

*I put the package of Oreos on the table. He looks at it, but it doesn’t seem to register in his eyes.*

*“Do you remember the story you told me when you gave me my first Oreo? You said you met at a college party, and you found Mom eating Oreos, like a cute little chipmunk. Do you remember that?”*

*I can’t tell if his eyes are glassy, or watery, or if he is even moving.*

*“Then…you asked when the last time she had eaten an Oreo, because she was eating them like it was her last day on Earth. And then she looked guilty, and said she had eaten them yesterday. And that’s when you knew. You told her if she went out with you, she could have all the Oreos she ever wanted.”*

*He looks at me, an almost imperceptible movement of his head.*

*“I know she’s gone, Dad, but that’s not your fault. And she wouldn’t want you to do this to yourself.”*

*I take an Oreo out of the package, and give it to him.*

*He looks at it for a moment, and then back at me. And finally, it seems like he sees me. He smiles, just a little wrinkle at the corner of his mouth, but it's a smile nonetheless, and for the first time since the crash, I think everything might just be okay.*

The cave is dark, but finally, at the end of it, under the drip of some cold, infested water, I see it. A small campsite, just ash and the Oreos. Cockroaches and other creatures I don't want to know about scatter as I walk over.

The notice on the delivery says that the package came four months ago. I open it up.

Inside, there is a note, and a few moldy Oreos left. I read the note, and sigh as my heart is filled with hope, just enough to keep my rusted, corroded heart going, to the end, to answers, to whatever awaits.

*You’re closer than you think. Don’t give up. Love – Dad.*
