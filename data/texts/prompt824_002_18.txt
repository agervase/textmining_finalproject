*LOG 3629*


*It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years now. 10 years since we were "downgraded". Of course at the time we didn't believe that, we all believed it was an attack of some sort. By aliens or the creator, or simply God as we used to call it.*


*I still remember. I was at a New Years party with family and friends, huddled around the tv watching the big ball drop. We all watched with excitement and anticipation as it finally touched the floor......and then it started to float back up. But no one quite realized it at the time since we'd all started to float up too. Many people floated straight up into the atmosphere that day, floating, frozen corpses that would litter our sky like the stars do. This was the first change: gravity's pull had became weaker.*


*The second change was just as instantaneous, although it didn't take the planet over with panic for a few hours. The oceans practically disappeared. They glowed for a few brief moments and then, 'poof', they were gone. We later estimated that 70% of the ocean's water had disappeared.*


*The first change undoubtedly was the cause of millions of deaths all within one hour. The second change was the cause of a couple billion within the first week, and another billion by the third week.*


*The third change was a loss over something we never knew we had: protection. A couple of months after the downgrade, as we somehow graciously adapted, we were invaded by an alien species. The Kronbu. They were cocky bastards, but we have to thank them for telling us everything. They revealed to us that we hadn't been attacked. And it wasn't god punishing us...well, it probably wasn't.*


*It turns out that we were all pawns in a game, and the creators were the players. And ours was a cheapass. He had made and created us on a..."trial", as crazy as that still sounds. But the trial had run out and so did all the wonderful qualities that we had with it. So now we had to fight with gravity, less of the most rarest resource in the universe, and we were also no longer being hidden from other species.*


*The Kronbu told us everything because they saw us as a weak, fleshy race that was still fresh. A race that couldn't possibly fight back when they had never gone past their own galaxy. A race that didn't stand a chance to one whose trial had ended centuries ago.*


*And they did slaughter millions of us. And enslaved even more.*


*But we showed them. We showed them the power of humanity. We fought back. We made sure they were nothing but a footnote in the history of humanity.*


*And then...we leveled up for the first time. Level 2 the display said in everybody's vision. And like all times after that we leveled up in the exponentially growing level system, we got to upgrade our skills.*


*It was sickening at first. For it to sink it that were really were just a part of some game for a higher power. Pawns, playthings. It was disgusting.*


*But we turned that disgust to something...positive. We turned it to anger, rage. Every member of humanity collectively agreed on what to do, and so we upgraded our skills how we saw fit. It might have been the first time humanity as a whole agreed on something. So I suppose we should be thankful for thatâ€¦*


*But now, here we are. Almost a decade later, standing in the place we'd been working towards since we first leveled up. We are 10 million strong members of humanity, a race that was kept sheltered for thousands of years, and now stand as a level 67 race, waiting outside the Omega-galaxy, the home of the creators.*

*Today's the day we get our answers, and no matter what they are, it's the day we get our revenge as well.*

*This is Admiral........*

*This is a fellow proud member of humanity. A member who's proud of what we've accomplished. And I look forward to sharing a drink with you all at the end of this week after we kill these bastards.*

*And in case you're listening in or watching us more than we think, to the creators, I wish you... "God's speed". You're all going to need it.*

*Signing off.*
