Dad,

I don't believe them.

What they told me makes perfect sense, hell I even remember when the President signed the Confession Act into law. But I know me better than anyone else and murder is something I am not capable of. Killing someone, sure if the conditions were right, but not murder. But, if it wasn't murder than why am I locked in here? Nothing makes sense.

I asked my lawyer again to show me my testimony despite knowing the law doesn't allow for that. He seems extremely sympathetic which is strange considering how reliable extracted memories are and his supposedly having first-person knowledge of what I did. There's just no way I killed her the way they said I did. Not the way they told me it happened. Jeremy said he'd visit next week but I doubt he shows; I think he actually believes I did it too. I know it's asking a lot but please ask him to not talk about the case to the kids.

I know you said you didn't want to talk about the case but seeing as how I've been convicted it's not really a case anymore so I thought it would be okay. Mostly I just need to write these thoughts down to help me think clearly until I can figure out what is going on. Things just don't add up. 

I did recover another memory this morning when I woke up. At first I thought it was a dream but now I'm sure it happened. But for the life of me, I cannot remember why in the world I was having lunch with Senator Whitmore. When I left his campaign in August I didn't think he had any interest in maintaining any relationship with me but he seemed eager. Please write back,

Julie
