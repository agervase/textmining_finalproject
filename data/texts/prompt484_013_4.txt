It was mid October, slightly before the "scariest" day on earth; Halloween. How fitting that the one time I actually *had* a costume, the world was going to end before I got to wear it. Not that people especially cared though, they were mostly focused on bucket lists, those things they all wanted to do before they died, **we** all died. It was too late for me though, we'd known about this for almost two years - A giant rock, a planet, floating lazily into us. I'd been a salesman at a pet shop before the announcement, I couldn't just leave them all though, so I stuck around for the first few months. Some people were upfront; "I've always wanted to try cat before". Disgusting. Eventually I gave up - just brought what was left back home. My landlord complained at first, but eventually he too left on his "World Tour", just never came back. Were planes even still flying these days? I'd be surprised.

Governments had tried to salvage something but mistakes, split budgets, worker shortage, had all made it impossible to really get a plan into action. I heard Russia sent up a shuttle to the moon, but nobody really knows much more than that, or at least nobody I talked to.

So here I am, home, surrounded by everyone that really mattered to me. How depressing. I closed my eyes for the final time; a final cat nap before the end of the world.

I looked at my clock - 3:43pm

"That's a bit strange" I said aloud. It was probably at this point that I realized my apartment was a bit more quiet than I'd ever heard it. My words hung in the air, a small echo.

No Squawks. Meows. Barks. These were normal sounds. These sounds were not there.

It was when I reached for my door-handle that I noticed the text - "however long it takes, save us" - in comic sans. Cute.

At first I wasn't really sure what to do. I could interact with anything, pick it up, move it around, I could more-or-less will something to normal. Or the weird state of normal I was in.

The first few days were mostly testing. How many objects, people, things, could I keep going at once, could I force something back into time-lock, did other people know what was going on?

More or less, it looked like 1 person at a time, or infinitely many objects, or at least as close to infinity as smashing that bottle of change on my dresser. Had to be like, 100 bucks in there of just pennies and nickles.

Anyway. The president didn't know what was going either. Frankly he asked too many questions for my liking. It's a shame I didn't have a girlfriend, probably would have made for better company then the current scientist I'm working with.

Andrew. The first one that didn't scream when I unfroze him. Very cool, calm. So far he's only asked me the important questions, he's been the perfect helper. He and I are re-building the Saturn V rocket. He's apparently a pretty big rocket buff and this is the one he likes the most. I'm learning a lot just by working with him, but I can tell that this is going to be a long process. Good thing I've got all the time I need! I looked at my watch again today. Bad habit. 3:43pm. Of all the objects I work with everyday, I leave this one just as it is, a reminder of the work I need to complete.

A few months, years, decades, pass by uneventfully. We've got most of the parts here, and for the things we don't, we collect. The drives are probably the longest part of this. One time I forgot a couple very *particular* washers a few states over. I'm human, you know, I make mistakes. Well without them Andrew wasn't going to be able to keep going. He ended up coming with me "in case we needed anything else". Ha. He ended up just complaining the whole way there. But he was Andrew, my only friend in this "world". I could have just frozen him, just for a few minutes of silence, but it seemed to me that I probably deserved it.

Either way, after a few more decades, it was upright, in place, and ready to launch.

I'm not really sure why we built a space faring vessel instead of a missile, but Andrew said we could just bring a payload with us. Made sense. I'm not really a thinker though.

Really though, of all the people on this planet, they choose me. Why not someone like Andrew? Hell he's basically handling this on his own anyways, I'm just the mojo for him to be not-as-frozen-as-everyone-else.

Andrew snapped his fingers in my face. "Hey" he grinned. "We're all loaded up, 10 of the largest warheads known to mankind. Let's get this rocket a movin'"

I took one last look at the rocket. She was ugly as sin. Mismatched metal made for atmospheric exit only; this was a one way trip for us. The unknown saviors of the planet. I thought about leaving a note or something, but it's not like they could praise me. I chuckled. I guess I'm a benevolent god.

As I strapped myself to the chair and flicked open the cover on the initiate button, I looked over to Andrew. "Are we really going to land this ship on the planet and **then** blow it up?"

"It's the only way to be sure they go off in the right spots, you know that. You're the one who has to set the timer and then unfreeze them."

I shrugged "I just thought it would be more *spectacular* or something."

"You're sitting in a 40 year old rocket, on your way to an unknown planet in space, with over 400 megatons of explosive material on a stopwatch, and nobody will ever know. Spectacular is an understatement."

I pushed the button.

Surprisingly, everything happened exactly as it was supposed to. Andrew had made meticulous checks and re-checks of everything. It was a straight shot thankfully, and the small deviations we're all handled by the computer. We arrived to it just shy of a day later.

Stepping out onto the planet was...different. It had more gravity than I thought it would. The ground was solid, clear. It was like walking on a garden path rather than on a pile of dust like I expected. I suppose it was flying through space, so maybe it got dusted off? I barely understood how rocket fuel worked and I spent 6 months making the stuff. I shrugged. Not like it really matters.

I grabbed the first bomb and loaded it up onto the wheel assembly. We'd found a few cavern entrances on the surface where we wanted to land. A stationary target is pretty easy to hit.

I walked into the first cave, with Andrew driving the little rover, it was a tight fit, but we were confident that the tunnel was our ticket to drop-zone 1.

The cave on the other hand, had no such predication. Each time we found a suitable spot, we decided that they could be a better one just ahead. We had time, so why not? I stumbled. The clear pathway I had been walking for almost an hour suddenly had a rock on it. It was so out of character for the uniform...ish... cave that this was the first real rock I'd seen so far. I picked it up. Is that...Moss? Space Moss?

Andrew was as surprised as I was when he took a look. Nothing he'd ever seen before. We elected to scout ahead. If there was moss here, then maybe we'd get the rover stuck if we went to far forward. We only had one, so it was important to keep it going.

The further we went, the thicker the moss got. Wall, ceiling, it didn't matter. I saw a light up ahead, but not natural light. It had a purple hue to it. Andrew suggested bio-luminescence. Sure. Lets go with that.

We reached the purple light, but it wasn't anything like we expected. In fact, it was a button that said "Push". Written right there. In English. On the surface of a planet nobody had ever been to before. In Comic Sans. I did what any self-respecting human would have done. I pushed it.

A door slid open and the purple light increased. We turned off our lights and stepped in.

In the center of the room lay a floating ball of light - honestly it looked like something out of Star Trek. The room was circular, with little benches on the walls gradually climbing to the ceiling. Tiers and tiers of them. Movement caught my eye. That was a strange sensation.

Wait. Movement?

I looked at Andrew, and he was clearly there, right in the spot where he was 10 seconds before. I looked back. Two little eyes peeked over one of the upper benches. I didn't really know what to do. Something in those eyes reminded me of an animal, a domesticated cat or dog perhaps. I shook my head. I must be seeing things.

"Are you here to save us? We have been waiting"
