**0700 - March 29, 2022**

The Oval office stands packed with high-ranking officials and men in black suits. An aide walks up to the President, handing over a situation brief. 

The aide cleared his throat, "Mr. President, at 0300 today, we received a message from SETI. They have picked up a message which was sent from deep space using a binary code." 

"Were they able to translate the message?" the President asks. 

"Yes Sir, the message reads as follows: "Greetings, Colony 037. We are glad to see you survived. The others all ran out of resources. May we come over? Message ends."

"Have we communicated with other world leaders yet? It seems like something this important should be decided by more than just us right?" asked the heretofore unmentioned Secretary of Defense. 

"Are you crazy man? We are American, we don't consult with foreign governments unless we have something to gain. No, this is an important step for the world, and I want that step to be taken soley by American legs!" said the President, star spangled banner waving dramatically behind him. 



"Well, now that's taken care of, we need to respond. Do we know how long ago the message was sent? Do we know how long it would take to return a message?" asked the President. 

"Sir, we're not sure how the aliens would like us to respond. All we know for now is the general direction the message came from. The distance it traveled is currently unknown. We have considered sending a similarly coded message broadcast back in the direction it came." said the aide. 

"Well then, I suppose we should consider this properly." the President leans forward and steeples his fingers, "This is a first contact scenarioâ€”we have no idea what these beings consider to be an insult. We'll send back a general message of peace, thank them for the well-wishes. We should accept their offer to visit, to do otherwise risks the first inter-planetary incident."

"Right away Sir, I'll get the boys at NASA and SETI on it immediately. This is a proud day to be an American, Sir." 

**0800 - March 30, 2022**

"Sir, the return message has been written. It reads: Thank you for taking a positive interest, we have survived rather well, thank you. If you would like to stop by, don't hesitate. End message," the aide said, slightly embarrassed. 

"This is the best message our brightest minds could come up with in 24 hours? Frankly, I'm disappointed," said the President rather harshly. 

"Well Sir, we determined that a casual response had the highest chance of being received favorably. Besides, the person writing this only really spent about 5 minutes writing the entire thing. He didn't have 24 hours, that's all I'm saying," said the aide, his voice rightfully defensive.

"Well, I suppose that makes sense. Are we prepared to send the message?" asked the President. 

The aide looked gratified, "Yes Sir, and I'm sure the writer would be happy to hear you say that. The message is currently on standby. Awaiting your orders Sir."

"Very well, send the message. This is a proud day for America, and therefor the World," the President intoned, self important. 

With that, the message was sent. 

"Well, I suppose all there is to do now is wai-" the President's words were cut off by a glowing pillar of light appearing in the center of the office. As the light faded, they could make out a ragged looking man in his late twenties. 

Stepping forward, he reached out his hand towards the seated President. For his part, the President stood and solemnly walked forward, grabbing the hand of the traveler. 

"Hey man, I'm Florin Elbis. Nice to meet you. Do y'all mind if my people land? We need somewhere to crash for a while," said the ragged looking man. The President was getting the distinct feeling this kid was a hippy. 

"How do you even speak our language?" asks the aide. 

"Oh, the standard writer's cop out, universal translator," he said. 

"Ah, that makes sense... Now, how many people were you talking about?" 

"Man, only a few. You'll hardly even notice them man." The President was feeling slightly off about this whole thing. 

"I suppose, if there are only a few....In the interest of good relations, I will accept,"

Just then, over 10 billion pillars of light crackled into life all over the United States. The President's phone soon vibrated and cried out with texts, emails, and phone calls. 

When he fully realized the scale of the visitor's delegation, he hung his head. "They almost hanged me because of the 'refugee crisis'... I have no idea what they'll do to me now."

He wondered idly how it was that the other colonies ran out of resources...
