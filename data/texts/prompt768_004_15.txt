The first time I used my powers was when I didn't even know it existed. 14-year old me decided to joke with the studious girl sitting in front of me by tapping on her shoulder jokingly mid-lesson. I was shocked momentarily when she turned around instantly, accompanied with an annoyed "What?" She was the type of girl who never tore her eyes away from the whiteboard until the lesson ended. I thought she turned around and forsook learning for me. That led to my confession a month later, and her swift rejection. The pain in my heart lasted for a long time.

I was reminded of my power again when I was 16. I tapped my buddy's shoulder one day, intending to alert him of an oncoming car behind us. But he turned around without hesistation, saw the car and hurried to the curb. "Thanks man" and a pat on the back was my reward. And my suspicions were aroused.

Over the course of the next year, I explored the use of my powers. I proved its existence to my family when their heads snapped backwards at my touch. After my initial joy at discovery, I realized how utterly useless the power was. Sure, it was funny. And I utilized it as well as I could, tapping a classmate's shoulder to make the teacher think he was talking. And they were pretty hilarious. But I finally found a use for it, one magical September night.

I was dating a girl for a year then. We were both 18, studying in the same university. That night, as she admired the stars, I positioned my face behind her and tapped her shoulder.

As soon as she turned around, my lips were there to meet hers. And like the many young couples of this century, we were locked in a passionate kiss.

She broke it at last, throwing her arms around mine as she clutched me tightly. "I'll never let you go," was all she had to say. The scar in my heart from 14 was finally healed.

Then I found my second power.

As she hugged me, I wrapped my arms around her, patting her shoulders slowly. "Nor will I," I replied.

No reply met me. Only a slumping of her body.

"Julia?" No response.

"Julia??" her body dislodged from mine, limply falling to the ground.

"JULIA!"
