"Look, the next time she texts - just don't reply immediately. You'll come off as desperate" Lust said

Eric stared at his phone. Stared at the message he'd fired off, glared at the "sent" symbol, and winced at how long it had been since he had sent it. **30 minutes.**

"Double Text her. Show to her you don't give a FUCK. Look dude you know she wants it, otherwise why else would she be texting you at all?" Pride said.

Eric looked at Pride and considered what he said for a moment.

"She's probably just busy" Envy said, shrugging. "Out of all the guys at the party, you're the only one who got her number. They probably hate you, oh wait I made sure they did lol"

"Yeaaaaah dude, I was wing-manning you the whole night" Sloth said laying on the floor, not opening his eyes. "Not a single dude came close, I made sure of it ha."

Eric sighed. They were right, he was worrying over nothing.

**BAM**

"WE'LL KILL THAT BITCH IF SHE DOESN'T SAY YES TO THE DATE" Wrath said entering the room and shotgunning a beer. On the new rug.

"Wrath man, you needa chill and smoke a bowl" Sloth said, unfazed by Wrath's outburst.

"THE HELL WITH THAT, WHERE'S MY COKE?" Wrath replied, looking around the room

"I flushed it down the toilet" Lust said

"YOU FLUSHED A KILO!?!?" said Wrath

*A whole Kilo. Fuck.* Eric thought

"You really didn't need it!" Envy chimed in.

"Motherf- WE. ARE. THE. 7. **DEADLY**. SINS! Last I checked we weren't THE FUCKING GIRL SCOUTS!" Wrath yelled

"Look around Wrath" Pride said "I really don't see why we need to be DEADLY right now, or why you need coke so badly, you're doing just fine without it"

"Screw this man" Wrath said, leaving the room. "I'm gonna make my **OWN** 7 DEADLY SINS! With Blackjack! and Hookers!"

"I was beginning to think he'd never leave" Gluttony said, walking in with a pizza. "You want a slice Eric?"

"Nah I'm good. Thanks though." said Eric. "I was ju-"

Ding.

Everyone's heads turned to the phone. A text from the girl.

Eric's sweaty palms opened the text.

>Friday at 7pm? I'm down, I've always wanted to go watch the sunset at Crystal Lake

The room cheered. Eric got the date!

Lust hugged Eric and squealed. "I HAVE THE PERFECT OUTFIT FOR YOU"

Pride clapped him on the back. "We're going with you of course, to make sure it goes smoothly"

Gluttony chimed in: "I'll make you two a picnic basket, it'll be straight fire man"

Eric looked around at everyone and, for once, didn't feel as sad anymore.



I mean, what could possibly go wrong on Friday the 13th?
