I strolled into Mac's tavern, recoiling from the frosty air outside. I sat down at my usual stool, two down from the jukebox. The bartender poured me a whiskey straight, neat, and plunked it down in front of me. As I lifted up the glass, something in the reflection caught my eye. 

She sauntered into the tavern and leaned against the bartop. I looked on in rote admiration, at once entranced and fascinated by her beauty. Clicking long black nails, she waited patiently for the bartender to arrive. "What'll you have?" "Vodka. Straight. No ice." The man looked her up and down with disgust, and grumbled out something equivalent to "my pleasure." 
I took a sip of my drink, emboldened by her close proximity to mine. "Excuse me, miss, what are you doing in these parts?" 
The woman tilted her head slightly, pulling a piece of sinuous hair back from the nape of her neck. She answered in a deep husky voice, "I had nothing better to do, I'm drawn to these parts." As soon as she spoke, I felt goosebumps as the room became noticeably colder.
She leaned back on her stool and extended her wrist to me. "Haven't we met before? You seem familiar."
"Darling," she added, "you've been flirting with me for years." She wrapped her arms around me and the last thing I remember was feeling her two icy lips on my mouth...

"NICK!" "Nick, oh my god. Oh my god, he's awake!"
Light flooded my senses. All around me were sounds and noises not quite distinguishable. I felt the prick of an IV pulsing through my veins, and the stupor of brain fog from pain medications. Besides me, my two teammates rejoiced that I was alive: I had sustained serious injuries from my mountain bike crashes over the years, but none were so special as those that brought me back to death, my most beautiful companion.
