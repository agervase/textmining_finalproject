The Buddha picks up the gun sitting on the floor of the passenger seat, he takes a long breathe in and out. 

 “Black implies white, you can’t have without the other. It’s simple. What was so hard about keeping this balance then, Satan?!”

Jesus looks back at us, “Yeah man, even God’s upset.”

Satan gives an incredulous look. “Wait, Big Daddy up there is mad about there being more goodness in the world?”

Everyone is unison says “Yes!”

 “You guys are twisted” 

The Buddha leans his head out the window and aims at a flying robot speeding towards the car. He fires a succession of shots before it falls down to the earth. 

“Look Satan,” I say, “The council has had a change of plans. We realized what all this altruism entails for humanity, so we want to help. We don’t want them going extinct.”

Jesus pipes in, “In actuality, God just doesn’t want to have to compete with the super intelligent AI humans are building. We need them to start focusing on biological evolution again, not technology.”

 “All you have to do is tweak the nature of human hearts a little so they can lean towards patriarchy, authoritarianism, sexism, racism. You know things like that. So what do you say?”

Satan in a serious tone only replies with “No”

 “But I didn’t even tell you about all the benefits-“

 “I said no, and that it.”

The others stir up. 

“What?!” 

 “I told you guys that we shouldn’t have saved this good for nothing asshole,” Jesus murmurs

 “Jesus!” The Buddha exclaims, “You cursed.” 

 “Oh I’m sorry.” Jesus says with a pout. “And Satan, I didn’t mean to say that. You’re not an ass, you were made in the image of God, and are lov…”

 “Please, just shut up!” I shout, “We need to figure this out.”
