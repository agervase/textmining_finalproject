Late to the party, here goes. I have substituted "wrath" for "anger" for the sake of meter.

#The Wrath of a Gentle Man#

---

    When I was still a youth my father said
    The hour draws near
    to teach you, as my father did, those things 
    all wise men fear.

    The ocean vast, majestic, calm, the thoughtful 
    heart keeps warm,
    But wisely clings to safety's shore in tempest
    and in storm.

    The moonlit night restores the soul, whether
    you wake or sleep,
    But 'pon new moon what evil tracks its ways
    in darkness deep?

    Still worse than these, the wise man knows, it's pow'r
    he can't withstand:
    Do not awake, do not arouse
    the wrath of a gentle man.

    Th'unending depths, the vast expanse the sailor
    hoids these dear.
    With rope and sail and oar in hand, he conquers
    every fear.

    But when the waves do toss and break and rake
    him o'er the coals,
    The wise man seeks the harbor's calm, avoids 
    the wrecking shoals.

    Still though how mount'nous are the crests, how low the
    valleyed troughs,
    The wise man fears more'n ocean storm and leaves it
    lie far off.

    Poseidon's rage may splinter ships, and hopeless
    sailors strand,
    But fearsome'r still than crashing waves
    is the wrath of a gentle man.

---

    The hunter has no fear at nighttime when 
    the moon is raised.
    No friend nor foe, no prey nor snare escapes
    his piercing gaze.

    But when the moon hath hid its face, the dark path
    he doth shun:
    The wise man tarries not at night, while shadows
    lengthening run.

    But still preferred is moonless night, all trackless,
    wand'ring, lost,
    The wise man knows that other fears may fetch
    a dearer cost.

    The hounds of hell may howl and bay within that
    trackless stand,
    But fearsome'r still in the dead of night
    is the wrath of a gentle man.

---

    The darkened night, the raging storm, strike fear
    in wisest heart,
    If length of days be yours, my son, avoid them
    for your part.

    But peace, for only nature's whims are dangers
    such as these;
    Let not the troubles of this kind your arms
    t'inaction seize.

    Betrayal by friend, thy foe's keen sword, o'er these
    the wise prevails.
    And nature's strength the wise man turns and of it's
    pow'r avails.

    But though he toil, though he prepare, no matter
    what his plan,
    Even the wise man can't survive
    the wrath of a gentle man.
