Sigh....


“John.”

“Yeah.”

“You can explain.”

“Yeah.”

“Magic Powers?”

“No.”

“Super Science?”

He looked up. 

“Deep Maths.”

“Oh... wait, really? Just math?”

“Yeah.”

“Huh...”

“You okay?”

“Uh... wha..? I... I mean it’s kinda rough out and about right now.”

“The computation should be done soon.”

“The what!?”

“It’s pure math in reality. I think Ghengis Khan probably grasped it on an instinctive or intellectual level. The Brits has it figured out for awhile.”

“You control the world with math. Math dragged me out of my bed in my supposedly secure, secluded house in the middle of the night without setting off any of my booby traps or waking me up?”

“I cheated on that one.”

“...what.”

“Well... not really cheated. But...”


*blinks slowly

“I had to come get you myself, cause you probably wouldn’t kill me if you half woke up when we can to get you.”

“Oh...”

“And it’s Math. The concept. Not just numbers. You can see the world move, adjust accordingly, and offer the right fix at just the right time.”

*more blinking

“I’ve lost you.”

“Dude, I just figured out that my buddy, Johnny Go-get-me-some-god-Damn-Flim-flam-Hootenhanny-Apple-Whiskey-if-your-bow-legged-yellow-lilly-White-asinine-butt-calls-Me-Apple Seed”

*cough “In public no less”

*eyebrow twitch “Is the leader of the world. Purportedly having killed, jailed, intimidated, all without doing anything. It all just happened.”

“Yeah. Well, kinda. I’m still John.”

“You are?”

“Well yeah!”

“Uh... I thought your sister was the one who with more megalomania tendencies.”

“She probably is, but she’s living on a small ranch with her partner. She helped with some consulting early on, but she really doesn’t care to run this stuff. ‘Too much theatre’ she said.”

“You didn’t get hit by a smart ray? No super science, magic, smart serum, ancient plant mixture?”

“You’d know more about that than me, Cellarman.”

*gasp 
“In public no less!”

“Cool it, Ebenezer.”

*surprised blink

“I read the Evil Overlord List.”

“You what?”

“I. Read. The. Evil. Overlord. List.”

*cue a minute of blinking, eyes narrowing, eyebrows flailing, and multiple facial expressions

“So Math, capital M, for some reason, the Evil Overlord List, and... the Internet? Memes?”

“No! No one can control the Memes! That’s like trying to eat blackholes without Maple Syrup!!! No. Nooo. No.”

“I just thou-“

“No you didn’t! Memes can’t be contained! It’s like nuclear weapons.”

“Hey wait.”

“What?”

“You are John.”

“You believe me... Now? What changed?”

“Nuclear, not Nukleuhar.”

“Well. Damn.”

“So you’re playing Civ: Real World Edition?”

“Do you Math?”

“Do I What?”

“Do you Math?”

“I can do some adding and such. Most of the high level stuff beyond basic college eludes me these days.”

“You run a-“

“What.”

*silence

“I run a What.”

“You run a bar.”

“And.”

“You run a bar and B&B&B.”

“Bed and Breakfast and Beer. Yup. That’s all I do.”

“I know.”

*Silence

“I needed you in your professional capacity.”

“Oh. Why didn’t you call?”

“What?!”

“It’s John. I always have time for my Johnny boi.”

“Oh... “

“Of course”

“Well, I took over part of the world anyway, so we might as well continue to fix things.”

“We?”

“Oh, me and the other supreme leaders. They’re who I wanted to have dinner with. You’re always booked up, you never answer your phone!”

“John... we talked last week. You said you were good.”

“Well, a lot can happen in a week.”

“You became the Supreme Leader in a week?”

“I just fixed a rounding error and it opened up Math to me.”

“You sound like you’re talking about the Matrix.”

“Very well, Mr. Anderson. If that is what you need to use to understand.”

“You don’t have the hair to pull if Smith. The bald kid, maybe.”

“Heh.”

“Math though.”

“You use it.”

“What?”

“You know, in the deep ce-“

*growls “What. Deep?”

“Nothing. But you get the long term changes and plan for them adoringly, with choices, right? You told me that years ago.”

“Well, yeah, read it in a book.”

“So. Bigger, and more varied, and focused on other things, like weather and geopolitics, food rations.”

“Uh... that’s how you control the world.”

“It’s gonna take awhile to explain, bud. That’s why I wanted to book a table.”

“Oh. Well... you could have called.”

“I know, buddy, I know. But would you have believed me?”

“Yeah, probably.”

“Well... damn. Guess I’ll get you home then. Have some knockout gas. It’s really solid stuff.”

“What! John! I don’t need to-“

*Thump

“My people will call your people, it’ll be less grabby. I’ll send a nice fruit basket. Maybe some honey.”

“Dammit maahhhn”

“See you bud!”
