"Hey, I'm Michael Battle from BET here with an exclusive interview with MC Christmas. Christmas, your record sales are through the roof, how do you manage to keep it fresh?" He asked. 

"Well you see, and hear my voice, I was cursed by a leprechaun and have no choice. To be quite honest I wish I was free, but a possibility of that happening isn't something I see." MC Christmas said. 

"Uhhhhh.. Right. Are the rumors true that you're hiding 2pac and Biggie Smalls-"

"Get off my balls. You'd think someone taking over your life would be big and tall, but the truth is the most evil package can be really small. You look uncomfortable perhaps you'd rather call?" A noticeably miserable man wearing a gold clock around his neck, and a face that looked 60 years old despite only being 22. 

MC Christmas was partying with some friends a few years ago. They were all getting high on mushrooms.  MC Christmas, formerly known simply as Chris Hagen, and another name in another life, got the bright idea to follow a rainbow looking for leprechauns gold. He assumed he was hallucinating when he found it, and decided to make the best of this powerful hallucination and bring it home. 

That same night at midnight a leprechaun-

"Um.. MC Christmas, you do realize you were just staring off into space telling me about a leprechaun who cursed you. [Inaudible speaking followed by a crackling sound]"

*It is in my professional opinion that this man spends the rest of his natural born life in psychiatric care. As you heard on the tape, he believes he is a famous rapper who was cursed by a leprechaun forcing him to only be able to speak in rhyme.*

*However, some part of him knows that isn't true, as made evident by him "interviewing himself. My diagnosis is acute insanity.*

*I do believe this man is capable of harming himself or others, even if that's his mother, father, sisters and brothers... Fuck.*
