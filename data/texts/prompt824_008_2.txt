That was it. 

The product of all humankind's science efforts poured in one big project, we really, really needed to know. 
That's why, with a budget of over 95 billion dollars, an unprecedented collaboration between all of our space agencies, some brilliant guys like Brian, and under the administration of a newly formed coalition, the EEW probe was on it's way. 

Way under budget and right on schedule. Man you've got to love the chinese for their efficiency and manufacturing capabilities. 

General Zhing, the figure behind all of this had this slight smile, a smile I had never had, one of completion, of a task well done. He was ready to launch. We were ready to launch. Brian sat at his workstation, he, being an avid gamer, or screen-tapper as I like to call them, could not be bothered to pay attention, and I wonder why, least this is **his** baby, the EEW's Imaging systems where entirely designed by his team, he was the one that came up with the idea, and it was he who spoke up in the UN, it was he who convinced all of the nations to give the go ahead on this project, based on some math and algorithms and stuff I cannot understand. 

"Low-key scan interferometry with some extrapolated data from the WMAP and both Deep Filed missions, that's all we need." What they've told to me, is that this guy was going to be able to design a machine that could peek into the first nano-seconds **before** the big-bang. 

Launch went well, we had lunch with Zhing and my bureaucratic mates, we asked Brian to come along, although the language barrier was there, it was broken down by the incredible Arab cuisine of my favourite place, Allewhas kebab. Not that spicy, perfectly roasted meat and amazing almond rice. 

Nevermind, the food is another story on it's own, enjoyed it. Period. 

Cue 6 months later. At his workstation, Brian was coordinating the string of commands to be sent to the probe, there was some delay between our very expensive toy and Earth's L3 point, where the probe was sitting, waiting. 

When confirmation of the booting up sequence was achieved, we were cheering up, clapping and hugging, Just two more months until we're good to go.

Three months go by, EWW's set to begin downstreaming data in a couple hours, in the meantime, the mission has sent us incredible images; blobs of plasma, great voids in between, kind of like swiss cheese they told me, for me they're just blobs of images and colors, truly i could not tell this apart from a satellite image of a hurricane, but that's why those people are here, to do the science. 

I'm told, over briefings, that we had proved right the Multiverse, whatever the fuck that is, and that Dark Matter and Energy are something (really?) and that we are going places with the data, all I can care is about how much it's still going to cost. 

We were all gathered around a big screen, a big reveal. The aforementioned image, the clue to the Universe, our existence was being downloaded as everyone gathered their champagne glasses before the press conference. 

"To continue, please upgrade from the Universeâ„¢ lite to our Pro version" 

It's going to cost a LOT, congress will not be pleased.
