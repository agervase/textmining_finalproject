The first unfortunate soul to encounter what come to be remembered as "The Beasts" was the captain of a small crawfish trawler.

The machinery pulling the nets on the red, rusting ship began to groan in agony louder than the captain had ever experienced. The ship began to tip as whatever was on the other end weighed the lines down, until finally one last burst of the diesel engine brought it over the edge of the ship. The captain ran down to it, spindly weathered legs hopping and skipping as fast as they could.

&#x200B;

But instead of the promises of gold or mountains of crawfish, a great ugly mass of oozing flesh and gelatinous shape under piles of river muck slowly rose up. At it's full height, it could be easily 10 feet; however, it was hard to tell if it had a spine to reach there. What could be certain was that it had a mouth, that opened to bellow a spine chilling screech putting the diesel engine to shame.

"Dang it," the old captain rushed back to the cabin and started digging around. Boney, scared fingers curled around a trusted friend with only a little bit of dust on it.

He whipped around the same time the Beast noticed him. No time to think about the size difference between the gun and it's target, the captain shot off 2 shells in quick succession.

&#x200B;

The Beast let off a scream that seemed to ripple through its self, oozing further from the now missing chunks. It tried to slide away, desperate to return to the safety of the water, but the Captain was too quick. Another two shells quickly found their way to whatever part of it controlled its actions. The Beast now rested much more soundly on the deck of the ship.

The Captain barely paused. If you knew the Captain, you knew that he had seen his fair share of oddities while trawling this stretch of the river. You would also know that the Captain wasn't a very educated man. Preferring the practicalities of work over ancient mythology.

However, everyone soon would become an expert, whether there was any merit to that claim, as more and more Beasts rose from the deepest slumber to a very different and very armed world.
