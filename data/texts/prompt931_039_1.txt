Last year's Hitler killing was crazy, I can't believe I won!  Most people won simply by killing Hitler using the wackiest or most creative method they could conjure in their sick, twisted minds...  Some say I went a little too far, having no care for myself or for general human feelings during the whole process, but it was for the competition!

So the first step, I used our modern gender swapping machine, I figured that any amount of time would do, but just to be safe I set a decent amount of time, ehh... sixteen years?  It was a long time to most people, but hell, we were time travelers, we don't give a damn about time!

Anyways, I went back in time, admiring my new slender, curvy body, assuming the guise of a woman wasn't exactly something I was used to, having done it only a few other times in the past.  There was one thing I just could not get used to... those damned women's shoes.  How the hell do they walk in those things?  Stumbling about, I managed to get to Adolf's location just in time.  He was in my sights!  

As I was walking towards him, trying to give off as much womanly appeal as possible, a thought struck my mind, I hadn't even come up with a name yet!  I stumbled for words as the future Fuhrer stared right at me, clearly stricken by my looks.  He walked towards me, my lips still quivering for words, what should I say, what should I say?!?!!

"May I get your name...?"  He muttered in a very fluent German, it was hard to recognize him at a young age knowing that iconic image, but it was him alright.  Without thinking, I reached out my hand, grabbing his and shaking it, which was... Uncommon, to say the least, among women, muttering a name that just came off the top of my head...

"Eva Braun!"  I shouted...
