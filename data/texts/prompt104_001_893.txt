"So is this a novelty penny? Where did you get it?" She asked, thumbing the copper piece back and forth in her hand. 

"I…er…yeah. It is." Daniel didn't quite know what to tell her. When he found the penny out on the sidewalk earlier that day, he couldn't quite believe it was real - and if he couldn't, his fiancé certainly wouldn't. "It is a bit…" She glanced up at him, and raised her eyebrow. "Egotistical?" 

The penny certainly was. Daniel's face featured front and center, with a big smile reminiscent of a 60's propaganda poster. That's not what worried him, however. Enscribed in a circle around his face was the phrase: *United American Empire - 2044 - Unity through Strength.*

"Yeah, yeah…I suppose." He mumbled. She placed the penny carefully back into his palm. "Right, I'm going to run to the toilet - I'll be back in a few." She stood up, and with that, Daniel was left alone in his living room. *American Empire…Unity through Strength…*what did it all mean? Was he going to...become...somebody someday? A leader? *The kind of leader who puts himself on the penny…who changes the countries name...what, am I going to lead a coup?* He thought. *What the hell is going on?* He was sweating. This was all far too much for him to handle. He'd always been interested in politics, but he'd never…would he?

"No." He said aloud. "Absolutely not." Maybe if he was assertive, knowing and saying what he wanted, the future would change - and it would all be fine. But the penny stayed still in his palm, unchanged - his aged face still smiling up at him. "No." He repeated. He glanced up, and looked out the window. Cars whizzed by on the street in front of him. 

He clamped his fist around the penny and stood up. 

"Never."
