The mist spread to unveil a familiar figure. As it drew closer, it grew more unfamiliar. The person stood steps away from me, mangled and bruised. Its eyes were closed, with scars on its arms. The man looked at me dead in the eyes. 

"Who... are you?" I asked.
"I am you."

I stood puzzled. I did not recognize the person in front of me. This person who I saw could not be me, I knew who I was. I am a strong person, molded by the hardships of my life. 

"No, you're not me. I took better care of myself. We don't look alike."
"Oh, but we are. We are the same person. I am the reflection of your life."
"What are you talking about? I lived a good life, married, kids, and worked a decent job. How are you me?"
"Believe me when I say this: I am you. I am the hardship, the abuse that you went through. I am you without that hideous mask you're wearing. I am angry at you."
"Angry... why? If we're the same, we should be happy, right?"
"You're not happy."
"But, I am..."
"You're not."

I staggered back a step.

"Tell me, why am I unhappy?" I asked. 
"Deep down in your mind, clouded by a thick wall of ignorance, you are truly unhappy. You have been unhappy for the majority of your life. You are not yourself. You have not been yourself. I am your repressed memories, the person you have lied to."

His words took me aback. I looked at him in shock and disbelief. A slight part of me knew that he was right. The memories started to creep up again to my mind once more. The addiction.

"I struck a dissonant chord, didn't I?" He asked. 
I paused.
"Maybe... you're right. I am dead after all. I think it's time to be honest with myself."

I sat across from myself. I looked at him in the eyes.

"I don't believe we've seen each other for a while. It's good to see you again." he said to me in a calm, warm voice. 
"It's... been a while, huh?"
"Haha, yes it has. I'm glad to have you back."
"I'm not sure I want to be back..."
"I know it's hard. But this is needed. You need to face yourself."
"But who am I?"

My mirror's voice turned stern.

"You are the very things you see in front of you; you are the addict, your own abuser, your loneliness. I am the very things you are."

He took a pause. 

"Our addiction runs deep. Our addiction to drugs and alcohol just to get through life. To keep us feelings repressed, that addiction to anything keep us from being ourselves. This is our abuse. Our abuse to ourselves. The self harm way back when, to keep other feelings at bay. This abuse has developed our isolation. Our disconnection with the world. The fake world that we built for ourselves, we smothered ourselves in."

"What do you want from me?"
"An apology."
"No, I did all those things for the good of my family. I am not apologizing."
"Please..."
"No, I... I can't forgive myself..."
"You must. It is time to breathe again. It is time to let go. You must let go of that anger."
I stood up, looking down on my reflection.
"God damn it! I am not going to apologize for something that I needed to do."
"You didn't have to do it! You chose to do it. You chose to be unhappy!"
"I chose!.. I chose... to do better for myself..."
"Do you call this 'better'? Am I really what you wanted? A deformed, mangled monster!?"
"You don't know me! If we were the same, you would agree with me!"
"I DO AGREE WITH YOU! I agree with you... but do you agree with the things you've done with yourself? The monster you've created? Can you accept me and say sorry for yourself?"

I crumbled to the ground, broken. 

"No... I can't... I really can't..."

Sobbing on the floor, my mirror faded into the white background. Soon later, the light started to fade. Then, there was blackness.
