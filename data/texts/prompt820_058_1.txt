For all of its Latin architecture, the interior of the building was oddly modern. 

Of course, Jon paid no mind to this, as he plummeted a few inches to the ground. It woke him with quite a start, and Jon recognized immediately that the hard marble was not even close to his bean bag chair. In fact, none of the room was as his room looked. Rather than his television on which Fallout was running, there was instead a gargantuan pillar reaching all the way to the top, an easy 5 stories high. On it was a rotating screen, with weapons of all sorts rotating around it, from Excalibur from England all the way to the Japanese Kusanagi. However, one caught his eye, mostly due to the gold border around it. It was a sort of spear, but with hundreds of small barbs in the tip. From a smaller screen on which it was more prominently featured, he selected it. The smaller screen read back it's name. It was the Gáe Bulga, an ancient Celtic weapon, wielded by Cú Chulainn, and a button next to it saying 'Summon'. Jon, of course, had never heard of it. He decided it best to press the button, and from the top of the cylinder dropped the spear. Soon after, a training dummy materialized on the other side of the room. Jon decided to launch the spear at the dummy, and when he did, it had no effect. Nothing happened, except for how the spear got slightly stuck in the dummy. After removing it, a slip of paper came down the cylinder, displaying how Jon had to use it. Per the paper, Jon was required to punt it, like an American football. After 3 times, he managed to do it, and hundreds and thousands of barbs shot all across the dummy's body, turning it into nothing more than a thorn bush with a bit of fabric. After that, Jon awoke in his bean bag, Gáe Bulga in hand.
