The first time Karren saw Death, she was Eight years old. It was a drug-addict, who had probably been unable to pay off a debt one too many times, so a broken crack pipe was shoved through his jugular.

Briefly, she thought **I should go get help.** But a morbid curiosity was quickly over taking her. She approached the body, thinking it was dead, when suddenly, it lurched. Upon seeing her, the man suddenly gasped and sputtered.

"He-He-Help," He gargles between wet coughs, blood spilling out of his mouth, "Help...me."

But Karren didn't move. She didn't know a lot about the human body, but she did know a person only had so much blood, and the crack pipe was only causing his to come out faster. So she crouched, just out of arms reach, and watched as the man went under the metamorphosis of going from a person, to a corpse. She found herself excited, thrilled at the changes that over came the man. She reveled in the slowing of his movements, how the light of consciousness slowly dimmed in his eyes, how the calls for help came slower, and quieter, but somehow, more fevered and desperate at the same time. And finally, the feeling she had when she heard the man's final death rattle, well, she didn't even know **what** to call that, but it was salacious.

Now, though, her fingers itched. She wanted to touch the body, explore it, find out how it worked, why it had stopped. And more importantly, she wanted to learn how she could feel these things again. She was just getting ready to touch the body, when a chill ran up her spine.

*Child,* A voice said, and that feeling shot through her body, like when the man took his last breath, *Move Aside.*

She shivered, the voice was like a continuous last breath, and it had the same effect on her. Slowly, she turned around, and when she did, she didn't gasp, she didn't scream. She smiled, "Are you Death?"
