     I found the prophecy! Not that any of that mattered now. In a matter of hours the ducks would have conquered the metropolitan area and begun to manifest their destiny westward.

     My grandmother died a year ago yesterday. After my pop pop died she couldn’t have lasted long. I was fortunate enough to spend their final days with them, an opportunity for which I am very grateful. My mother’s parents were very goofy, as is my mother and as was I before the ducks attacked.

      Because of their goofiness, I thought their coordinated final words were one last, posthumous joke- something my family could look back on and laugh. Now the foretold coming of the ducks is nothing to laugh about.

      As I read and re-read what can only be described as a forgotten transcript from the days of old, the script became alarmingly clear to me. The years of duck hunting had taken their toll and the ducks were fed up. Of course, no animal with any form of conscience can just genocide another creature, except for humans of course.

      But these ducks acted with tact. They warned the human race of their attack alright, but how could they warn them so that they wouldn’t fight back? What’s something no human would ever bring up in conversation? 

      When the ducks figured out how to hijack the cellular towers to instill images and phrases into the minds of those who suffered from dementia and Alzheimer’s, they knew their work was complete. Nobody would ever tell anyone else about the final words of their afflicted loved ones.

     As I flashed back to reality, I would have just as soon stayed in my reminiscence. I could hear the squabbles of the ducks, the cacophony muddled with screams of the innocent. There was nothing left to be done. There was nothing that could be done. Nothing.
