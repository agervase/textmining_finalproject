Tonight was very special. As I was scrolling through Reddit before going to bed, I died. No pain, no warning, no fruition, just a quick and easy death. There are many theories on what happens to you after you die, but I wasn't surprised when I found myself in a court room in front of Judge God. When he told me that I was exactly the 100 Billionth person to die which gave me the opportunity to undo a single decision in my life, I smiled from ear to ear. This was the easiest choice I could ever make and yes, of course it was about love.

My sophomore year of college started out with a bang as I met the woman of my dreams: Code Name. She was in my Creative Writing class and we immediately hit it off. Before you know it, I was over at her house reading her writing, making out on the couch, and listening to Rod Stewart. I had it all and I didn't realize it. Her smile was contagious and her eyes had a way of looking right through me. My heart melted just being with her. I was in love

I don't know what happened and I will always remember this me as the biggest douche to ever walk the planet, but the day after winter break ended I decided to just forget about her. I wouldn't look at her, I wouldn't talk to her, I moved and sat on the other side of the classroom. I don't know why. She was devastated and I didn't give a fuck. I acted like I was better, but realistically the idea of commitment shook me to the core. Looking back, I have never regretted anything more. Luckily, after a month or so she was able to move on too, even found another guy. And as any movie or proverb would have it, that is when it hit me. For the rest of the year I went into a depression. Beat myself up everyday about not only losing her, but being such a head ass in the process. I tried so many times to work up the courage to talk to her or try and get her back, I even wrote an immaculate letter confessing my love. But I was always too scared to even start a conversation with her. I felt like the evilist villain that was not wanted anymore, and it was deserved. I haven't seen her in six months because she has been studying abroad, but I will probably see her pretty soon. I don't know what I am going to do yet. I think I'm still in love, but honestly have no idea.

If I could undo one thing, I would stay with Code Name until the end of time, until I die. Which actually already happened.
