“Have you ever been lied to?” Marcy asked Holic, nose crinkled. They sat in their middle school’s main hallway, waiting to speak to the counselor. 

“Not that I know of,” Holic said.

Marcy eyed the banner across from them. “Every 15 minutes somebody is lied to, and they don’t know it. -The Informers.” Holic was sure that stat was baseless, made to scare the innocent youth of America. Each year their school was visited by the Informers, and some years a student or two “moved away” right after.

“You know why we’re really here?” Holic said, turning to face Marcy.

“Why?” 

“They’re searching for liars.” 

Marcy paled. “No! You’re lying!”

Holic shrugged. That was a heinous insult, but it was Marcy.

“Oh, I’m sorry, Holic,” Marcy stammered. “It’s just that you must not have thought it through. That’s what I meant.”
 
The counselor’s door burst open. A boy ran out, tears streaming. He was shaking his head back and forth. 
“Tommy!” Marcy yelled. She stood up and narrowed her eyes at Holic.

“What?” Holic said. 

“Did you tell Tommy the same thing?” 

Holic nodded. 

“You mis-informer,” Marcy seethed. 

The counselor, Mr. Banley, stepped out. He stood tall in his Informers uniform. A white suit with gleaming black buttons. “Holic, you are next.” He handed Marcy a backpack. “Take this to Tommy.” 

Holic followed the creature into his den.

“Tommy told me of your theory,” Mr. Banley growled. “That was…most unwise.” 

Holic gripped his armrests tightly. This was his chance to face down evil. He had Mr. Banley, that liar, dead to rights. It was last year that Holic had figured it out. He looked into Mr. Banley’s eyes, dark holes that would tear him apart if given a single chance. 

“Not speaking today. I hope you believe your words.” 

Holic sneered. “Of course I do. You don’t scare me.” 

Mr. Banley whispered. “That, my dear boy, is a lie.” He was looking at Holic’s white knuckles. 

Small steps outside. The sneeze of a padded chair being occupied. Marcy had returned. 

“You don’t scare me!” Holic said again, lying. What bothered Holic was that he had been called a liar twice in ten minutes. He had been so careful! He wanted to fight for good. To find liars and expose them. To use his powers for good. He wanted to be a hero. 

Mr. Banley opened up a drawer. He placed a small Informer’s pin on the table. It was a sword and pen crossed.  
“You will be taken away. Like the others." Mr. Banley leaned back in his chair. "Three in one day. What a catch.” 

Holic shook his head. He fought back the tears. Truth was on his side. “You are a liar. I have photos and video of what you did. I watched your every movement that day. This is the end. I’ve sent it all to the police.” 

Mr. Banley stood up, knocking over his chair. “You did what?”

The bell rang. Chatter, yells, and sneaker squeaks. The thin door barely kept the noise out. 

“You’re finished,” Holic said. A smile crept to his lips and he started to leave. 

Mr. Banley scrambled and grabbed Holic by the shoulder.

"Stop-" Holic had his breath knocked out. Mr. Banley had shoved him against the wall.

“I am a liar!" Mr. Banley said, mouth right next to Holic's ear. 

Holic helplessly battered at Mr. Banley. He opened his mouth to yell. Mr. Banley wrapped his hand around Holic’s throat, cutting off the scream. 

“I am a liar, and so are you.” Mr. Banley reached over and grabbed the pin. He pressed the pin straight into Holic, drawing a thin yelp from the boy. “And so are all Informers. We are your family now, your only hope of surviving this drab world, and you will fix what you have done. For there are few of us, and what you’ve done could really be the end.” Mr. Banley stepped away, winded, less tall than before.

Holic took out the pin. He felt a spot of blood ooze out with it. “Liars will say anything to get their way.” 

Mr. Banley returned to his seat. “What I did was not wrong. Nobody was hurt. Either way, it will be taken care of.” 

“I saw you practicing impressions,” Holic said with a shaky voice. “That’s intent to commit a crime.” 

Two Informers barreled into the room and grabbed Holic.

“If we can destroy the tapes and I'm not arrested, I’ll teach you how to do them,” Mr. Banley said gently.

The two informers hauled Holic out, his feet stumbling to keep pace.

Marcy glanced up at Holic, who had tears running down his face. She started to sob. 

“Don’t be scared, Marcy,” Holic said. “I’ll protect you when we get there.”
