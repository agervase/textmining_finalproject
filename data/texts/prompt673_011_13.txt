Death arrives in a clearing.  

Standing on dampened grass, a quick scan of his surrounding reveals that he is encircled by waist high wildflowers.  Although blue skies are just above the horizon, a glance up shows something more remarkable…the deep black of space, with the swirl of purple cosmos.

“Where am I?”, he says out loud.

“Life”, she says… “you are in the garden”.

He spins around to capture the voice.  

Before him, barefoot and clad in a white linen long dress, is Emily…or life itself…the last soul in the Universe to take.

She smiles at him, and says:  “You and I were once one you know…one soul that was separated into two.”

With this, Death takes in her beauty…her almost Nordic pure golden blonde hair, braided in an almost Valkyrie fashion.  “How did I get here?”, he replies.

“Moments ago, the Universe that the humans see, was all but gone.  All that remained was you, and the smallest portion of light.  And with that light, is life.   I am that light...I am life, and I am the garden.”

In this moment, Death has complete and total understanding.  He closes his eyes, and sees his own garden…deep inside.  It looks similar, but with trees where the wildflowers are.  “Yes”, she says.  “You see it.  Death, you have taken so much from this Universe, but within you…you still have Life.”

Death knew in this moment how to fulfill his destiny, and he takes a step towards life, and reaches out his hand.  Life mirrors his movements, and laces her fingers in his.  They both close their eyes, and pure golden energy powerfully flows through both of their vessels…like two pillars of flowing radiating light…stemming from the infinite space above…down to their feet.  These two pillars begin to swirl, and weave together, until a torrent of energy spirals…faster and faster.

The Universe, at this moment, both ends and begins…while two lovers lost…find each other, once again.
