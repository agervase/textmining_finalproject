I've posted some of my older Writing Prompts to it for those who are curious. It may help scratch the itch while I work on the next part. New parts to this story will be ~simultaneously posted here and there.

Hope you all enjoy the ride.

A tip about [reminders](/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5ptqyj/wp_you_live_in_a_world_where_everybody_is_blind/dcw0ra0/) that may help some of you.

**[The Story]**

It wasn't intentional.

Nothing lasts forever, right? We've all had a lens or two replaced at some point during our life. You go in, they put you under, you wake up with the new lens.

So when my lens started glitching, I knew what the problem was. Colours in my left eye started to look washed out, sometimes there would be a flicker. I knew I needed to go in and get my lens replaces.

But I just didn't have *time* ya know? Or I felt like I didn't. I was busy with work and life and Cathy. I kept going "Ok, today. Today I will book myself in.", then by the end of the day it turned into "tomorrow, tomorrow I will book myself in.".

It just kept going like that.

Then one morning I woke up and half my vision was blank. I panic, I thought I might of damaged the nerves or something. I ran to the bathroom and checked my eye in the mirror, which is actually really hard to do. The eye I wanted to look at couldn't see, and I couldn't get it close enough to the mirror and look at it with the other eye.

I ended up using a little hand mirror Cathy must have brought over some time.

I looked at my eye and it looked fine, except it was black where my iris was. It was stupid, really, what I did next... They always tell you that they're made from a special breathable membrane and not to remove them, you might damage the tissue underneath.

I'd always believed that, but in that moment I was scared and I thought the lens might of burnt out my eye or something. So I poked at the lens, found that while it was kind stuck on, if I was gentle I could peel it off. So I did, just to take a look, right?

But when I peeled it off, suddenly I could see again out of that eye. Everything was really blurry and stuff. I thought it must have been some kind of miracle, like maybe they'd secretly upgraded the lens to fix everyone's eyes but were waiting to tell us all or something.

I collapsed on my bed in relief and just lay there for a bit, carefully squinting and blinking my left eye. As I did, it slowly got less blurry, until I could see fine. I was relieved and confused. 

Maybe the lenses had already fixed my eyes? Maybe they were waiting for everyone to be fixed or didn't know how well they worked?

I went back to the bathroom to grab my phone so I could call up and let them know it worked.

That's when I saw it.

I caught it out the corner of my left eye when I was picking up my phone, some kind of blemish on my forehead. But when I turned to look at it in the mirror, it was gone. Or nearly gone. There was like a faint smudge on the left hand side of my forehead.

I closed my left eye and it was gone entirely. Fuck, I thought, this must be why they haven't announced anything. My eye was still damaged.

I sighed and switched eyes, closing my right and opening my left. I nearly fell on my ass in shock.

I could see it again, and it wasn't some smudge. There was a pattern on my forehead. You know QR codes? Those weird squiggly square things tech geeks keep thinking will take off?

It was like one of those, but bigger and all... connected. Like a maze with just the occasional dot.

I slowly switched eyes again and it went blurry, then vanished. My right eye, the lens eye, couldn't see it... And when I looked at it with both eyes, my brain apparently got confused between the inputs and just kind of... Smudged it out to rectify the difference.

That was really, really weird.

I grabbed my keys and my phone and went outside, to go see my neighbour and that's when I saw it. The sky. I figured out later it's why colours looked wrong as my lens started to fail.

The sky wasn't some big beautiful blue thing with a big yellow sun and white clouds. It was grey with smudges of brown. The sun looked dim and red through it, making everything seem dim.

But if I looked with my right eyes, it was all bright and colourful and happy. If I looked with my left, it was dim and grey and washed out.

I headed over to my neighbours house, and stopped to look at their flower bed before I knocked on their door. All the flowers... All of them, had little weird QR codes on them.

Left eye, they still looked like flowers, but washed out and covered in tiny squiggles. 

Right eye, normal bright, happy colours and no squiggles.

I didn't know what was happening, but it was obviously something massive and messed up.

I knocked on my neighbours door and asked if he'd noticed anything weird. He said he hasn't, but asked if I was ok because I was acting a bit shaken. And probably because I kept squinting at him with just one eye.

Bob was a pretty good neighbour and he looked pretty much how I remembered, except he was paler. He looked a little unhealthy and had a great big symbol on his forehead like mine. I apologised and said I was fine and left.

I went to the library, next, and that's where I found it. The whole way there, there was all these odd things. More of those patterns scrawled on all sorts of things, even worked into the fur of a dog I saw as I drove past. 

I had to drive really carefully too, because while the shapes were the same, none of the signs had actual text, just those big patterns on them. I kept having to double check them with my right eye to see what they actually said.

I'd gone to the library because my internet was out and I thought maybe I could get answers there. Maybe they'd have information on.. Single eye hallucinogenic breaks?

But when I went to use the computers... If I looked at them with my left eye, they just had those patterns. They shifted and undulated as I used the keyboard and mouse... Look at them with the right eye and they had the internet explorer and the Juggle home page.

I decided to check some books instead, because that was just a bit too weird. But when I opened up the books? Same thing. Left eye, no text on the pages, just different squiggles and lines. Even the blank pages had this simple little squiggle on them.

I tried a book on psychology, a book on optometry. All the same stuff, and if I used my right eye to read them they didn't seem to have anything useful. So I thought I'd try a book on the lenses and their history.

That's when I found it.

I read the whole book with my right eye, checking the pages with my left. Information on how they were supposed to work, on how they were first discovered and made after pollutants in the air started to blind people and cause neo-natal blindness. Squiggles squiggles squiggles.

I finished the book, using mostly my right eye. The lenses were just supposed to bypass the damaged cone and beam the signals to the nerves. They were supposed to show you what was already there, and according to the book, they'd done lots of trials with the last few people who could see and the lenses worked great.

Then there was that blank page that books have, ya know, just before the back cover? I was tired and confused and stressed and my right eye was feeling sore from doing all the work. So just as I was about to shut the book, I sighed and blinked my eye open.

That's when I found the note.

It was on that last page, written beneath one of the blank page squiggles, in pen.

"If you're reading this, then you are the one eyed man in the world of the blind. Open your eye and see. We will do our best to find you, but for now you are alone.

Do not wake the sleepers. Do not stare into the abyss, for the abyss stares back."
