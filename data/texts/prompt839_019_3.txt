The sound of checkmate echoed around the room. I had done it. I had beaten death. I smurked as I picked up his king and handed it to him. Half expecting him to lunge at me, I flinched as he reached out and took the chess piece. The chess board slowly melted into darkness and there was only me and him, locked in a dark, inescapable room. Death reached out his hand and uttered in a cold and soft thank you. He started trembling and shaking. His cloak slowly became shorter  as he melted with the room until there was only a bundle of cloth on the floor. I picked it up and did not know what to do. Seeing there was no way out, I put on the cloak. It shrouded around me and a sythe materialised in my hand. Then came the pain. Every inch of my body burned as my flesh evaporated. A table with chess pieces formed before me while I was locked in the position by the cloak. The pain was unbearable as I tried to move. Suddenly, a bright door appeared and a slim figure entered. She walks up to the table and looked questionably at me, unable to bear the pain any longer, I made my move. Two moves later, I had won her. Screams were heard as the floor opened up and hands dragged her down. The victory seemed to bring some comfort. A bright light flashed as another door appeared and shadows engulfed the chess board to reset it. The comfort from winning slowly became addicting, but every victory seemed to bring less comfort. I was unable to control my hands, A mysterious dark force seems to be controlling my every move. I wanted to lose. I did not want to win anymore. A bright flash appeared again as doors opened for another eternity
