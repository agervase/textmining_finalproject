I hear it in my mind first. *Beep* This faint rythmical beeping. *Beep* It is just in my head... *Beep* But more and more I realize it was coming from my right. *Beep* I slowly try to open my eyes. *Beep* White light from the lamps above entering my eyes. *Beep* All was calm when suddenly I felt like... *Beep* I'm drowning! I grasp for air, reach out trying to find a hold in this hell, BREATHE! *BEEP* I feel my hand touching an stone-cold object, with a round surface. *BEEP* Suddenly the object was gone. Something shatters. *BEEP* A door opens to my left, voices. They're arguing! *BEEP* No, discussing, or ordering. They come closer. *BEEP* Suddenly a voice goes to my right, while I still grasp for something. *BEEP* I feel a person, his voice is the loudest. *BEEP* Is he talking to me? I reach for his hand, find it and squeeze it. *BEEP* He says something to me, I can't understand it. *BEEP* His voice is soothing though. *Beep* I crush his hand with pressure, the touch felt like the greatest thing ever. *Beep* I can breathe again. But no, I was breathing the whole time. *Beep* Why did it feel like I was drowning? The voices get clearer. *Beep* Someone is telling me everything is alright. *Beep* A wave of tiredness overcomes me. The person to my right releases his hand from mine. *Beep* I'm so tired...

I awake again. The white light still above me, a heat is on my entire right side. The beeping is gone, too. I look to my right. Sunlight enters my eyes, quickly I close them. The sunlight feels great. I look around. This is a hospital room, no doubt. I'm on one of those beds that you can roll around with little effort, a handle is dangling above me, attached to the bed via a contraption that goes above and behind my head. I grasp it, trying to pull myself up. Surprisingly it kinda works too. Though I feel scratchy and stingy in many areas of my body. I try to get a better look at my room. The right wall is completely windowed, a small desk stands at this side of the bed. It has a device with many buttons on it. Ahead of me is a small table with a vase on it. The vase looks new, the flowers in it however look like they've seen better days.  To my left are two doors. One with a bathroom symbol on it and another presumably leading out to the hallway. I look at my self... *What the fuck?* I had several tubes coming out of me. One at my neck, one in my right arm and I presume the stingy and *extremely* uncomfortable feeling in my private area and inside is another. The thought of that is disgusting. The tubes connected to bags with liquids respectively. Both had clear liquid in them. If there was a thire for my other area then I didn't see it. Gladly. I check the device on my right. There was a button with a nurse on it. Being smart and all I know what it means and immediately press it. Now I just have to wait.
