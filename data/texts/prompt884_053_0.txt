I wake up, bound to an office chair by leather restraints.

&#x200B;

3*/4 on the comfortably scale,* I think to myself. 

&#x200B;

Groggy I look around the room--- barren, no furniture except the walls and floor being covered in saran-wrap, as I sit below a red heat lamp. 

&#x200B;

*OooOooOoooo, heat lamp nice touch, 4/7. I get to work out my tan.*

&#x200B;

From the corner of the room I hear a burp with a weird intro I don't believe I was suppose to hear, "Ooh crap-- messed up my entrance. Just compose yourself, wait a few minutes to stress him out--- you got this!"

&#x200B;

*Was that a woman mumbling to herself? Surely must be a prank, or something really kinky going on here.* 

&#x200B;

Bound and knowingly being observed, I realize it was no time to try to break free of my restraints. In the few minutes it takes for the woman to build up her confidence, I close my eyes leaning back like a dead possum in the chair. Turning my face side to across the neck-rest to get an even tan. 

As the minutes tick by through the night I notice a small rectangular screen flickering from the same origin I heard the woman's voice. 

&#x200B;

*Huh?* I think to myself.

&#x200B;

Some time later, the sabbath of the corner approaches with the screen in hand. A woman partially covered in blood--- in entirely black clothing.  Her face pale, her hair covered by a skullcap.  She stands at the edge of the light from the heat lamp. A death glare written across her face, soulless behind colorful eyes. She holds a phone--- my phone--- sticking up to show a screen of my tinder.

&#x200B;

I gaze upon the screen to see how good my signal is, looking back to her noticing the splatter of blood. I ask, "Are you on your period or just happy to see me?"

&#x200B;

She calmly lowers the phone down to her side, holding the same face as before. "You're tied to a chair and under a hot-lamp, being grilled, and your opener is 'Are you on your period or just happy to see me?'" 

&#x200B;

I give the widest shrug I can, "Listen lady, my bio said bring the condoms, and I'll bring the heat. Unfortunately got no condom on--- " 

&#x200B;

She slowly brandishes a knife from the sheathe I failed to notice.

&#x200B;

I look her square in the eyes and say, "I'm guessing that's not a rubber."

&#x200B;

Her eyes widen with hate, walking past the edge she stood on into the light, putting the knife agaisnt my throat.

&#x200B;

I cough, "Yep, not a rubber knife."

&#x200B;

Her face narrows in confusion. 

&#x200B;

"Yeah, I didn't mean rubber condom."

&#x200B;

She dies of laughter. The end.

&#x200B;
