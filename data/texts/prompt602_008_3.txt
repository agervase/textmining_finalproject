The one called Reverie hovered in place, transfixed by the vibrations it felt from the communications deck of the interstellar vehicle it was in. Its kind was a nitrogen based species. They referred to themselves as the Elevated. The name made sense for several reasons, the first being their very method of locomotion. They floated using the careful calibration of gases that their spherical bodies performed, and they moved, and controlled using their electro-magnetism inducing organs that allowed them to traverse terrains rich in metal. The second reason for their name was their beliefs about themselves and the universe; that they were pristine creatures designated to survey and maintain the vast cosmos under the authority of their spiritual head and de-facto monarch, the Elevator.  


The Elevated communicated primarily using vibrations and electromagnetic signals that their bodies were so adept at creating. So in effect, Reverie was listening as its vehicle informed it about the blue planet that it had stumbled onto by happenstance. There were structures and movement on the surface that could be explained only by intelligent life, it was informed. And this intelligent life survived on an unregulated, inhospitable, wreck of a world!

Reverie was quicker than most of its kind in accepting these new facts about what it had encountered. The Elevated  were taught from birth that life could only survive under the strictest control. That the beloved Elevator and its ancestors had made possible the Grand Genesis; The original world where the elevated were born and thrived. Reverie was always a skeptic of the blind devotion of its progenitor and siblings. But it had accepted that while the original atmosphere that allowed its species to exist might have been an accident, any intelligent life would require careful control to evolve.

And now, Reverie was beginning to realize how its very foundations of knowledge might have been propagandized into believing the logic of the Grand Genesis creation myth. *Why would all life need to resemble the Elevated and their need for a carefully maintained atmosphere?* it thought. *Why would all life require an optimal gas and metal concentration constantly in the vicinity?*

Reverie rotated in joy at its discovery. The feelings of doubt, and living a half-truth it had felt all its life dissolved into its celebration. But then it stopped. It realized why this part of the galaxy was marked as a hazard zone for over-zealous surveyors like it, why entire planetary systems were deemed non-pristine and forbidden. *It's not always inhospitable planets and impure regions of the universe that cause surveyor deaths and disappearances. Sometimes, The Elevator does not allow those who discover the truth to return. How many of my brethren have died thus? How much intelligent life different from ours has been obliterated because it was a threat to our draconian dominion?* Reverie recoiled at the thought that its discovery might lead to the extinction of all the creatures that it beheld on this crazy, wonderful, danger-ridden, circus of a world.

After a moment's hesitation, Reverie instructed its vehicle's systems to start documenting its findings. It had made up its mind. *My kind has to be liberated. Even if it requires help from the life on this blue planet.*
