As I stood there wondering what the hell, a voice scream "get down". I quickly dropped just as the meat clever wizzes past my left ear and sticks into the wall behind me.

My heart racing, trying to understand what is happening, I feel a warm trickle of fluid run down my neck. The clever sliced the edge of my ear off.

Before I had time to react, a body was next to me. He was talking but my mind want understanding the words. He shook me, I snapped attention as he said "You OK? Thank god you're here now we have a chance of getting that thing. Grab the clever and follow me" I asked "Who are you man?"

"player 1 was the reply"

What thing? Who is this? Do I stay or follow? It was then I heard the gurgling noise and the smell of rancid flesh. Whatever the 'thing's was, it wasn't human and wanted us dead.

I grabbed the clever and took off. We set up in an ambush position near the stairs so either of us could attack as it came past. I'd never killed anything before, what would it be like? As we crouched quietly my mind again wandered off. What is going on?

I couldn't answer as I didn't know but the smell got worse so the creature was close. Player 1 launch out at the creature, stabbing wildly with his knife piercing the flesh of the thing with howls of pain. I jumped up to help but something held me back. I tried swinging my arm holding the clever but it couldn't move. Was I just scared senseless? Was I caught on something?

The answer came quickly, as I turned to see the razor sharp claws swing towards my throat. As my life slowed and my blood pulsed down my body to the floor, I realised....fuck, there were two of them.
