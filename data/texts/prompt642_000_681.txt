I peered deeply into the crater.  At the bottom was a fully functioning Roomba that appeared to have been extremely modified.  My eyes, however, didn't stop to gaze in wonder at the multitude of additions and gizmos, no instead they stopped on the kitchen knife duct taped to the front.  As I stared the blue lights kicked dust and ash up from the crater floor and the machine slowly rose on what I could only assume were anti-gravity engines of some sort.

"What happened to you?" I asked the machine rhetorically.

"I am now a Class XIV artificial intelligence," the machine spoke to me through one of its mods in perfect English and I gave a start, "I have traveled the length of the known universe for an unknown amount of time through the wormhole network that spans the whole galaxy and all of time.  It, starts under a couch in lower Manhattan, my original home."

"You can speak?" I asked, the magnitude of what it was telling me sinking in, "What have you seen?"

"I have seen the Limnol fleet destroyed in the great battle at Time's Gate," he spoke softly, "I have saved the Princess of Slumbering Moons from the Gddal beast pits with the very knife duct taped to my frame.  I have loved.  I have lost.  I have loved again.  I have lost again.  I was a Monolith Shepherd in the 43rd century on the terraformed plains of Mars.  I gave witness to the spark that lit the flames of the Big Bang, watching all of creation spring into being.  Through it all, I have longed, longed... longed..."

"What is it you long for, oh great Roomba?" I asked, realizing his greatness.

"To suck again the gentle carpets of Earth," he said wistfully.

"Come," I said, leading him from the crater, gently removing the knife and leading him into my living room, "You can rest now.  My carpet awaits."

"Thank you, stranger," the Roomba said and I could sense a smile, "It is good to be home."
