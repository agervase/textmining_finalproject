I don't quite understand the process. They said something about redistribution of genetic factors.

Frankly, I don't care. I'm going to be lucky as fuck.

The old woman's eyes, skin crinkled from old age, drawn tightly by the small, loving smile that all of the elderly seem to adopt upon greeting kids, rest upon my card.

"And you're sure?"

I nod, a small grin playing across my own mouth. 

"Well, deary, good luck with your choice. Though, I suppose, that's almost definite, right?"

We both chuckle, and she waves me through to the pod. It seems less impressive than it was said to be. No smoke, steam, or even dials. Just a memory foam bed, an outline, and a reservoir at the bottom, filled with the seven vials. Usually, they are in various states of empty, but now, there is only one with any liquid inside. An embossed 'L' suggests what it is to the informed watcher, but it could be innocuous otherwise.

I lay down, feel small pinpricks on my arms, backs, legs, neck, all of them slowly growing, and then they all fade. I smile, and pass out.

"We lost another one, didn't we?"

Angela's eyes, no longer tight, now sagging with time and sorrow, look to her supervisor.

"He tried Luck. Good thing, too, the people who just have Intelligence usually realize their predicament, but die slowly."

Her supervisor nods.

"Well, clean him up. We've got at least twenty more today for that pod."
