(My grammar is atrocious and I apologize in advance)

Stage 4 they said, there is no stage 5. Looks like this is. I've been moved to hospice, it's spreading. 

My nurse here is pretty but new. kinda slow. She said her name is Rebecca, seems off. 

Each day Becca walks through the door she seems even more "off". I finally figured out what's happening,  death got in her. I start noticing things she does different.  She'll offer baked goods to us,  says she wants to spend time with us even though she obviously doesn't enjoy it. Then why?

 She wants to end our so called suffering, fucking bleeding hearts. I won't stand for it. 
I start hiding bits of the poison she trys to make me swallow in those shit cups. Grind em up and put an in a little bag under my pillow.

Every day she walks in thinking something's gonna happen but just looks at my chart and a heartbreak frown shows then a fake smile as she says it'll all be fine soon she "feels" it. Fuck you becca.

One day she walks in with a shit eating grin and a pan of brownies, says she wants me to eat one. I tell her it would be rude to eat alone so she has one with me but I dropped mine, tell her my hands got weak. She picks it up and we toast to health and beyond then she walks away. 2 hours later people running all over like the damn place is on fire. Beccas convulsing, I knew that shit was poison, she should've watched her shit more if she was gonna try to get rid of me. 

Next day find out she couldn't take the stress of the job and od'd on the shit she was slinging. Being told this by a scab nurse that walked through my door, but I can already tell, death got in her.
