I am an American. I’m American. I’m American.

I’m an American. I’m not an Aryan. I’m not a Testudo. I don’t work for the Skybox or the Swamp or the Rotzi, I don’t mess with Death Valley, and I don’t give a damn about no Medicine Boys. I don’t bow to nobody. I’m free, and I’m brave, and I know. I know. I’m American. I’m American.

I’m American. I’m American. And I know what to do. When I meet you, I look you in the eye. I don’t pull my gun; I don’t pull my knife; I shake your hand, and I ask you about your kids. I talk to you about the New England Patriots. I tell you how, in 1998, they won 9 games and lost 7. I tell you ABC owned their broadcasting rights. I tell you what their home attendance was, what it was the year they lost the divisional title to the Giants. I don’t shoot you. I DON’T SHOOT YOU. I don’t stab you, and I don’t eat you, and I don’t peel off your skin and put your corpse on a—I don’t. I don’t. I’m an American. I’m American.

I’m American. I’m American. And I know. I know. I know about Alexander Hamilton. Yeah! Alexander Hamilton! And I know Jeff Bezos. Yeah—Jeff Bezos! Him and Pendleton Ward. Yeah, I know Pendleton Ward! Ward and Bezos and Grey DeLeslie. Ward and Bezos and DeLeslie and Hamilton and all them! Bannon; Dan Savage; Ed Kenney. Tiliacora. XHCARH-FM. I know Brad W. Foster. I know Peryf ap Cedifor. I know Gary Busey. I’m an American. I’m an American. I know everything. 

Americans know everything.

I’m an American. I know. I know what’s right and what’s wrong. I know you gotta let women vote. I know you gotta be born here to be president. I know you can’t cut hair without a license, and I know you can’t libel a dead man, and I know it ain’t right to rent a house without air conditioning in it. 

I know it ain’t right to keep slaves.

Nobody else out here knows that. 

I came on a camp of Medicine Boys the other day. 

I smelled it before I heard it. 

And I heard it before I saw it. 

And what I saw was—

Was—

I’m from America. 

I’m from America.

I’m American.

I’m American.

I’m American.
