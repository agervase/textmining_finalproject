Dear Council of Bobs, 

Well since we all know what this weekly newsletter is about let me just cut straight to the point. Bob, who shall remain surnameless since we all unfortunately know who you are, for the love of god please change your internet viewing habits. We all know you know what you're doing and we all know that we are not going to stop with this newsletter until you stop. We all know this week was brutal on all of us and we all know who was responsible for the disturbing, disturbing knowledge gained from your browsing activities. We all know you know the toll your habits are having on us. Bob, we are the Doctors of this fine nation and we all know we have the stomach to do our profession proud but we also all know we can not keep on this way. Every night,Bob? Every night! We all know we have to sleep, Bob! We all know people are DYING, BOB! We all know this isn't a joke.
Look, we all know what you've been through. We all know the mistake your parents made naming you so young and we all know this burden was not meant for a child but something has to give! We all know the audio-visual assault you are laying on us nightly is working. We all know the increase in medical disasters our nation is facing. We all know the government is in talks with India to bring in as many Patels as they can spare. Bob, we all know it doesn't have to be this way but we also all know the ball is in your court. So, Bob, we as we have daily for the last six months, entreat you to cease your assault. You know with what sincerity and desperation we ask this. We all know you have a heart, Bob. Please.

Council of Bob, M.D.
