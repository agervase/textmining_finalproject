"Well she did nearly decapitate him!" Frigg said, squinting at me.

"Well, it wasn't really intentional, was it?" Odin went on, picking at his tooth with a spear. "Does it--DO YOU SPEAK ASGARDLISH?"

"I can hear you," I said.

He shruged. "Nope, didn't understand a word."

"Alfather," Baldr said, examining the object in question. "It occurs to me that one side of this has been sharpened."

"Fair point!" he replied. "But for what purpose? My ravens inform me that this thing is for slicing... piece-a? Piece of what? I don't understand their handwriting, it's jibberish."

"Could it be, say, classified as a short-nosed axe?" Heimdall asked.

"Well, no," Thor interrupted. "The purpose of an axe is to channel a large amount of force through a small, sharpened point. And besides, the stainless steel is completely unsuitable for warfare."

"I see," Heimdall replied.

"I don't see the half of it," Odin continued. "We still haven't figured out if this is a weapon or not, and I'm getting very thirsty."

"Should it not come down to intent?" Zeus asked.

"Now, Zeus, you have an advisory role on this council! Just because half your people went and started following that weirdo on the cross doesn't mean you have to spout Paulian garbage at me. He didn't even get any wiser!"

"We've been here for two hours!" Tyr complained. "I'd give my right arm for some supper!"

"Alright, alright!" Odin replied. "Can we just agree that this is a weapon and be done with it? It'll mean lunch, and we'd only have to backdate approval to... how many souls?"

"Nine hundred thousand, four hundred and sixty two," Heimdall answered.

"Good gods, these things are more dangerous than I thought," he went on, staring at the steel object like it might jump off the table. "Right, it's a no from me. Valhalla is plenty crowded enough as it is. All in favour?"

"AYE!"

"W-wait!" I yelled.

"Sorry, can't hear you!" he said lifting his mallet. "Take it up with a norn!"
