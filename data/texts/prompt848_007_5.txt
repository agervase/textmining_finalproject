Being from Ohio, I always ended up hating just about anywhere else. Why should I go somewhere where either the wildlife, the people or the god damn land itself wants to kill me? Ohio is safe and I love it.  That's why I didn't want to go on a business trip to California. And leave it to the San Andreas to decide it was going to throw an apocalyptic tantrum the week I was set our west coast headquarters in Santa Barbara straight about federal accounting reports. That's how I got trapped under 5 stories of concrete with people I had only met once and their kids that until three days ago were waiting like any other day in the corporate day care center for their parents to finish working. Jesus, there really isn't any warning before these things happen is there. What happened to all those stories you hear about birds disappearing or cats acting even weirder days before a natural disaster. It was just Tuesday another day telling accountants how to avoid multi million dollar fines and the next second you're being shaken like an unwanted baby. Then bam! darkness trapped in a concrete and re bar prison because corporate decided to occupy the oldest cheapest office space it could find. What do they even spend those tax breaks they get for hiring us veterans on? So hear I am the violent orange red glow from my fist the only thing lighting up the darkness. I've been charging this punch for three days. I know I can't survive the force I'm going to unleash. Hell charging a hit for 30 seconds with out special bracers and gloves could shatter your knuckles and break your wrist. But there's toddlers trapped down here and there time is worth more then the 50 years I might have left. I just wish I could see my wife one last time before I throw this unbelievable hay maker at 30 some feet concrete steel and glass.
