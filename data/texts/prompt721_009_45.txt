There was a low rumble coming from under the sink, it was barely loud enough for her to hear it from the other side of the room. A small sigh escaped her as she cursed under her breath. She tenderly placed the plant in her hand onto it's proper pot, the corner of her lips tugged up as the leaves reacted to her tending.

As she opened the cabinet doors the rumble turned louder. The pipes were shaking, about to burst too, and by the way the mended cracks were starting to break it wouldn't be after too long.

She cursed again, louder this time, and as she was about to go get her tool box a small chill ran from her neck all the way down to her wrists.

***Please.***

She gasped, hitting her head against the bottom of the sink at the sudden plea on her mind. The pain striked harder than she anticipated and she found herself falling against the opposite wall. There was a faint ringing in her ears.

***If you are out there.***

The ringing got to the tipping point of unbearable. Her nails clawing to her palms in a desperate attempt to stay focused on that voice.

The rumble of the pipes got franatic.

***Please.***

One of her hands went to brace to the wall.

***I need you.***

There was a crack, she wasn't sure were it came from.

***Zeme.***

It felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her lungs. The ringing in her ears subdued and she clutched her chest as she heaved, trying to get a hold of herself. 

No one had prayed to her name in centuries. 

As she calmed down, she took back her hand off of the wall, only to find it crumbling to her side and onto her hand. The damage wasn't as bad as she expected, but she dwelled on the patching she had to do later.

She turned to the sink and found the pipes had cracked open, *again*. She groaned at the mess around the kitchen and then realized there were tears streaming down her cheeks.

She chuckled as more spilled from her eyes and onto her dirty hands.

"Don't worry." She whispered. "I'll find you."

It was dawn when she heard the voice again. She had been walking about the woods behind the house, looking for new growths or animals passing by. The sky was a cold purple and one of her dogs, Nico, was chasing a scent deep into the woods, a fox probably, most likely a coyote.

This time she felt the earth beneath her move. She managed to calm the dog down before the first word came in.

She keened over.

***Please.***

It started like the first one.

***I just-***

Nico started whining when she didn't let it get any closer.

***I need to save it-***

She felt herself getting dizzy. The damn dog wouldn't stop crying.

***The farm- It's all I have left.***

The ground stopped trembeling and she catched herself before she fell over. Nico came over to her, it nuzzled at her side, concern seeping through it.

Her breathing went back to normal after a minute and she sat down on the ground, feeling the dirt beneath her prints. Nico settled it's head on her thigh, a reminder, an anchor.

The sky turned from purple to pink, and as it was turning light blue she stood up and walked calmly back to the house.

She needed to do some research

It was a coyote. Fell down a small ledge but managed to hit some rocks on the way down. It had broken it's spine and was wimpering in pain.

She cradled and soothed it through the process, making the pain more bereable to the poor animal. Her hands combing though it's fur made it fall asleep. 

It died and the colors of its life drained through its mouth. 

The mud beneath it recieving it as it should.
