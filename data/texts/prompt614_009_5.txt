So, I’ve been around a few times. I’ve learned a few lessons. I know some things. One of these things I know is what the people love in a leader. They’re not the qualities I love in a person, so I’ve never been a public leader. 

However, this go round, I’m born squalling and shitting myself with the knowledge of 1,000 years and I’ve had enough. I’m not drinking the breast-milk kool-aid. When the doctor smacks my tiny ass, I’m dreaming of his death.

By 8th grade I was class president, captain of the football team, making straight As, and pretending I gave a damn about EVERYONE.

Senior year in high school I was voted “Most Likely to Succeed” while maintaining class Presidency and a 4.0 Grade-Point Average.

I attended Harvard Law, graduated Magna Cum Laude, Class President, 4.0. I interned in Washington, D.C. for Congressmen and Cabinet Members. A few short years later I had the presidency.

I had a wife, a home, countless acquaintances, and one of the most powerful positions in the world. And I could finally fucking end it.

I went on live TV one day, like this:

“My fellow Americans, and any other citizens of the globe who happen to be watching. I’d like to say thank you for providing this opportunity to me. It has been a wonderful journey, and I am glad it has come to its conclusion. What I propose is a solution to all of our problems; quite literally an end to all suffering. I’ve lived in countless bodies, journeyed countless paths, and if humanity as a whole compares to the journey of repetition of life, which I assure you it does, then the conclusion I’ve drawn is this: it’s time to cash in the chips. Throw in the towel. Have you ever come home from a long day’s work and loved your bed more than anything? It’s time to go to sleep. Rest well, everyone.”

And with that, I detonated nuclear warheads around the world, smiling.
