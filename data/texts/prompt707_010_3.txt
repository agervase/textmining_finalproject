*I'm sorry, what?*

The device rested at my peripherals, as though my retina dare not look at it.

*"Math. I got math. Wanna try it?"* whispered Leo.

*"No."*

*"Dude don't be a sissy. It's awesome."*

*"Hey can we-"*

*"Come on, man, Bellarmine, you gotta live the life."*

*"Can we just talk about this after class?"*

He leaned back, clearly disappointed in my response.

*"Fine."*

No words were exchanged for the rest of the class. But I knew what was going on in his mind. Mine, on the other hand, was reeling.

*Leo's a mathematician? When? How? And does that mean he's a usurper of society? A... heretic?*

The word stung without being spoken - the sheer thought of it was corrosive.

But if he is... may Ford have mercy on his soul.

I avoided him for the rest of the day. And the next. And the next. The longer I avoided this conversation, the worse it would get. But on the other hand... it was already bad enough.

A week flew by before our eyes met. For the sake of our Ford, I might add, not by my intention. He saw me and hailed me down.

Leo started, "Look, I'm sorry about last week. I just really got into this whole math thing and I wanted to show you what math could do. But if you don't want to try it out, I understand."

"No, it's not that, it's..." I searched my mind for the right word - for even just a concept that would accurately describe how I feel about this. And finding none, I let myself trail. A mathematician was, quite simply, unprecedented.

"Like I said, I don't mind if you don't try it out. But math, man. Math can let you do so many things. You could describe how things move! And find out what you owe, and more!"

*Heretic. These were words of a heretic.*

"Look just try it out once, okay?"

*Heretic.*

"Nah, I'm really not into that stuff."

"Alright, I can respect that."

We walked away like we did any other day - as though we expected to see each other the next day. But I knew that our friendship was irreparably damaged. There was simply no way to reconcile this knowledge.

I won't call the Inquisition to report a heresy - no, I'm not that kind of a person. But there was simply nothing to be done about him. And when I saw the news a month later about the arrest of Galileo, well, the only thing there was to say was that he should have seen it coming.
