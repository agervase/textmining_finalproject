There was a strange epidemic going on. All the horses were going crazy; becoming carnivorous and eating all flesh in sight. Almost reminded me of the Walking Dead show, except for one difference: the disease was transmitted sexually.
So it wasn't the hardest thing, managing the horses. I just had to keep the sick ones from fuckin' the healthy ones. Overtime we farmers learned to deal with the sickness and my wife and I were able to manage our stables. Until that one day where I lost it all.
Wind was my favourite steed. Young, strong and magnificent. He was my breeding buck, so I did everything I could to prevent him getting sick. I even kept him in a separate stable from all the other horses.
One day, I was returning from the market to ce home to a shock! When I checked in on my horses, one of the mares had chomped down and ripped out the neck of her sister and was feasting on the carcass. Of course I had to put her out. You know the horses are infectious when their eyes begin to go yellow from jaundice.
While cleaning out the stable, I came to a heart stopping realization. Wind was the only horse to mate with that female in weeks. If she was sick, she must have gotten it from him!
Sadly, I walked up to his stable, preparing myself for the task at hand. I only had my double-barrel with a single shell left in it after putting down the first mare. As I walk up to the stable doors, I hear Wind neighing wildly inside. I kick open the door only to be shocked even more.
Kneeled under the belly of Wind is my wife: one hand between her legs, the other one holding Wind's whistle while she blew it. I was feeling a rush of emotions and couldn't think straight, my mind was racing. How long has this been going on? What if the sickness transmits to humans? Why the fuck is a horse's dick in my wife's mouth? I didn't know what to say or how to react, I just knew I had to end this, in one bullet. And that's when I remembered a dream I had: "always aim for the head."
