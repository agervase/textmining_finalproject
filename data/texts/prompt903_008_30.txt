There are bad years and then there are the years where a hive mind walks into your bar - well, walking is putting it lightly. Think more of a swollen stormwater pipe during heavy rain. Hopefully that will give you an image of what the doorway looked like for a good six months.

&nbsp;

 
I waited, at least three aeons passing in that time, until the last of the hive mind-controlled beings walked in, then I said in greeting, “Hello.” I kept it simple, lest I assume its identity and use the wrong cosmic-specific word. 

&nbsp;


“Good tidings, manling,” came the response, all beings talking simultaneously. I felt a shiver ripple up my spine.

&nbsp;


*I’ll never get used to this.*

&nbsp;


“What can I get for you? How about a few million glasses of our best ale, the Brown Dwarf? Or better yet, a Supernova on the rocks?”

&nbsp;

 
“A round of Carbon will do. Uncompounded, if you will,” the hive mind rumbled.

&nbsp;


“Exquisite choice,” I bowed and set to the task. 

&nbsp;


Owning a bar on the fringes of reality sure had its perks. I’d seen some incredible things. A thousand metre tall daemons whose eyes burned with hellfire, dreaded stellar worms that feed off psychic energy, and let’s not forget the singularity entities who drink my stock dry each millenium they pop in. These are the times why I chose this line of work. But when a hive mind comes along, it sure does make me question why I’m doing this job. 

&nbsp;


Getting the drinks together forced me to use three time-dilating parasites. What seemed like a minute for those in the room was three god-damned lifetimes I spent pouring drinks. The mental stress of those collective years can bare down on you after a while. Use the parasites enough times and you’ll eventually lose your mind. 

&nbsp;


I used one more in order to hand all the drinks around.

&nbsp;


“There you go,” I said with finality. 

&nbsp;


The lot of them drowned themselves in their drinks, a cacophony of splashes and gurgling. Before long, the round was finished. 

&nbsp;


The heads of all the beings turned in unison and said, to my dismay, “Another, please.”
