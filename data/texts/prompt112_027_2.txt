The fire consumed the house. Jeff, the last reader of my novella, which kept me remembered for all these years, died of smoke inhalation.

Stage 1
I met with Jeff on the other side. I was starting to fade, bodily. At this rate, I wouldn’t have ten days left to say goodbye.
What do all men who die young do? They spy on woman (at first).
Jeff caught a plane to Hollywood, and spied on the female movie stars.
“Don’t do this, Jeff,” I said, “You’ll regret not spending time with me, when you’ve wandered the Earth for longer.”
“You spied on girls, I bet,” said Jeff.
He had me there… of course, I did.

Stage 2
Jeff would be around for 15,000 years just like me. I’d read some of his writing. It was really rather good. A little naïve, lacking depth in knowledge of the opposite sex, but went as far as it could go without really analysis of human motives.
Jeff started to get depressed. He started to frequent opium dens, in China. He related to this. He also went to brothels, where the prostitutes worked for a pittance, and hated themselves despite the necessity of doing what they were doing; after all, they needed to be fed.
“Jeff,” I said, “Don’t bother going to dives… I did the same thing, and you end up looking for sweet moments… so why not save a tired, fading old man, and show him you are searching love, a prodigy, in this cracked, forlorn ghost-world.

Stage 3
As I faded, I saw Jeff venture from his opium dens, and search for love. He searched for birthday candles blew out, teenagers holding hands, marriage ceremonies, and watermelons, rockmelons, and grapes after school. He saw many things: widows, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. He tried to find every story on Earth: every interaction between the members of the human race in their diversity. I wanted to see more, but it was Jeff’s turn now. I’d had my turn.
