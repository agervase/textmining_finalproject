"So there is an afterlife," I said, surprised, looking out at the cloudscape around me. The sun was blazing out from behind a misty hill, cradling the vantage point in golden rays. The air smelled blue and fiercely refreshing. I tried stretching out my back; it didn't pop or ache as I was used to in life. It finally felt right. The omnipresent vice grip of anxiety was gone, and I felt content. In fact, my entire body felt well, and well suited to me.

I took a step forward. The ground was grey and spongy. Little wispy bits followed my foot as I lifted it and parted as it fell. It was like walking through... a cloud. Go figure.

There was a little strip lights in the ground, leading forward. Like the ones that light up the floor in a movie theater when the lights are off. I set off in that direction.

The colors were all the same and my depth perception was strange; I didn't notice the wall until I was inches from it. I tried to stop, lost my balance and tumbled forward, a cool sensation washing over me as I passed through into a new room.

I got up and dusted off my pants, looking around. The room reminded me of one of those little restaurant airlocks where they have pictures of bands, menus and posters for upcoming events plastered all over the wall. There was a doorway in the center what looked like reams of paper stapled to the wall, overlapping and edges curling. And with one exception, it seemed they were all blank. The one on top had words in big bold tacky font. It said:

#####CONFRONT your VICTIM
#####RIGHT the WRONGS
#####to ENTER HEAVEN

...

My victim...?

My wrongs...?

Fury twisted my gut. I let out a short laugh. The fury turned into anger and apathy. I don't care. I don't care I don't care Idon'tcare.

Then I grinned. It was obvious. Like a movie. Old St. Peter was going to conjure up the one I'd hurt most so I could atone for my sins.

What a joke. I walked through the doors.

The vice grip had returned somewhat, with the boiling anger. Now I felt more like me.

I walked through a cloudy hallway.

Was it my parents? They were godawful humans. I could see that now, with the clarity granted by death. This was there fault.

The hallway opened into an antechamber.

My girlfriend? Hah, *no*. I'd never had a girlfriend. Just keeping you on your toes.

There were two chairs arranged in the center.

Was it my teachers? My "friends"? A homeless guy whose pleas for cash I'd ignored?

Someone was already sitting in one.

No. What a joke.

I walked towards them, not caring who it was, not caring what I would say or do. I'd lost faith in the world.

I'd never gotten a single ounce of help in my life.

I withered and died, alone.

A stunted flower. A bad novel.

I would take on God himself in that chair if need be. What the fuck, God. Why did you let this happen. Why did you do this to me?  Why didn't you *help* me?  Why didn't you ***SAVE*** me? 

What a joke.

**The person who was HURT MOST is**

###ME.

...

**Me.**

I.

Of course. Understanding came a split second before I registered my victim's face, seated in the chair across from me.

Me.

The rage I'd felt before turned into pure, cold contempt. Black and oily, it coated my insides. I was the victim. God thought I had hurt myself, so he put me here in front of me expecting me to apologize and make good. Even better. I started preparing my poison, my hatred. Fuck them if they thought I would play their games. I looked into the eyes of my image staring across from me. I hated him most of all. I steeled myself to open my mouth.

"I just wanted to say," he said, getting there first. He lowered his eyes.

"I'm sorry."
