Farmer John was a simple man. He just wanted to tend to his herd, look after his crops, and be a good husband to his wife. He may not have been intelligent, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a man in town who disliked him.

After greeting the store clerk, John gathered his weekly groceries with relative efficiency, making sure to grab some extra milk seeing as Betsy wasn't feeling her best. He was about to pay when something caught his eye - the sweet section. Though he knew he shouldn't be wasting his money on such frivolous things, he figured just one treat couldn't hurt. 

He rummaged through the paltry selection, eventually finding a surprising item. He looked at it closely, putting on his glasses and reading it again just to make absolutely sure. Eventually, he threw it in his bag, going to the checkout. 

The clerk scanned through his items, abruptly stopping at the last one. He looked at it, then back at Farmer John.

"Johnny, you sure you want to buy this?" the clerk said, confused. 

Farm John smiled. "Oh, of course," he said, handing the clerk the money, "I've checked it twice, it's definitely fine."

The clerk was unconvinced. "I'm not so sure about that..." he said, slowly putting it into John's bag. 

"Now now, I've been alive long enough to know," he said, patting the clerk on the shoulder, "that they've got warnings for these sorts of things."

The clerk watched him go. He vaguely remembered some kind of new act or law that had been passed, but he was too high to remember the details.

John hit the floor, unable to breathe. His wife was desperately trying to find their medical kit, the empty packet still laying on the floor next to him.

Throughout it all, Farmer John was mystified. Even as he watched his life flash before his eyes, he was sure of it. He'd read it. *Twice*. 

That packet of peanuts hadn't said "WARNING: MAY CONTAIN NUTS" *anywhere.*
