She took a deep breath. 

*"Am I really about to do this?"*

Her reflection stared back from the dark blue glimmering paint job. Here sat that stupid fucking Mazda Miata she'd bought for her fiance. He'd landed his dream job, basically the new head honcho of Ashley and sons, and he'd done it with her help. He had the talent, sure, she recognized that. She also recognized the countless sleepless nights, review sessions, practice pitches and coffee runs she had participated in over the course of the last three years. 

**"I'll make partner and then this will all be worth it!"** 

She'd believed him. They had a dream together, and she was happy to support him in achieving it. Or at least she had been. 

An hour and a half, that's how long ago she'd gotten home early from her medical conference and gone around the back, headed for the back porch door so she could surprise him. If she knew anything about her fiance it was that Wednesday nights were for their dog, a glass or two of bourbon and a good movie, even when she was out of town. 

Imagine her shock when she turned the corner to see him with his legal aid. She froze. For several minutes she just watched, unable to move her now rooted feet from the spot where her life had started to fall apart. She saw what she needed to to know for certain. 

Lena had always been a woman with a strict code. When she was 23 she had vowed to herself to never again stay with a cheater, she'd attempted to put herself through that once before and at 28 she wasn't going to do it again. Finally, she moved. She grabbed the rake that laid against the back gate and headed for the front yard. 

*"Shit. What if they see me?"*

Again, she froze. While she stood there she noticed that he still hadn't raked the side yard. She huffed, *"Typical"*. She thought for a split second before beginning to rake them up herself. From the moaning she could hear coming from the kitchen window she wasn't too worried about them noticing her.

For the next 20 minutes she raked leaves into an immaculate pile on the edge of her side yard, stewing in the repulsion she had managed to find towards her ex-fiance. Internally Carrie Underwood was blasting in her brain, "Before He Cheats" lyrics pounding on her level of calm. Without really meaning to be, she was suddenly in front of his car. 

She took a deep breath.

*"Am I really about to do this?"*

She closed her eyes and thought for just one moment.

As she raised the rake, ready to strike at the car with the hard metal handle, she let out an exasperated "**Fuck it"**.
