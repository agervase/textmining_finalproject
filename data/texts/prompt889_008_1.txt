My mind blurs over as I look at the message. Blind panic overcomes, as I watch the others, and see their faces twist into the same shock as mine. One of them, however, has their eyes slitted slightly.

"We don't tell the others, and when the next three come for the message, we strike."

My head begins to pound wildly, and I pull away from the others, collapsing on the sand. Thoughts rush through my head. Everything began in wild distortion, as I saw the others go to work quickly. The two above somehow manage to get rid of the others quickly.

"He didn't fight..." One of the voices whispers.

"He's weak, he doesn't deserve to live."

I look up at the others, still stuck in a haze. Their words were distant, but I don't need words, when looking into a killers eyes. I get up, and carefully back away. I see the bloodied stick in one of their hands, and my mind reacts in horror, yet with the need for survival.

Running up, my hand thrashes wildly, and manages to grab the stick. As I get a hold, I quickly plunge it into the stomach of my attacker.

Breathing heavily, I look over at the other killer

"We are strong. In this place, we shall ru-" I cut the sentence off with a violent slamming.

Blood flows onto my hands. The neck is dressed beautifully in scarlet and crimson. My breath is served as I begin to hyperventilate.

"The poison shall kill all on this island, now it starts."

I look at the letter, and laugh uncontrollably. The poison on this island, was our own self preservation. I laugh again, and that quickly turns into a cough. My last moments are spent looking up, as a helicopter flies overhead. It begins to descend, yet in truth I know, it's far too late.
