For a solid 5 minutes I stood in shock. After I saw the threads I looked up and saw the spiders moving with him. When gained control of my body again I ran to the lab in our basement. And just as I thought, the super-intelligency potion flask was on the floor, broken and the liquid spilled on the floor. I must have bumped and dropped it while I was listening to music. 

Then it hit me, my husband. He is... No. It cant be.. He is.. dead. I have to run before they get me too.

Got my bag and ran through the front door to my car. As I start the car I saw my husband, well, he is not my husband anymore but I saw him. At the front door standing. Eyes closed. I think to myself that they did not think about the eyelids. He just fell on the ground. They dropped him.

I drove to my company, where I work as a scientist. I would have gone to the police but they would not believe me. So I came to the place where I can be trusted. I explained the situation. Then my supervisor pulled his phone from his back pocket, made a call and told me to go to the roof. I did what he said. There was a helicopter waiting for me. I got on and we took off.

The helicopter took me to the HQ of my company. The CEO greeted me when we landed. Asked me about my work and what happened. I told him that my work was about making a super-intelligency potion which makes the user, well, super-intelligent. And that the spiders got it now. He made some calls. Took like 10 minutes. Then told me its taken care of. I asked how. He said, we quarantined the entire zone, we are now checking everyone, stripping them naked and washing them in case any spiders get through. After everyone is evacuated we will burn the place down.

His voice was like he ate something and it somehow got stuck in his vocal cords. And his eyes were only halfway open. Was he sick or maybe, sleepy?

Then I saw it. The glint of light.. off the tiny.. threads.. again...
