It was all supposed just meant to be an experiment, having just seeing a documentary about micro nations, I couldn’t help but be curious. All you needed was, in order of importance: land, a system of governance, a constitution, a flag, a currency system/ exchange, passports, and a stamp. 

I already owned a small parcel of land in Ireland, inherited from a great grandfather, who had even been a lord in parliament or something. 

To be honest I didn’t really get exactly what my great grandfather title meant for me, as I had been born in America, but I had seven hectares of land that wasn’t really doing anything other than being rented farmland...so, check on land.

I drafted up a letter of independence, declaring myself Empress of my own micro nation, which I decided I would name “Xzyl”. 

I specified how the country’s name was pronounced like ‘Kyle’ and to mispronounce, or misspell its name would be considered a grievous insult to all the great citizenry of Xzylians. I even contacted the farmers on my land to let them in in on the gag, that if anybody asked they considered themselves citizens of Xzyl.

I drew up a gold and purple flag design and designed a neat looking currency, passport and stamp. I included all the information on where the land was located and sent the completed application to the UN, never expecting them to actually get back to me.

Then the response arrived.

“This letter is to notify; Empress Hayley Bancroft, the great and powerful, great granddaughter of Lord Horace Bancroft, the formal application of independence for your country of Xzyl has been recognized and Xzyl has been recognized as a sovereign state.”

It hit me like a ton of bricks... I had a country... and citizens... SHIT, I was an Empress...

A manic grin spread across my face, as all the possibilities started streaming through my mind. Time to visit Xzyl, and see what else I can accomplish there.
