*"One.... two..."*

School. They hate school. Of course they do, who doesn't? Little fucks. Hee hee hee...

*"...coming for you..."*

I formed the hallway to their math class, pulled them all into the dream. Watched them walking down the impossibly long corridor. Let them hear my laughter as if it were in the distance... oh I bet they were wishing I was in the distance. Heh.

*"Three... four..."*

I killed the lights. Watched them scrabble and scramble like rats.

*"Better lock your door..."*

They separated. They always separated. Stupid shits. I followed one, pretty black girl. Tasty, exotic. \*SLICE SLICE!* Now she was more red then brown. Heh heh heh.

*"Five... six..."*

The blonde bimbo next. Dropped some visions of her stepfather in front of her, the belt and the bottle. Made her run. Her balloon tits bounced nice when she ran. \*SLICE SLICE!* No more bouncing. I juggled them for her as she clasped her bleeding chest and screamed. HAHAHHA!

*"Grab your crucifix..."*

The computer nerd next. Scared of conflict, scared of bigger kids. Surrounded him with monsters dressed in football uniforms. Made them pull his limbs off. Let him lay there on the field just short of the goal line. Heh.

*"Seven... eight..."*

Three left. The dumpy fat girl next. May as well get the whale out of the way. Boring, bland, afraid of never being noticed. I put her on a stage, let her go to stage fright, before the spectral audience trampled her to death. Hee hee hee.

*"Better stay up late."*

The jock next, and his brother. I went for the kid first, seperated them. The little boy reminded me of glory days. Before I was what I am now. \*SLICE SLICE!* Too easy. Time for the bigger prey.

*"Nine... ten..."*

The jocky athletic guy was all that remained. Fear of failure, fear of not measuring up to his dad's stories of how great and amazing he was at his son's age. I put the kid in diapers, had him in the arms of his father. Let him have enough time being cradled like a baby to let his defenses drop... then the pillow. Held over his face, as his father yelled about how he'd never be good enough.

This one didn't die... he blinked out of the dream. Woke up. Dammit. But I smiled. 

*"Never sleep again..."*

I always got my targets in the end.
