I was soaked in sweat, snot, and tears, the fear almost hurt. I was squeezing myself in such a tight space that I could feel my chest seem to shrink, but I felt safe here. At least I wasn't with the rest of the hostages, I was under a pile of rubble that the explosion made. I tried to lie as still as I could, but it was inevitable. Sharpshot spotted me. Not surprising, now that I think about it. He does have advanced eyesight. He picked me up by the back of my coat and hauled me to my feet.

"HEY POISON!" He shouted to the villain in control of the hostages, "WE GOT A CIVVIE HERE, UNACCOUNTED FOR!"

^("WELL GET 'IM OVER HERE ALREADY") I heard faintly from the other side of the bank. Sharpshot sighed and pushed me along with a revolver to the back of my head.

"Alright, you slippery pile of dung," Sharpshot had a clear Australian accent, "you're comin' with me." I complied and probably looked like a shaking mess of bodily fluids while I was at it. Yes, including urine.

"Pathetic, really." Sharpshot whispered from behind me, "you do know I have advanced eyesight, right? Me finding you was gonna happen, no matter what you di-" Sharpshot got cut by something painful, judging by his groaning. Turns out, while walking I accidentally kicked a rock with my heel into his groin. My body took advantage of this before my mind could comprehend it and I punched him in the gut, making him drop his gun.

&#x200B;

We both realized the possibilities of the coming moments. I had the advantage, with him in pain, but when he stepped forward to grab it, he slipped in the puddle of urine that I made seconds before and fell. I was still in shock, but my body took action, grabbing the gun and shooting 5 rounds right into Sharpshot. I made a whole new puddle.

^("SHARPSHOT? SHARPSHOT? YOU THERE? SHIT, MIRAGE, CHECK IT OUT!")

"On it!" I heard from a soft female voice, which sounded nearby. I was still staring at the body of the villain. He looked like swiss cheese, if swiss cheese had blood and organs and was incredibly gory. The revolver stuck to my hand like glue. His dumb cowboy uniform was coated in a layer of blood. I felt even more coated in fluids then before, and with a whole new level of fear. Like fear that tore into my very being, fear that took my heart and stabbed it for every beat, fear that makes a man stick to the ground and be unable to move.

"You'll pay for that, you damn hero." Mirage was behind me. I knew it. I unfroze, this time with my mind intact, and turned to face her. There was five of her. Obviously holograms, but they were so realistic that I couldn't tell who was the real one. She and her four fake friends charged at me after a moment.

&#x200B;

As will soon be obvious, I wasn't thinking right. And thrown into a life-and-death situation with a revolver only containing one shot? It should've been clear what I should do. So, naturally, I threw the gun at the middle one, which went right through. Great move, I know. The thing is, though, that it happened to hit a wall and go off, hitting Mirage, the real Mirage, right in the head with a bullet. A third puddle was created right then. I ran right away. I didn't even pay attention to where I should go, I just ran, leaving a trail of sweat, tears, blood, and piss flowing behind me.

&#x200B;

Running randomly, you might expect that I would bump into something. You might not have expected that I would run into Poison, but I did, of course. Luckily, it was right when he was turning around, so I hit him really hard right on his gas mask, making it fall off. I don't understand why it was on so loosely, but it was good for me so I won't complain.

&#x200B;

I don't know how, but bumping into him made one of his gas grenades go off. I ran away while he coughed his lungs out and died. I sprinted, powered solely by fear to the entrance of the bank, where a swat team was waiting.

&#x200B;

"We heard gunshots, is everyone okay?" Said the man in front with a tough, commanding voice. For the first time since the beginning of the robbery, I spoke, although it was in a quiet and extraordinarily high pitched voice.

"Uh, yes, sir. I think. I, um, they're... the robbers, I-"

"Don't worry, young man. We'll get you outta here. Johnson, escort this kid outta here!" The man shouted to another officer. And like that, I had eliminated three extremely dangerous criminals and was outside the bank.
