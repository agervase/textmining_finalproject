It was Christmas Eve, in 2018. My parents dragged me out to dinner after my mother had nearly burnt the house down in an effort to make her famous Christmas ham. This was, of course, the first time that she had attempted to make it, and looking back, I have to give her credit for not giving up. By the time I was 13 in 2023, our house was the extended family destination for all holiday dinners, and by 2028 my mother had opened her own restaurant. That, however, is a different story, for a different time.

&#x200B;

But that night, in 2018, I was sitting at the table at Ruby Tuesday's, trying my best to stay within the lines of the snowflake coloring page the waitress had given me. My parents were drinking wine and talking about something, I don't remember what, when my mother stood up to go get her fill of the salad bar. My father took that opportunity to chug his third glass, and told me to stay put while he went to use the restroom. My mother would be back in a few minutes, he told me, and so I remained seated at the booth, choosing a new crayon to color the outer rim of my snowflake, and humming along with the rendition of Jingle Bells softly playing throughout the restaurant. 

&#x200B;

I didn't notice at first when a small woman sat down across from me. Until she spoke, "Hi Rachel. Pink for the outside of a snowflake? That's very creative." 

  
I was at first a little startled that this apparent stranger knew my name, and I was hesitant in my reply. My parents had taught me to always be polite, so I thanked her and kept coloring. She seemed very nice; her smile was warm and inviting, her hair a shimmering blonde, and her eyes wide and sparkling. She had a snowflake necklace on, which I thought to be the reason she might have wanted to say hello. 

&#x200B;

She then reached into her purse, and pulled out a tiny snow globe. Though it was only 2 inches tall, it was the most magical snow globe I had ever seen in my life; the interior showed a little girl that looked much like me, with brown hair and blue eyes, peering up at Santa and his reindeer flying throughout the night sky. She seemed pleased as I gaped at it in awe, and told me it was a Christmas present that Santa couldn't wait until tomorrow morning to give me. 

&#x200B;

"This present is special, though, Rachel. This snow globe is full of Christmas magic, and Santa thinks that you're the best person to keep it safe. Will you promise me that you will keep it safe as long as you live?"

&#x200B;

I obliged. At my age, I'd have said anything to get to hold that globe, let alone keep it. She stood up, glancing around briefly before leaning down and whispering, "On Christmas Eve in 2070 you will see someone who looks just like me, in New York City. You must give this snow globe to her in order to keep the spirit of Christmas alive. Can you do that?"

  
I gulped. That seemed like a lot of responsibility for an 8 year old to handle, but I nodded my head. With that, she turned, pulled on her hood, and quickly exited the restaurant. In a minute, my mother returned to the table.

&#x200B;

"Mommy, how long until it's 2070?"

&#x200B;

With the wine flowing, and my natural inquisitiveness shrouding the oddity of the question, she answered, "Well, I guess that would be in 52 years. Wow, can you imagine! You'll be 60 years old!"

&#x200B;

I relaxed a bit at that notion, having a lot of time to keep the Christmas magic to myself. I went to bed that night thinking of the small woman with the snowflake necklace. I imagined that she was an elf from the North Pole itself, and I vowed to never let her and Santa down.

&#x200B;

Throughout the years, I, like many adults before me, lost that notion. Around the age of 11 I learned from my parents that Santa was not real. And I began to chalk up that interaction in Ruby Tuesday's to some nice lady trying to spread a little bit of Christmas cheer. I went on to live my life; I became an accountant, married Jonathan, had children of my own. In 2065 my youngest daughter, Evelyn, had just gotten married herself, and moved to New York City after getting her dream job at the New York Times. By 2070, I had a total of four grand babies, and Evelyn decided to host a dinner to honor her grandmother's time old tradition of Christmas ham and family on Christmas Eve. Jonathan and I were packing for the trip when in the bottom of my sock drawer I spotted the snow globe from so many years before. After reminiscing a bit, I threw it in my purse, planning to give it to one of the little ones as a Christmas gift. 

&#x200B;

Jonathan decided we should take the subway into the city, but seeing as we hadn't done that in years, we got off at the wrong stop about 5 blocks from Evelyn's apartment building. It just started to snow, and the lights in the city were absolutely magical. So we walked. About a block from the apartment, we waited for the light to change to cross the street, when I tripped a little and dropped my purse. The contents spilled everywhere, and the snow globe rolled into the street right as the walking light came on. I don't really know what came over me, but I raced to get that snow globe. I picked it up and stood up triumphantly as Jonathan grabbed the rest of my belongings from the grimy city streets. It was then that I saw her. The small woman. Blonde hair, snowflake necklace, exact same soft smile and sparkling eyes that I had equated with elves so many years before. She hadn't aged at all. It looked as though she had stepped out of Ruby Tuesday's in 2018 right into this bustling street in 2070. She was crossing the street from the other direction with a hand outstretched towards me.

&#x200B;

I gasped, and held out the snow globe with trembling hands. She grabbed it in one swift motion, winked at me, cracked it open, revealing a small black device from within. She dropped the glass on the ground, and continued on her way into the crowd from which I just came. 

  
I had no idea what that snow globe contained, for all of those years. And that was apparently it. Was my entire life to that point was solely played out for that moment? I turned and ran after her, past my confused husband, desperate to find some type of answer to this question that I had never pondered until this point. 

&#x200B;

"Excuse me! Ma'am! Excuse me! What is that? Who are you? What is the point?!"

&#x200B;

She spun on her heels, looking rushed, "I'm so sorry! I forgot I have something for you in return, Rachel." She handed me a shoebox sized gift, ornately wrapped with a paper seemingly made out of snowflakes themselves. She turned again, headed on her way, as the wrapping melted in my hands, revealing an embellished box with my married initials on it. 

&#x200B;

I'm standing there in the streets. Perplexed and lost for words, I open the box. A note inside reads, "10 kg of platinum for your troubles. The future thanks you, Rachel, for keeping the secrets within the globe alive."

&#x200B;

Platinum was a precious metal I faintly remembered hearing about as a child. After the modern world cracked down on mining in an effort to thwart global warming, precious metals like platinum and gold were so rare that only the richest of the rich had any to their name. The governments had collected most of it for weaponry before the War of 2050, and to this day there is only a negligible amount sold in the finest jewelry stores in the world. A gram of platinum is worth $100,000. 10 kilograms? 

&#x200B;

I am now a billionaire.
