The room was bare. A light breeze drifted through the window and found its way to a lone body splayed on a dirty mattress on the floor. The body stirred a little, but made no motion to get up. A large gust of wind blew into the room and the window slammed shut. The body on the mattress opened its eyes and let out a brief sigh, before rolling over and getting to its feet. The floor was a maze of broken hypodermic needles and cigarettes butts. Paying little attention, the figure staggered out of the room with the occasional crunching sound in time with its footsteps. 12 Hours passed and it returned to the room once more and collapsed onto the mattress without a sound. 

<This is a broken soul> 

<Indeed>

<How long now?>

<Not long, patience young one.>

<Of course master>

The creature had been fumbling with one of its needles for some time and now had managed to get it into an exposed vein. As its breathing slowed down the temperature of the room began to rise. The light breeze that normally drifted through the window brought with it bellowing smoke and an aura of unease and dread. The room creaked as if it was screaming. A hooded being emerged from the smoke using its long spindly fingers to drag itself towards the mattress and the body lying motionless upon it. 

<This one is ours Death. You will leave it be.>

Death stopped and motioned with its bony finger at a watch wrapped around its wrist. 

<IT IS TOO LATE>

<We are here to heal this soul, you will not take it to the darkness>

<ONE SOUL MUST BURN.>

<Then you will take me instead>

<Master!>

<SO IT SHALL BE DONE>

Entwining its fingers around the master’s wrist, death dragged the him into the flames and the breeze quickly began to replace the smoke, and all became still once more. “Rise human”, said the lone Angel in a soothing tone. The creature bolted upright, visibly shook. “Who the fuck are you bro? Who let you in here?” “My master has sacrificed himself to save thee from the eternal hellfire.” The human whipped out a switchblade and placed it to the angel’s throat. “Ima cut you bro, I’m serious don’t start no trouble.” He yelled. “You cannot harm me human, we are one now.”
