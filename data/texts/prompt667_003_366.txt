Christopher Wilson had heard the stories surrounding Shutdown Day from a very early age. You get into the hibernation-pod, a hissing sound starts, you feel a chill and then you wake up in the future, simple. But Christoper didn’t wake up in the future, because he never fell asleep.

Christopher hit the grimy glass from the inside of the pod, “Help! I think something’s wrong! Anyone?”

He could make out rows and rows of the white-black hibernation-pods, too many to count. No one came to his rescue, despair churned in his stomach like a ragged stone-wheel. He thought that this was it, he was going to die, surrounded by his fellow humans, by those who loved him, but completely alone.

The pod hissed, “Finally!”, but to his surprise there was no mist to carry him into better days, it was the hatch that opened, the pod tilted slightly to help him disembark onto the metal-grating platform. 

A terrible realization washed over Christopher as he considered what this meant, if he couldn’t find a way to enter the deep sleep, then his life would still be forfeit. The only remains left for his wife and daughter, a shriveled corpse. Determined to avoid this fate, he went in search for a control room, perhaps there would be instructions on how to fix his pod.

After walking for several minutes on the suspended walkway, he came across a door that led into a hallway painted in red, thick black letters indicating where he was going, “Control room 12B should be this way, finally some luck!”

He allowed himself some excitement as the door slid open without protest, a large computer-screen blinked to life, it took up most of the wall-space inside, two smaller screens on arms protruded out at him, statistics about system-operation happily danced across them.

Christopher searched using the large computer-screen and quickly found some general manuals describing the hibernation process. He knew the reason they even hibernated in the first place was because of overpopulation and energy concerns, because of this there likely wouldn’t be any extra pods for him to enter, maintenance was his only option.

*In case of catastrophic core failure, the pod will enter fail-safe mode and eject the user from the faulty device. The compromised core must then be replaced, and the system must be rebooted and re-configured by hibernation-system professionals.*

Christopher hung his head low, facing the translucent keyboard, the cores were heavy and dangerous to handle alone, and he was no hibernation-system professional. He clung onto some small hope that he could overcome this obstacle, but he knew it would be nigh-impossible. Furthermore, the pods were not designed for users to wake up before a hundred years had passed, the process sent the body into a near-dead state and would cause serious damage if the user was prematurely ejected. Which meant he couldn't find and wake one of these experts, either.

He walked back to his pod, he watched his wife and daughter sleeping. His beautiful family. He put his hands on the glass-windows, “I am… sorry. My only realistic option is to enter the wasteland in search of someone who could help me, someone who’s still awake. It’s likely that we will never see each other again, Anya,” he turned his head, tears dripping down his cheeks, “Elle, daddy is going to do his very best… so that we can see each other again, but should I fail, I need you to be strong for mother.”

Christopher stepped away from the pods, “I love you both, I’ll… I’ll see you soon.”

After saying his farewells, Christopher stepped out into the blazing light, and began the journey that would be remembered for generations to come.
