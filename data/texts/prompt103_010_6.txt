It all started with a note, with "I know ehat you did" written on it in perfect penmanship, and marked with a kiss.

I've spent the last 150 years tracking down and killing my soulmates maintaining my immortality. By now, I've barely gained a year in accumulated time between first meeting them and executing the perfect murder. Absolute genius! 

But... Normally the universe finds a way to get the two of you together. Late for a subway on the way to work, you lock eyes accross a packed car. After moving to a new city to follow your dreams, you visit a bar and see her eyes accross a smoky room. Everytime, you can feel the thunderclap in your heart. But after my 169th kill, it stopped. Nothing. Not even a palpitation. Barely any eye contact. I wasn't sure to relax and live my life as the universe had given up on me, or to stay on edge, because at any second I could still meet them... 

Then I got that note. No return address, just slipped under the door of the backwoods cabin I'd decided to hide in. I immediately packed my bags and got ready to leave, booking a flight for the next day, expecting the police to come investigate me about the murders. But the next morning, walking out to my taxi, I saw the second note â€” "It's alright, I'm doing it too. May we never meet" signed with the same kiss.

I don't know how they did it, how they could have found me without us seeing each other but... Clearly I've left enough of a trail to be followed. I still took the taxi, still flew to Hawaii, where I've always wanted to throw someone in a volcano in a pinch, but I wrote on the back of that note "How!?". I knew they'd find me again. But this time I'd make it easy, the more we knew about each other, the less likely we were to 'meet'.

And thus began the most terrifying correspondence of my life.
