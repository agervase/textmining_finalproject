Eric put down the 'burger' and sighed and stared wistfully at nothing in particular. He was old, 136, and could still remember how red meat tasted.
     "If I could just have a real, honest burger, maybe I'd stick around a bit longer," his wife, Deana, regarded him with pursed lips.
     "It's selfish, Eric! Don't expect me to tag along. Why can't you try to make the best of it? We've never had it so good!" Eric didn't really catch any of it.
     The next morning Eric nearly fell asleep reading the 'news'. There was a time when the news would keep you up at night! He sipped his orange juice. It was good. But, it was just orange juice... nothing to get so excited about. Certainly nothing to live over.
     "You coming with, Deana?" He called into the den where he last saw her.
     "To watch you end it all?" She was furious.
     "I'll be waiting for you" he loved her.
     Eric stepped into a pod and bobbed up and down and around through the winding tubes that carried folks from one end of the arcology to the other. It was a beautiful world that had been born from the singularity. Beautiful, safe, prosperous... and boring. He'd seen enough.
     "136 is fairly young, are you sure you are ready to leave?" The concierge regarded Eric with a mix of sympathy and disdain... a strange mix, but there it was.
     "Oh yes, I'm ready"
     The suicide chamber was very comfortable. The lights were dim, and barely audible music soothed him on a subconscious level. The large, plush chair had a relaxing scent, and hugged his body. The air began to grow thin and Eric became tired. As Eric drifted off the brain scanner in the ceiling completed the mapping of Eric's consciousness. 
     "Huh," Eric thought/said, "I wonder where I can get a burger."
