I was ill for a long time. Ill for most of my life. I'd never seen the world outside my village, only once been to the outskirts as a young child.

And now, as the sun rose, my body grew cold. 

As my eyes fell heavy I heard a knock at the door. My parents? Couldn't be, they had left for work at least an hour before. With how expensive my medicine was, they couldn't afford to miss it. Whoever it was, they should have known better. I was bedbound most of the time. How was I supposed to answer?

A dark mist seeped in. I then realized it needed no invitation.

The glint of metal. The creeping calm. My heart slowed in response, and I scowled in turn.

Death extended a withered hand in invitation. 

I slapped it away.

"I'm not going! Not yet! It's not fair!" I tried to cry out, but it came as barely a whisper.

Death seemed understanding. Compassionate, even. The mist from its cloak swirled around me in an embrace.

So I fell, tumbling out of the bed and onto the floor. Grasping and clawing at the wood as my vision continued to fade.

"You're not taking me..."

My hands searched for something, anything to grab onto for stability in the encompassing darkness. Finally, they found it. Hand over hand, I pulled myself up with all of my strength.

And then I could see again.

And it was warm.

I remembered how to breathe and the world was still my own.

Death took its hands off of the scythe. Then, it removed the blade. Leaving me with the staff alone, it disappeared. And somewhat, I was healed.

I winced in pain. That part needed time, I supposed. It would be hard to walk. But with the support, it shouldn't be as hard this time.
