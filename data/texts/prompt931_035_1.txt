[Excerpt from GQ's interview with Rand Michaels, winner of the 2089 Hitler Killathon]

[...]

GQ: So, Mr. Michaels, I guess it took you a lot of thinking to come up with a creative enough strategy to win the trophy, right?

RM: Actually, It was a rather simple idea, I wonder why nobody else thought about it.

You see, I jumped to Berlin right around the time of the London bombings, so the Brits' hatred of Hitler was very high; I managed to sneak inside his compound with my cloaking device and, when I was finally alone with him-

GQ: Where?

RM: In the bathroom, of all places; That's right, I watched Adolf Hitler take a dump! [chuckles]

GQ: Oh my! It must have been a strange spectacle.

RM: It certainly was for me; you know, [looks out the window] when you come across these larger-than-life historical figures, it's really hard to imagine them doing the most mundane things. I mean, would you think about, say, president West brushing his teeth? It really shook my perception of history.

[pauses]

But anyway, back to killing Hitler! [smiles] As I was saying, I watched him do his business and, just as he was getting up to flush - before he could even pull up his pants - I knew I had to act quickly.

GQ: And what did you do?

RM: You know, a simpler man might have just shot him then and there. A more vengeful man might have drowned him in his own piss and shit. Instead, I grabbed him and teleported.

GQ: Where?

RM: Why, right to his enemies! I teleported him, still butt naked,  inside Winston Churchill's Xenu-damned office! [laughs heartily] 

GQ: [laughing] OH MY GOD!

RM: I know, right? [laughing] both their faces were priceless! Hitler was terrified and Churchill... Well, good ol'Adi over there was practically mooning him! [returns serious] I don't think I have to tell you what the guards did to him. Or to his corpse.

GQ: I can imagine that.

RM: So that's that. That's how I won the '89 Hitler Killathon trophy.

GQ: Wow, a really great story; thanks for the laugh, Mr Micheals.

RM: My pleasure.
