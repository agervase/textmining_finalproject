Charles McGuffery's life was normal and boring as all hell, just how he liked it. He had his cookie cutter house, his cookie cutter car, his cookie cutter wife. Damn, he even had the crusts off his sandwiches cut off. Strange voices in the dashcam footage of his car was not part of the plan.

&#x200B;

"Your skin looks so sweet and succulent. Oh yes, yes, yes. Just a taste, if only I could taste, yes." The woman sounded mad, absolutely mad. His skin? Did she want to lick him or something?

&#x200B;

That was the hundredth hour of footage like that. The entire time through, that voice was non-stop. Charles was just trying to find out when it all started. Maybe he if he found out where, his life could go back to normal. The slightest deviation, especially one like that, caused Charles to go into a panic. It was the search that kept him from breaking down now, as freaked out as he was, there had to be an explanation for this... there just had to be.

&#x200B;

"Why, hello there little piggy. You sure look scrumptious. Yes, yes you do piggy."

&#x200B;

Hour two-hundred fourteen, the time stamp said the date was October the fifth, where was he that day? What had he done? His went through the day for the third time, his eyes moved through the video... Nothing, he had done nothing, nothing unusual anyway. He went to work, got on the parkway as he always did, took the same exit, stopped for gas as the same gas station he always did, and drove home the same way. He rewound the video to the exact moment the voice started and looked around the screen for some hint of an answer. Faintly and fuzzily, in the background was a funeral procession, no doubt about it. This couldn't have been something as simple as that?

&#x200B;

"Eat the flesh, cook the flash, rip and tear the flesh from its bones, yes. Here piggy, piggy."

&#x200B;

Charles' face went white. He muted his computer but the voice kept going. 

&#x200B;

"HERE PIGGY PIGGY. GIVE ME ITS FLESH, LITTLE PIGGY." A cool breeze came from the computer screen.

&#x200B;

The walls moved and cried as the voice screeched and Charles McGuffery covered his ears in desperation. There was no way the missus didn't hear that, yet, she did not come crashing in the door. She would not have let something as loud as this slide in her home, even if it was by Charles' design. Louder and louder the screech grew. It was unbearable, it was so painful, his head felt it would explode. There was a small popping in his head, almost like popping a bubble of chewing gum, and all went quiet. When Charles moved his hands from his ears and gazed at them, they were covered in blood.

&#x200B;

"Honey?" Charles McGuffery called to his cookie cutter wife. 

&#x200B;

Funny, he said the words but couldn't hear them.

&#x200B;

"Honey?" He said even louder. Again, he could hear nothing. 

&#x200B;

Fuck. His ear drums must have blown. He couldn't hear a whistle. Looking as his hands again, he cried. What was happening? Why was this happening? He never hurt a soul.

&#x200B;

"*Give me its flesh, little piggy*." He heard faintly whispered from behind him. No, he couldn't hear, his ear drums had just blown, he was sure. But that voice cut through to his soul.

&#x200B;

Charles screamed out as he felt invisible teeth sink into his neck. He swore he could hear giddy laughter as his vision faded to black. *Good little piggy.*
