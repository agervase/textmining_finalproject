"In 2070 I would be 99 years old!"

"What of it?"

"Well, it's a tenuous bet, don't you think?"

A shrug. "Maybe, what's that gotta do with anything?"

Eyeroll, then, a tired sigh. "What are you, a five-year-old, do I have to spell it out?"

"No and no." A sharp inhale through clenched teeth. "You just have to wait for the right time and then tell Jonny what I told you."

Exasperated, "Like I said, 99, " a beat, "this ticker is not gonna last that long."

"It doesn't matter, no offence."

Shocked, "What, do I turn into a zombie and deliver the message that way?"

"Of course not, Zombies don't exist, jeez."

"But how..?"

"For the love of baloney, I jost toled it to you."

"Huh, whass dat?"

"My apologies, stress tends to bring me out in nostalgia."

"Um, OK, but I still don't get it."

"What are you not getting?! You wait, then it's 2070, you meet up with Jonny, he tells you the password, which is 'Hello gorgeous', you pass on the message from me, '34 St Vincent Boulevard' and that's it. What is unclear about all of that?"

Silence. A sound of a shoe tapping.  "Why can't you do it yourself?"

"Because I will be at 34 St Vincent Boulevard, wrapped in saran and in need of defrosting."

"Hang on, if you are..will be..does that mean I am..will become?"

"A time traveller."

"But how? Shouldn't I know about it? Why don't I know about it? How come you know about it and I don't ?" 

Awkward silence. "You are not one yet. Like I keep saying, you gotta wait for the right time. And don't ask me when that is, because I can't tell you. All I know is that I need a break and your son, Jonny, came to see me sometime before you were born to tell me to find you on this day and tell you when to tell him about where to find me. So that's where we are. That's all I know. Don't ask me anything else because I don't know anything more than that. All right?"

"We'll see."

Footsteps.
