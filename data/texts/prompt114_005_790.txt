The building began to shake. The produce the man shelved fell onto the floor and he stepped on it as he began to walk towards me.

"It's a shame, I have found enjoyment being among you humans for the past 500 years. I guess that I must relocate again."

"Wait, what? I didn't mean to say Dracula, why would I say Dracula? Mr. Dracula." I fell to the floor and covered my mouth.

"Look you can't even stop yourself, you discover who I am then confront me so boldly, the fall to the floor and piss yourself".

I looked down and saw my own shame mix with the berry juice beneath his feet.

"It's really not like that Mr. Dracula, you see since I was young I've been able to know people's names just from looking at them and recently it's gotten really bad, I can only call people by there names. You see my gift has turned... turned into a curse."

The building stopped shaking. The patrons continued to stare at us. I could smell my piss and Dracula rolled his eyes. 

"Fine, look get up... my wife will be here in two hours to pick me up, you're coming with. Go sit in the employee lounge. I have a change of clothes in there... they should fit you. Throw your pissed stained underwear away before you put on my good jeans."

He looked down at his feet, then at me. His nose then wrinkled in disgust and he frowned. 

"You know what fuck it." He looked at the patrons. "Everyone vampires are real , I'm Dracula the dumbfuck who pissed himself is probably a second generation elf and none of you are going to remember any of this when he gets two miles away. Don't mind taking any photos of me they won't work. You'll just have a photo of a sad young man on the ground in a puddle of shame and disappointment. " 

"What do you mean they won't remember?"

"When elves shit themselves in fear they release a toxin that wipe human memories. It's how they've survived persecution for the past 5,000 years."

"What I didn't"........ "oh".

"Change of clothes in the break room"

"Thank you mr. Dracula"
