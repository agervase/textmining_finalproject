Mom told me of a time when the world where trees would grow everywhere, the land where filled with lush green grass can be seen inside the city. It was a paradise she says. Now everywhere I turn I see people, large metal houses in the sky. No plants no trees. Me? Dad says I’m a mistake, I didn't understand. Mom took me outside the city. She says we don’t need dad. I still miss him sometimes.

One day moms friend gave her a dog and I named him Greg. And I don’t know what came over me one day, but I hugged it so tight and he squealed and suddenly it didn’t move. I thought to myself ... "Did I break our dog?" panicked I called my mom. Her expression says it all. That mix of shock and confusion in her face. She passed the room. She didn’t know what to do. This was the first time that something like this happened. She touched the dog and there was no response. She doesn’t know whether to tell people or to hide the fact that I broke our dog.

My mom tells me that I have a gift, a gift that would end the suffering of the world. But if I had such a gift then why would my own mother hide me away? I wondered as a little child too young to understand the ways of the world. One day we went to an old shack in the far stretches of town that we lived in. Mom told me it’s for a friend. I was to kill their oldest member of the family. The old granny could barely see or talk nor stand up, it was to be a mercy. Everyone looked on my special power. Needless to say, I got the job done. Silence. It was quiet after what I did what I had to do. It felt weird. It didn’t feel natural. It wasn’t right.  But my mom made a profit of it. Of course, people would like the sweet escape of death. so ... day in and day out that’s what I was tasked to do. to snuff out the candles of the suffering. I ran away.

Fast-forward a few years, I was on the run from the government. They wanted to test on me, and when they refused I killed my pursuers one by one. Only I could do it, only I could kill people now, eventually on my own I didn’t really have that much of an experience doing anything else, People knew who I was, so might as well make a profit right? But along with the death I carve in my wake lies the burden of knowing the lives that I have taken away. Where do they go? what happens to them when I’ve killed them? I make it a point to kill the ones that suffered the most. It was only humane to do it. But soon enough people kept giving me bigger and bigger offers to kill their enemies, like I’m some sort of machine, a mercenary, they gave me a nickname of olden times "The Grim Reaper".

Eventually eons came with me killing people and slowly, the feeling of killing makes me into a cold and uncaring creature that sole purpose is to remove the persons existence. It’s weird really. I stopped taking in offers. I took what I want, whenever I want, and none could stop me. What are they gunna do? Kill me? Hah! Slowly I honed my craft. And the people started to fear me. I paid a visit to my dad, and as I curse him as I resent the years I grew up without him feeling abandoned and uncared for, a pool of blood begins to form right where he stood, as I plunge my knife towards him, I saw a reflection of myself, for a second I thought I saw bones instead of flesh. I became the avatar of death.

I whimper as I stare into the abyss of the freezing lake of which I spent my childhood on, dried bloodstains on my hand, exhausted by the "I can't take this anymore" as I jump and crash into the cold dark waters, as I plunge, it was calm, it was serenity in its purest form. As finally I may be able to rest my weary heart to try to end it all.

&#x200B;

That would have been the end of the story, or so I thought. I wake up in the hospital shackled, confused, and trapped in this cylindrical chamber of amniotic fluid like substance unable to move, I panic and thrash around, doctors and nurses come to my aid, as it finally dawns on me, the only person I can't kill....

&#x200B;

is myself.
