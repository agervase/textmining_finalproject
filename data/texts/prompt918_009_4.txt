April sighed in exasperation and pushed her glasses up with the back of her hand.
" I'm sorry Terrance, this usually doesn't happen to me. We are going to have to try again."
Terrance nervously shifted in his chair; his tattooed face showing only the slightest emotion. "That's ok, Doc. But you know I always kinda hated needles." April carefully prepared another syringe. "Terrance, I'm going to need you  to tell me about your childhood again. Just start from wherever you feel is appropriate. It will help me concentrate. Do you think you can do that?" The  muscular man nodded slowly, cooperating. "Well, you know about my step-father Doc. And how he abused me and my sister.  I ran away as soon as I could, my only regret was that I left my sister with that Bastard." April could tell by the tone of his voice that Terrance was becoming more agitated but she urged him to continue anyway. "I lived on the streets, I had to steal from people just to survive." It was difficult to watch this once intimidating man break down. He continued his story with tears streaking down his face. "... and I wish things could have been different. It was an accident you know I was careless that time. But I know all that no matter how  sorry I am it won't bring that man back." April took a deep breath, "that's enough Terrance,  thank you." She gripped the syringe,  ready to inject the prisoner. "Wait..." Terrance pulled out a piece of crumpled paper from the pocket of his orange jumpsuit. "I wrote this for his family. Could you give this to them?" April jabbed the lethal cocktail into Terrance and he lost consciousness. The apology letter he had written slipped out of his hands onto the floor. That night, no one slept soundly on death row.
