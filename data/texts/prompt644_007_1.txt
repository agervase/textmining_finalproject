The day I graduated from high school my life went off the rails crazy. It happened so suddenly I nearly had a heart attack. 

I was walking on to the stage to accept my diploma, as usual my dad wasn't there. I faked a smile as my step mother took a photo of me, and grabbed the document. Out of nowhere a bully women tackled me to the ground. 

Dazed, I shook my head and opened my mouth to scream at her. Before I could she pulled me up and gave me a once over, after buddy her head she turned around and ran away.

Everyone stared at me, just as shocked as I was. Taking a deep breath, I calmed my racing heart and tried to pretend nothing had happened.

I figured it was a once in a lifetime, crazy experience but it kept happening, again and again and again. Every single day it happens, never at a consistent time, and never the same person. I'm twenty-two now, I just graduated from college and it hasn't happened today, yet.

After leaving my job as a publicist for my dad's company for the day, I made my home to my small loft. 

Suddenly I heard the familiar running, and I dodged the tall man coming at me. I then started running as fast as I was able to, towards my loft. I was almost home, just a block away. Running faster then I thought I could, I made it home.

I heated up a microwave dinner, to tired to cook, and finally started to relax. 

Then, before my eyes, my tortellini went up in flames. 

The door to my loft flew open, and someone shot me. The last thing I saw was my delicious pasta burning.

I blinked multiple tones until I saw a strange woman starting down at me. 

"Nice to meet you Sandra Pyrat."
"What the heck is going on!" I yelled.
"Don't worry everything's fine, we put our your fire, and brought you to a disclosed location. You can call me Taylor. I recommend you stop talking so I can explain everything quickly." I glared at her, but nodded my head. It was better to know what was going on anyway."Great. I'll start with who, or really what you are. You are what's called a fire elemental, it's what it sounds like. Those people who kept tackling you, they were protecting you, from others and yourself. Whenever they talked you down they would inject you with a painless potion that supresed your abilities that you manifested the day you turned eighteen. But now that you didn't receive an injection you'll be hunted. I know it's a lot, and at the same time but enough information, but the rest is classified. I can only tell you if you join me. I work for a secret organization that trains people like you to control your powers, and to help protect the world from hunters and other enemies. Again that's all I can tell you, if you want to go back to your old life you can, we'll help you with that. But, if you want a chance to be so much more then you ever thought you could be, join me. You just have to say yes."

I thought about it, this had to be the biggest decision I'd ever have to make. But something in my gut told me to choose the right path.

Looking directly into Taylor's eyes I nodded my head.
