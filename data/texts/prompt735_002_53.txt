The others dentists call me a cynic, pessimistic, and pedantic hypocrite. How could toothpaste not work when so many people had flawless white teeth?

I ignore their foolery. They are naught but blind buffoons, sold to the corporations, brain-washed by the government. Of course the toothpaste would make people's teeth white, what they didn't tell you is it destroyed them in the process. Those awful minty pastes are full of chemicals and artificial poisons.

Why do you think dentists make a great living? All those dental problems people have are because they brush their teeth with toothpaste. Believe me. They clean up your teeth, make them shine bright as the moon. They fool you into thinking they are perfectly sane, but when you understand the process taking place, you realize the toothpaste is slowly eating your precious teeth from the root.

I'm not a renowned dentist and I don't have a ton of clients, but that's not due to my lack of capacity, but to my knowledge and unbendable honesty. I told every customer of mine the secret for healthy white teeth. That's the reason I didn't have many of them. Because I only needed a session to repair their teeth forever.

Now, hear me out. If you want bright, sane teeth, simply cut a leaf of aloe vera, and milk it on a bowl. Once you have a decent amount of that sweet green liquid, you mix it with an infusion of apple and ground rhubarb. The aloe will whiten the teeth while the apple and rhubarb will strengthen the enamel. The only thing lacking here in that recipe is something to protect the root. But the solution is simple. You simply add a spoonful of—.  

*Knock*

*Knock*

God, who's knocking at my door this early in the morning? Be right back.

"Hello? Who's there? What? I don't know anyone by that name. No, I won't sell your stupid toothpaste! You greedy, lying bastards. I swear someday the world will know of your scam. I swear it to my na—"

*Bang bang*
