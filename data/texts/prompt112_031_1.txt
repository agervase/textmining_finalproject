There was another prompt I saw a year or two ago that was of a similar premise. I don't write stories, per say, but I do write songs for my band. Unfortunately, we can't make songs as fast as I can write them.. but I digress. I will still change it around until it becomes *something*, but I wanted to give it a whirl. I put more of a negative spin on it.

&nbsp;

If only you knew the damage you do

When you keep me alive in your mind

If only you knew I'd be begging

Pleading and screaming to be left behind

&nbsp;

Just let me die!

&nbsp;

Cuz the agony rips me apart

What I wouldn't give to back to the start

Erase all my impact

Remit all the conquests and missions I undertook

All the lesser men I have known

Have moved on to their final home

But here I remain

Breathless and lifeless

Begging for pain

&nbsp;

Just let me die!

Just let me die!

&nbsp;

Just let me die

And believe it's okay to let go

This life laced with meaning

Has left me alone

Desperately hoping for treason

With nothing to show

Just call out my name no more

End the purgatory I endure

End all the pain

Next step surrender

I'm going insane

&nbsp;

Just let me die!

Just let me die!

&nbsp;

Just let me die

Why must my tunnel be longer than the rest

The light at the end is so small

A pin prick of white on a blackened wall

The freedom no one will unleash

Is the final evasion of peace

If you all would just let me die

I can finally be alive

&nbsp;

I want to go home

Whatever my home will be

To wherever this uncontrolled outcome will please

To whoever is waiting for me
