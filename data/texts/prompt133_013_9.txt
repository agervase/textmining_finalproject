If only you knew how boring life gets when you exceed the standard mortality ratio. You wouldn't fear death, you would embrace it. They say the greatest drug of them all is love. Imagine how boring love gets when you've fallen in love more times than you can count, either to break up or just see your loved ones die.

Death is a real bitch, not dying, I mean the entity we call Death. I stepped on his god damn cloak a few thousand years back and now I'll never know death. The only death I know is the petty, spiteful asshole whom cursed me to never know his sweet kiss, instead I was bestowed with his abominable curse.

I know, you're thinking I'm a real complainer and whiner "oh woe is me, I'm gonna live forever and I'm crying about it." I would like to point out that immortality is one of the most over glorified ideals in the history of mankind. We live for a certain amount of time, we learn and we die. We're not supposed to be here forever. I'm not supposed to be here forever. Where is the justice in this and where the hell is God? Isn't he supposed to set all things right? Who the hell is death accountable to?

One thing that never really gets old when you live this long is seeing the evolution of beer. I'm writing this at a brewery now, this red ale tastes better than anything we could brew going back a couple millenia. Anyway back to Death being accountable. If he accounts to no one than how do I solve this dilemma? I stepped on his cloak and the petty fuck won't take me. I believe I'll find him, for if he accounts to no one, I will find a way to make him account for me.
