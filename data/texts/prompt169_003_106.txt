>*God sat forward, pinching the bridge of his nose.*

**G:** "One day. I left you in charge for ONE. DAY. HOW did this happen?!"

>*Isaac sat back in his chair, with his feet resting crossed upon the opulent desk. His expression beaming with smugness and amusement, he slowly unwrapped a Jolly Rancher and popped it in his mouth.*

**I:** "Why are you asking me? I know our omniscience doesn't apply to higher dimensional branes like this office, but you obviously can already see everything that happened during your break. Are you asking *Why*?"

>*The fuming expression becoming more apparent by the second, God slams his hands on the desk, a colossal boom of sound echoes like a mighty clap of thunder from the action.*

**G:** "Don't even BEGIN to get arrogant boy. I am your CREATOR. I know WHAT you did, I want to know WHY."

>*Isaac brings his feet down from the desk. He pulls himself into a more professional posture, trying his best not to look like an arrogant prick while explaining his triumph over LITERALLY God.*

**I:** "Well it's simple. I looked at it much like a math equation. I listed out all the problems I saw in the world, all the positive aspects of the universe, and all things holding humanity back from progress into three lists. I also, um, not to offend, but I also made a list of all the things I figured you could have done... well, better. Honestly, being here, I understand you a lot better, but I still think your approach has much to be desired. See, you pulled a Physicist in to do your job, so I obviously approached it as a damn physicist would."

"First I took on the issue of humanities Theological arguments. I appeared to all of humanity at once, and explained to them the nature of their existence, the Universe, and, well, You. Obviously this came with plenty of stubborn religious fanatics up in arms trying to dispute my "Godly" nature, blaming it on everything from extraterrestrials to bigfoot, so I simply appeared to each individual for a one-on-one talk for it. Basically, I brought judgement to humans early. While I would have loved to forcibly change all the humans with vile natures to be loving and caring individuals, that unfortunately goes against your only set rule of "Free Will" (yeah right), so I simply did as *my* god did, and Smited them."

>God stares at him, equally exasperated and unimpressed.

**G:** "So you individually went through and smited every single human you didn't like?! Global mass murder and REVEALING God to the flock was your brilliant damn plan?!"

**I:** "Wait, wasn't it you who forbade swearing in the first place?"

**G:** "Don't get snippy with me you shit."

**I:** "Right. Anyways, with ignorance out of the way, I was busy with curiosity myself. I mean, one day my ass, time is meaningless from here. We literally sit several dimensional branes above their universe. I knew that time and space were interconnected, but I wanted to push the boundaries and see what other theoretical walls I could find to abuse. After playing around with Time, Black Holes, Quantum Entanglement, Causality, and a literally finitely infinite list of other physics theories I've always dreamed of testing, I developed a fairly polished 'Theory of Everything'. 11 dimensions my ass, there's an infinite^âˆž Dimensions to this Omniverse. 11 for this Universe though."

**G:** "I... 11? Really?"

**I:** Yeah. Wait, you didn't know? Even humans have been theorizing that for a while now. Well, regardless, I then Published several thousand papers for humanity to mull over for a while. Including plans to many extremely complicated devices, one of which being plans for a transfusion device to allow the transfer of a conscious Human "Soul" from a simple 3 Dimensional body into higher dimensional states. Meanwhile, most governing bodies were in complete disarray, since the majority of the world leaders had been smitten for wickedness and corruption. I stepped in and helped personally found a much larger collaborative true democratic system, filling loopholes and leaving different governing bodies for 'countries' and 'states', but all working together as a global system of cooperative decision making, leaving nobody with excessive power."

**G:** "Yes yes, but this was ONE DAY that I was gone. HOW did so much happen in ONE. DAY.?!"

>*Isaac, taken aback by the sudden outburst, stares almost stunned at his creator for a moment before responding.*

**I:** "...Oh my You. You seriously don't even know what the hell you've been doing do you? "One day"? Time is meaningless! You gave me omnipotence over this universe. Yes, you were GONE for one day, but that was only from your perspective. You don't even know the FIRST THING about relativity do you? I simply hit the fast forward button on the universe's time dilation in comparison to the office here. I just actually stayed in that universe instead of wining and dining here in some luxury God penthouse being useless."

"Thousands of years have passed God. Humanity came and went. I fixed things. I uplifted them. Brought them to our level. The human civilization has now integrated with 1746th Dimensional Multiverse culture."

>God stared blankly at Isaac. A look of sadness and utter defeat floods his face. Tears begin to pour down his cheeks. 

**G:** They... Y-You...    You ruined everything. Free will... Sin and choice... all that work for nothing. You ruined my plan for them...

>Isaac furrows his brow in confusion

**I:** "Whoah, hey, what's with that reaction? I mean, i'm aware that it might be hard to be shown up, but that's nothing to be so upset over."

**G:** "But.. my creation.. it's all gone."

**I:** "Huh? Since when? It's all fucking right here. Do you even get how a Multiverse works? I fixed your viewing console to see different areas in probability-space as well. Here, this one is a universe basically exactly like the one you left me with yesterday. What, did you think I wouldn't keep track of your save file?"
