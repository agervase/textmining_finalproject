I've apparently been allowed to start remembering my repeats... I'm not sure why. I've never woken up with more than a 2 on my hand. But that's not important, I had agreed to meet with Kayla at the park.

She had her cat! She always brought her cat with her, every time we met. It was kind of cute in a way. I sat on a swing next to her.

"You know, James?" She asked me, "I've never been a big fan of Summer time."

"Really? Why's that?"

"It's always so hot! Why can't it be- MIKU!"

She jumped after her cat. I don't know what compelled it to run, but she chased, and I followed. Right across the street, as Kayla ran after it. That's when it happened.

The accident was no bigger than any other accident I'd seen. As much as I hated them, the fact that people could re-start their day meant that it didn't matter. The rest of the world would move on in a world where they died, but they'd just re-set their lives. The fact that this accident involved Kayla is what scared me.

Blood all over the street; pieces of her hair reached the other sidewalk. I couldn't breathe properly. My hand had covered my mouth and nose, so of course I couldn't. The weird thing? She was smiling. Her lips appeared to be saying something... I couldn't hear her, but her mouth was in the shape of an O before she lost consciousness one final time.

"Would you like to try again?"

The voice sounded in my head. I had heard it plenty of times, usually saying "No," each time, this time I screamed out a "Yes! Give me another chance!"

"Very well, as per the agreement, you may keep the memories of what transpired today. But know that no one else will. Also, anyone else choses to re-set today, your day will also be re-set."

I woke up with a start. What was that? Was that a dream? A vision?

It didn't matter. Today, I was meeting up with Kayla.

She had her cat! She always brought her cat with her, every time we met. It was kind of cute in a way. I sat on a swing next to her.

"You know, James?" She asked me, "I've never been a big fan of Summer time."

"It's always so hot, right?"

"Yeah... how'd you- MIKU!"

The cat began to run away, and she began to chase, but I stopped her.

"Don't... trust me, it's better that you don't chase her immediately."

"Why do you say that?"

"I... I think I had a vision last night, and it involved everything exactly as it's gone so far today, so I don't think you should chase after Miku yet."

Shortly after Miku got across the street, a truck zoomed by. Kayla looked at me with a sense of confusion, but I just nodded as if to say 'Now you can go.'

We chased the cat through across the street, through an alleyway, and just on the safe side of a construction site. Well, I thought it was safe.

All I heard was a snap, followed by a crunch. Turning around, I saw Kayla's body... on the ground, the girder had landed directly on her head.

"Would you like to try again?"

There it was again! Why is it coming mid-day? Did the first 7,000 attempts at this day end with me asking to re-set early? I naturally screamed "Yes!" as loud as I could.

"Very well, as per the agreement, you may keep the memories of what transpired today. But know that no one else will. Also, anyone else choses to re-set today, your day will also be re-set."

She fell down the stairs this time.

We ran into a mugger... who shot her as she tried to protect me.

I tried canceling our meeting... I guess I was the only thing keeping her from hanging herself

Another truck... that was the 5th truck in the past 25 attempts.

Aug 14 - 10,900

When even was the first try I remembered? Seven thousand... Two Hundred? Something like that... That means I've remembered over ten years of watching the woman I've come to love die. Over, and over, and over again. That doesn't even include over twenty years of what I don't remember. Trucks, muggings, stabbings, falling down stairs, jumping off buildings, committing suicide in numerous ways, if you can think of a way to die, I've probably seen it happen to her.

"You know, James?" She asked me, "I've never been a big fan of Summer time."

"Really? Why's that?"

"It's always so hot! Why can't it be- MIKU!"

I had already leaped ahead of her. I had a plan, and it had to work.

As the truck came barreling through the street at full speed, I saw it... one final time.

"Would you like to try again?"

I didn't have the time to answer as the truck hit me. My vision became blurry, and all I could see was the sky. I never even realized just how pretty the clouds were today... well, what few of them there were...

I saw Kayla's face appear in front of me. "James?"

The voice asked again: "Would you like to try again?"

"No thank you." I replied, barely able to force a smile out. "I think I'm good."

I remember nothing more.

Aug 14 - 500

I woke up in my bed, alone, and checked my hand. It had become a routine, checking my hand to see what number of repeat I was on. I felt pretty good, since that number had never gone above a 1. So for a second, I was confused by the 500 that appeared on my hand.

But that didn't matter, I had agreed to meet with James at the park.
