I hit the car with the rake. I don't know if its going to grunt or something, but its worth a shot. I hit it again, this time with more force. The car stays silent. I guess its just another ordinary automobile. I move on to the next one. 

I can see someone watching me from the apartment complex nearby. They'll must probably think I'm mad, walking around and hitting cars with a rake. I bet they'll take a video of me and put it on the internet or something. I hope they'll keep the camera on when I strike gold. 

This car's also clear. I didn't expect it not to be, really. This is a Silver Ford, and that... thing... became a White Chevrolet. I saw it, clear as day. I didn't tell anyone. They'd call me mad. When you're hunting something out of the ordinary, don't rely on the help of others. They won't believe you.

I move on to the next car. A White Chevrolet. I raise my rake above my head, and bring it down with the force of a train engine. The car's alarm goes off. More people start looking out their window, then stick their heads back inside after seeing me. Well, this isn't the right one, I guess. Time to--

The car starts converting into something else. Its wheels and body and windows start shifting, becoming something larger. Humanoid, but not human at all. It transformed with the fluidity of an organism, but there was nothing organic to it. It was an amalgamation of automotive and mechanical parts that formed the eight-meter-tall behemoth that stood in front of me. There was a red emblem on its shoulder, one which vaguely resembled a face with huge eyebrows, a rectangular nose, and a triangle in its forehead. The behemoth opened its mouth to speak.

"What do you want from me, human?"
