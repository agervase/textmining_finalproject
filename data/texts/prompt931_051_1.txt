I was - and still am - widely known throughout the (known) universes as the Islamic time traveler. Stopping Taliban in 2025? That was me. I was the fall of ISIS. Hey, pay me, and I'll create a group for your political needs too. Don't judge me. But then I got a conscience which ate me up. I went to Hajj every year, and my soul was still not cleansed. *What do I do?* I went to all the planets, to the edge of the most beautiful galaxy, The Buchanan Quarry on Paquin (you humans haven't heard of it if you're reading this before 5425). Still, peace would not come. 

However, just when all hope was lost, there was finally a chance of atonement. I was in the mosque of al-Fihri, named after the famed and world renowned Fatima al-Fihri. The same woman who built the very first university, the University of Al Quaraouiyine, in Morocco. I was there for that. I didn't interact with her of course, I couldn't. Not in the presence of such a woman. Anyway, the mosque is very beautiful situated in the city of Al ‘Awāmīyah. It was in a rectangular shape with white stone. The four corners had minarets that stood ten meters high adorned with gold domes. The call to prayer was said to be heard for miles. I always enjoyed Bilal's voice. In the centre of the mosque, stood a bright green dome, there as a tribute to Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, in Medina. Inside the mosque there were two prayer halls. Yes, mosques are still segregated in the year 6010, but these days, so are all religious buildings. Some men blame Feminism. I really don't care. Women are always trouble, I learned my lesson. *Never again.* The men's hall was adorned with orange and lime prayer carpets, pointing to Mecca. The windows were exquisitely decorated in symmetrical patterns, reminiscent of the old Arab illustrations. I was deep in thought when the Imam came to me. Only he knew my secret. 

He is an athletic man. 6"7' with a bushy but clean beard. Whenever, I saw him, which incidentally Jumm'ah today, he always wore the best Islamic tunics, I always thought.

"Assalam-Alaykum, Abu Waqht," he greeted me.

"Walaikum-Salaam, Imam. Great sermon today. It was nice of you to stress the importance of caring for our women."

"Yes, some of our men still need reminding," and looked at me sharply. *Fuck you man, you don't know the full story. She only told you a quarter. Don't judge me.* 

"Praying to Allah that they are reminded quickly."

"Have you heard about the new `mission` going around?" Whispering the word mission, as he should. 

"No, what is it?" I asked eagerly interested. I lost last year. Not again.

"Killing Hitler. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty."

So there I was, inside Hitler's office. 3^rd in command. I knew I had to make it more difficult to kill Hitler rather than creativity. That's what happened in 6009. I was listening to him blabber away, when it suddenly hit me. *Kill him and make it look like a suicide*. The question was when. Well I knew that Poland was about to be invaded and would fall to the Soviets. I knew then, that I had to be the one to tell him the unfortunate news. But I was only 3^rd in command. Luckily for me, I went for the long con. I had been there, by his side, for three years. It was the 21^st of April 1945 that marked my 3^rd year. No, dear readers I couldn't stop the war. Fixed events and all that.

I remember it clearly now. As I heard that the Soviets were closing in I made it to the bunker, ensuring that I was the first.

"Fuhrer, the Soviets have taken Poland," I said in a feigned panicked breath.

"AAARRGHH, my commanders are incompe*tent fools!!!* What am I supposed to do now?" Shouting his question at me.

"Well Fuhrer, you could -," at which point I got out my pistol, and shot him in the mouth with the bullet going into his head killing him instantly. "Kill yourself," I continued. Yes I felt awesome. It was a success. I then placed some cyanide in his mouth, and quickly exited. 

It was only at the judging ceremony that as I let a few historicity slide I lost a few points, but overall, they liked my plan the best.  Peace at last, I thought to myself. *Thought* being the key word.
