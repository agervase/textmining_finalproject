"Stop talking in the third person Patrick you annoying prick!" I shouted back at the six foot penguin who had just crashed my dinner-for-two, "I'm on a date with a hot chick!"
\n"Are you... Ok?" Cindy asked.
"What? Oh - yeah sorry I was just-"
"I should be going..." She said grabbing her coat and standing up, "dinner was nice!" 
As I watched her power walk out of the restaurant I looked down at the half eaten seafood chowder and one-third glass of white she had left in her wake. 
"The bill sir?" Asked a waiter who had witnesses the entire episode. As I looked up at him I realized the entire restaurant had come to a stand still and everyone was looking at me.
"Kill them all Craig, kill them all..." Patrick whispered in my ear.
"Your a dick." I mumbled back as Patrick started to chuckle. 
"Sir?" The waiter replied.
"I have amex"
"Ah, I'll be right back"
Patrick waddled to the other side of the table and plopped him self in Cindy's abandoned seat.
"She was boring anyway- we don't need her!"
He started to peck at her plate in an attempt to get at the scallops and mussles left behind. 


I was completely defeated, Cindy was the first girl I had met in the city willing to go out with me and I couldn't even keep Patrick away for more than an hour. The new meds Dr. Tommen had given didn't work, nothing works.
"You can't even eat those, you're not real..." I said. 
"Oh I'm not sitting here craig - you are." 
The restaurant started to spin and I blacked out, when I woke up I was face down in seafood chowder with a paramedic checking my pulse. Turns out I wasn't supposed to drink while on that new medication....
