Clubbed to death by angry tribesmen, stabbed in the back by my best friend, killed slowly by disease, executed for stealing a loaf of bread. I fell from a horse and broke my neck. I rose to be a king and died of old age. My lives have been many, my deaths have been varied. 


It's always the same thing. I live, I die, and I am reborn as a young child; I remember everything. I remember what I drank in a pub on some random night. I remember the flea bite that itched at me for days. I remember it all.


Worst of all, I remember the pain. I remember my loves, both woman and man. I remember the passionate days and nights but they bring me naught but sadness, because I remember the heartbreaks, their deaths, their betrayels, and mine.


By my count, and I know it is accurate, I have lived for two thousand, three hundred and twenty six years. I have lived eighty-seven lives in that time. Some fleeting, some never-ending, and each time I am reborn, remembering them all; they change me. I am not the man I was in my first life. I am not that naive. Nor am I the man I was in my thirty-third life. I am not that cruel. I am a combination of each man I have been. 


Most of all, I am a tired man.


I have spent the last seven of my lives seeking for a way to end this curse. And make no mistake, this is a curse. It is a pox upon me. I want this to end. I have lived to long, I remember too much. Only... Only, I don't remember the curse. I remember everything else, but the curse. How I came to have it, how I can be rid of it - they are empty voids that I can not even get close to in my memories. 

I am immortal, I am cursed, and now I trawl that great invention -the internet - day after day and night after night hoping to find a cure, or someone else just like me.
