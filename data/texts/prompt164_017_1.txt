My minestrone was ruined. 

"There really wasn't that much broth." I thought as a heavy amount of the rich, nearly golden, brown liquid impacted the better part of left side of my face, followed quite swiftly by a shower of crimson kidney beans, sweetly roasted bell peppers, charming little orecchiette half-shell noodles, strips of baked zucchini, and a myriad of other diced squashes. 

Oh and then the celery. 

And then the bowl. 

The celery was probably the worst. It didn't manage to imbibe the the piquancy of the tomato broth it was cooked in as well as the other vegetables, and the bitterness overshadowed the subtle combination of oregano, thyme, black pepper, and sage that so well suited the rest of the dish. 

As the plenitude of broth, pasta, and vegetables dropped down over my arms, which had failed to protect me from the onslaught, my mood dropped with it. Then, like the wet leaf of spinach and sundried tomato that we're stuck to my lower left cheekbone, something stuck in me. 

It was fear. 

The sagacious shark whom had leapt out of my delicious dinner and covered me with it thrashed about upon the double long, wooden table. The eggplant parmesan smacked against the wall in a shower of cheese, tomato, and ceramic, and with another swift smack of the tail my dates ricotta primavera was flung outward, creating a volley of thin, colorful noodles over anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. 

Smoke billowed from the sharks black gills as the beast thrashed about, confused restaurant staff and dinner guests alike sought cover from the onslaught of savory dishes. I don't think sharks have vocal chords, but it seemed to give something close to what one would call a hearty, booming laugh with each flick of the tail and each meal ruined. 

I thought my deceased soup for just another second, but a second too long.
