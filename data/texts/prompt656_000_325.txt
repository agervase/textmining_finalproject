I got ten months for it.

It was an accident, but since I was on the phone...

Anyhow, I met another while I was in there. I caught sight of his tattoo before he saw mine - his XP bar about two-thirds full... with a small "3" under it. I tried my best to keep mine hidden after that.

The first chance I got to talk to him was three days later.

"Paul, right?" I said trying to maintain calm.

He gave a slight nod and his eyes studied mine. "You?" He asked.

"I'm Markus" I said, sitting down across the table. "What are you in for?"

"A couple murders" He said, his eyes never looking away. "You?" He asked again.

"Yea. Manslaughter. - Uhh, Involuntary" I admitted. He grinned slightly.

"What's your tat" I asked, pointing to his hand. At this, he straightened up still staring me directly in the eyes. Oops. Too direct.

"Every time I kill, I fill in the bar a little more. You know... like a video game exp bar. Just a little..." he trailed off. Pause...

Before I could react his arms darted forward and grabbed mine. He pulled my hand upright up onto the table and swiftly smashed my closed first against the steel surface. My clenched fist opened in pain and he saw my  tattoo, one-third full. He smiled a devilish smile. "Level one still?... I'm on 3".

My horrified and surprised expression betrayed me and his smile widened.

"Everything.. you know.... about your life.. is.... a... lie." Paul explained. He let go slowly and motioned me to follow him as he stood up.

"Now... how would you like to... play some co-op?"

"What are you talking about? What game are we even playing??"

He responded as he walked away: "It's called... "*Outside*.""
