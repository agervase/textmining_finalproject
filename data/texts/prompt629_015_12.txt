I blinked… or whatever amounts to blinking as a formless consciousness. Before me sat many gods, some I recognized and some that I didn’t. Well fuck me surprised there is something after death, and what’s more it was very earth centric in those who wished to judge me. I had been confirmed Catholic before I realized how ludicrous religion was, and became an atheist, which is probably why the god of Abraham was fast approaching. 
“He is mine by his own confirmation” He bellowed.
“Not so fast,” screamed Bhal.
A brawl began between some of the gods, most of the male persuasion. I was baffled as to why gods would stick with one gender, until I remembered Dionysus. Never mind these tools I have a deal to make. 
“Odin I would have a word with you.” 
The one eyed god looked like I had just taken away his favorite toy as he pried himself from the melee. 
“Have you chosen mortal? Am I to be your patron?”
“The choice is easy All Father, I died in a struggle. I fought my enemies in more brave a fashion than any of your followers. I expected nothing after death and still took up arms to defend my home. There are only three places I could end up Valhalla, Folkvang, or Elysium. To eat drink and fight while awaiting the final great battle would serve well don’t you think?”
“For wisdom I gave my eye child and in your words I see it. Come with me, the finest mead awaits.”
As we moved the other gods faded from my sight and I began to once again take form. A horn of mead already in one hand a roasted bird leg in the other. I stopped.
“All Father, if we are to prepare for Ragnarok, should we not practice our raiding? On the harp playing hypocrites in the Christion heaven for instance?”
Odin beamed with pride, “You are worthy of my great hall boy. Let us draw up the battle plans tonight.”
