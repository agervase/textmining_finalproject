 He paused for moment, and I felt my blood run cold.

“Yes you have, when you were getting your EEG done. You fell asleep and sleep talked for almost two whole minutes before we woke you up.” He said matter of fact. Heat instantly creeped up from my chest, into my cheeks. *Why am I so paranoid?* Dr. Tim was one of the most trustworthy people I had ever met. 

He had instantly validated the *Voice* when I had come to him, and he hadn’t even been a psychiatrist. Having the kindness and patience to sit through my meltdowns, as a surgeon of all things, had been a great comfort to me after years of isolation.

*Don’t take it*, she said, *it’s a trap.*

I ignored her, freedom was sitting in my hand in the form of two white pills. They were small and nondescript, harmless looking really.

*You’ll regret this. You’ll be all alone, forever. Alone in life, alone in death.* She was speaking a little faster, her voice rushed. *You’ll fail without me, I have given you everything. Your house, your car, your success-*

“You’ve given me hell.” I said outloud.

I took the glass of water without another second to waste, and swallowed both pills in one swig.

I closed my eyes. Waiting. Any second now, her voice would come back. I knew it would, it always would.

I waited, and my mind remained silent. I smiled, I was finally free.

“Thank you Dr. Tim.” I opened my eyes, “You’ve given me-“ 

Dr. Tim was no longer there. In his place was a woman. 

She wore a lab coat, like Dr. Tim. Her hair was long and dark, it shined like oil, giving off hints of other dark hues. Her face was angular and sharp, like a fox, and the similarity was even more prominent from the coy smile she sported.

“*What a gullible little girl.*” The voice. 

“Sana.” I whimpered.

“*Don’t worry, I’ll dispose of your body quickly. You served well as a host.*” She said, twirling a larger than life scythe behind her back.
