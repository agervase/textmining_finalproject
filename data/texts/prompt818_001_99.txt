“I remember everything. I remember how I used to always sit under this tree hoping fortune would come my way. And just when I gave up, you…”

*“What are you doing, sitting here all by yourself?” you ask, fanning yourself with your book.*

*“What do you mean? It’s a sunny day. I needed some shade.”*

*“But this is my spot. I always come here to read. I’ve never seen you here before.”*

*"I've never seen* you *here before."*

*"I always come on Sunday."*

*“I don’t see any signs. Do you have a deed?”*

*“I guess not.” You look disappointed. “Well, how much longer are you going to be here?”*

*“I don’t know. I guess I can get up. Just gimme a second. Let me take another look at it.”*

*“At what?” you ask, finally shifting over to my view, looking over the town, the college, the shining sea beyond.*

*“Time.”*

*“Time?”*

*“Time passes everywhere I go. People walking, cars driving, birds flying, it’s just signs of time passing. It makes me so sad. Here, everything is so small, and from the right angle, nothing changes. The buildings, the sky, the water…it’s all frozen. Time is frozen.”*

*You sit down next to me, and take a long look, seeing it for the first time. “Why are you so afraid of time?”*

*46 years old*

*You sit, and look out at the water, and I look at you. Your face betrays no sadness, and that is precisely what fills me with it, knowing all your strength is being used to keep a straight face.*

*“It’s just something you never think will happen, losing your baby.”*

*“It’s not your fault,” I repeat for the umpteenth time.*

*“It’s the world’s,” you say, your voice empty, devoid. “That’s what hurts the most. I used to believe this spot was special, that time really didn't change when we were here. But...that's just another trick.”*

*I say nothing. There is nothing to say.*

*“It’s broken,” you say. “Our life, everything felt so strong…but it was really just fragile. And now it’s been broken, and now the pieces can’t be put back together.”*

*“Don’t say that-“*

*“She’s gone. Our baby is gone. And she can’t come back. What’s going to fix that?”*

*I didn’t answer. I wish...*

“I wish I had. I wish I had saved our baby, lying on the road in front of that van, her neck broken. I wish I had saved you, in that hospital bed, when all you could do was look at me. Were you asking me to?”

The tree does not answer. I sit down under it, maybe for the final time. It is dying, it’s branches dropping and its sturdy trunk hunched over like a human’s.

My father had told me our power was a curse, to never be able to use it. As a child, I hadn't understood.

I stand up, now, and face the tree. It's time to leave. Time slows for no one, and it’s best not to sit back and let it run up the score on you. For some reason, I am possessed by an almost preternatural urge to hug the tree.

And so I do, for a long moment, long enough that I question whether it will end-

“Thank you,” a deep, gravelly voice says.

I do nothing. I am sure I must have imagined it.

“We must hurry. They will be here soon. They must have detected the magic.”

Now, I step back. In the fading sunlight, I see it, a face in the folds, the branches, and I question my sanity.

“What?” I ask.

“It has been years. But they told me you would come – one weathered by tragedy and loss, and bring me back to life. Come now. We don’t have much time.”

And the tree…stands, somehow, its legs filled with roots and branches and growths.

“To do what?” I ask.

“To change time. To defeat that which takes all from us in this world. Will you come?”

It reaches out a branch to me, a suddenly long, sturdy branch.

I take one look behind me, at the rare moment time defeats my view, when the sun fades and the colors warp and day dies so night can be born.

“Let’s go.”
